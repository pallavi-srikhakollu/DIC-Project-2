In any case, you have to admit the NBA never fails to entertain.More from Yahoo Sports: • Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight When spring training camps opened this week around Major League Baseball, it brought hope that maybe, finally, Bryce Harper and Manny Machado would sign with teams and baseball’s long free-agent freeze would melt away.Nope. Not yet. Not only has that not happened, something else did happen: a number of talented young players around the league have agreed to team-friendly contract extensions.The latest was New York Yankees ace Luis Severino, who on Friday reportedly agreed to a four-year, $40 million deal. The deal, first reported by Joel Sherman of the New York Post, would buy up Severino’s arbitration years and comes with a $15 million club option for his first year of free agency.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]By agreeing to this deal, the Yankees and Severino avoid arbitration for 2019. He’ll make $4 million this season, $10 million next, then $10.25 million in 2021 and $11 million in 2022. The club option is for 2023. In the grand scheme of society, this is a very generous contract. In baseball’s economic bubble, it’s another young player signing for below-market value relative to his skills and potential.It’s hard to blame Severino for taking the deal, looking around at a free-agent world where Harper and Machado are still available, as are Dallas Keuchel and Craig Kimbrel. Especially since we haven’t heard even slight grumblings about teams being interested in Keuchel and Kimbrel.Coming off a breakout season in which he went 19-8 with a 3.39 ERA, the 25-year-old Severino was given a deal that’s pretty hard to turn down: “Do you want $40 million guaranteed, yes or no?”The other players faced with a similar question this week were Philadelphia Phillies ace Aaron Nola, who said yes to a four-year, $45 million deal Wednesday. It also avoided arbitration and bought out two of Nola’s free agency years, making it the most below-market deal of any of these.The Minnesota Twins locked up two of their talented young players Thursday, as right fielder Max Kepler agreed to a five-year, $35 million deal with a $10 million club option for 2024. It buys out three years of free agency for Kepler, 26. Shortstop Jorge Polanco also agreed to a five-year extension, his is worth $25.75 million with two option years that could keep him in Minnesota through 2025.In a vacuum, these types of extensions look like win-wins: The players get guaranteed money as they’re coming off good seasons. The clubs get cost-certainty to help them navigate the future — whether it’s the Yankees and Phillies trying to add big free agents this year or next, or a team like the Twins striving for contention with a homegrown core.In a bigger sense, though, it’s hard not to look at these deals in the current state of free agency and wonder if they’re a symptom of something else. Is it the market correcting itself? Is it baseball’s economy morphing into something new? Or maybe it’s just players looking around and saying, “Well, I better get my money now.”According to numerous reports, there’s a fear that for this generation of young players the light at the end of the tunnel — the big free-agency payday — won’t be there for them in the same way it was for so many other players.So while it’s great that stars like Justin Verlander, Clayton Kershaw and Max Scherzer are publicly speaking out about the current state of free agency, they’re on the right side of it.

The best recent example is Mike Trout winning the MVP in 2014 at age 22 while making $1 million.He got a raise to $6 million the next season, but in 2015 was still making a fraction of what people like Ryan Howard ($25M), Albert Pujols ($24M), Joe Mauer ($23M), Mark Teixeira ($22.5M) and Jose Reyes ($22M) were making.But that overpay is a necessary part baseball’s economic ecosystem too. It’s a fact: Players get overpaid as their careers decline. It’s almost like baseball’s way of making up for underpaying players during their early years. It’s baseball’s golden parachute. What’s happening these days is fewer teams are accepting that overpay as part of the how the system works.In the past few years, arbitration salaries have gotten higher and higher, and teams have tried harder to lock up younger stars before free agency. It’s why we’ve see players like Madison Bumgarner, Chris Archer, Chris Sale and Paul Goldschmidt become valuable trade chips for their team-friendly contract extensions.Teams are getting smarter about where their money goes, and how to keep value in their assets. These extensions to Severino, Nola and the rest show that they’re willing to spend money, just in the way that they want.Earlier this week, former Miami Marlins president David Samson tweeted something in response to Justin Verlander, saying the “broken system” talk was wrong. Players and their agents, Samson said, needed to adjust to a “new reality.”He may be right about the new reality part. The monster paydays at the end of the free agency tunnel could be fading away.

But in all seriousness, the jersey presents some interesting questions: Will it be easier for fans to “bandwagon”? Can players switch jerseys mid-game? Will Drake be first in line for this new prop?Meanwhile, Twitter had all of the jokes.Jersey cost only 20 easy installments of, $999.99.— Vod Kanockers (@JHoward2716) February 15, 2019Kevin Durant can now switch teams mid game with these new #NBA jerseys 😳 pic.twitter.com/a01rMkiexr— OT Sports Podcast Network (@OTSportsPod) February 15, 2019This could go one of two ways: Either the NBA will have found another way to separate itself from the other sports leagues or it will be a pointless feature that exists just because there is the technology to make it happen and for Twitter to crack jokes. In any case, you have to admit the NBA never fails to entertain.More from Yahoo Sports: • Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight When spring training camps opened this week around Major League Baseball, it brought hope that maybe, finally, Bryce Harper and Manny Machado would sign with teams and baseball’s long free-agent freeze would melt away.Nope. Not yet. Not only has that not happened, something else did happen: a number of talented young players around the league have agreed to team-friendly contract extensions.The latest was New York Yankees ace Luis Severino, who on Friday reportedly agreed to a four-year, $40 million deal. The deal, first reported by Joel Sherman of the New York Post, would buy up Severino’s arbitration years and comes with a $15 million club option for his first year of free agency.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]By agreeing to this deal, the Yankees and Severino avoid arbitration for 2019. He’ll make $4 million this season, $10 million next, then $10.25 million in 2021 and $11 million in 2022. The club option is for 2023. In the grand scheme of society, this is a very generous contract. In baseball’s economic bubble, it’s another young player signing for below-market value relative to his skills and potential.It’s hard to blame Severino for taking the deal, looking around at a free-agent world where Harper and Machado are still available, as are Dallas Keuchel and Craig Kimbrel. Especially since we haven’t heard even slight grumblings about teams being interested in Keuchel and Kimbrel.Coming off a breakout season in which he went 19-8 with a 3.39 ERA, the 25-year-old Severino was given a deal that’s pretty hard to turn down: “Do you want $40 million guaranteed, yes or no?”The other players faced with a similar question this week were Philadelphia Phillies ace Aaron Nola, who said yes to a four-year, $45 million deal Wednesday. It also avoided arbitration and bought out two of Nola’s free agency years, making it the most below-market deal of any of these.The Minnesota Twins locked up two of their talented young players Thursday, as right fielder Max Kepler agreed to a five-year, $35 million deal with a $10 million club option for 2024. It buys out three years of free agency for Kepler, 26. Shortstop Jorge Polanco also agreed to a five-year extension, his is worth $25.75 million with two option years that could keep him in Minnesota through 2025.In a vacuum, these types of extensions look like win-wins: The players get guaranteed money as they’re coming off good seasons. The clubs get cost-certainty to help them navigate the future — whether it’s the Yankees and Phillies trying to add big free agents this year or next, or a team like the Twins striving for contention with a homegrown core.In a bigger sense, though, it’s hard not to look at these deals in the current state of free agency and wonder if they’re a symptom of something else. Is it the market correcting itself? Is it baseball’s economy morphing into something new? Or maybe it’s just players looking around and saying, “Well, I better get my money now.”According to numerous reports, there’s a fear that for this generation of young players the light at the end of the tunnel — the big free-agency payday — won’t be there for them in the same way it was for so many other players.So while it’s great that stars like Justin Verlander, Clayton Kershaw and Max Scherzer are publicly speaking out about the current state of free agency, they’re on the right side of it.

However, Wainwright framed the situation with a little more urgency on Friday by expressing concerns that a day of reckoning could happen sooner than later.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]Speaking to InsideSTL.com’s Tim McKernan, Wainwright said it was inevitable that the players will go on strike unless major changes are made to help bridge the widening gap. But he’s also worried that frustrations could reach a boiling point during the season leading to some form of a revolt. Perhaps even a mid-season walkout.#STLCards pitcher Adam Wainwright on @TMASTL: “Unless something changes, there’s going to be a strike. 100%. I’m just worried people are going to walk-out mid-season.” pic.twitter.com/M8WeRVcASe— Tim McKernan (@tmckernan) February 15, 2019“Unless something changes, there’s going to be a strike. 100%,” Wainwright said regarding the free-agent freeze that has left stars like Bryce Harper and Manny Machado without contracts. “I’m just worried people are going to walkout midseason.”It’s conceivable given the current climate, but a players revolt on that level still feels like a long shot. The target date we should all still be looking at is Dec. 1, 2021. That’s when the current collective bargaining agreement ends and the owners will be forced to come to the table.That doesn’t mean we should just dismiss Wainwright’s concerns about a 2019 strike. While they might feel a little on the dramatic side, the frustration that has built all offseason as dozens of free agents, including and especially Harper and Machado, remain unsigned is becoming more palpable by the day. There’s a genuine feeling that owners are determined to cut back on salaries even as profits continue to reach new heights, it’s possible the players’ patience will run out if the free-agent freeze continues to drag on. Wainwright thinks so, and he’s far from alone.In Friday’s interview, the 37-year-old right-hander also criticized owners and front offense personnel for placing too much emphasis on “analytics” and placing everything in a “sabermetric box” that discounts intangibles and other immeasurable aspects of baseball.Adam Wainwright said today on ⁦@TMASTL⁩ that he expects there to be a strike “100%.”The context of the conversation comes from a discussion on how Bryce Harper and Manny Machado are still without teams.You can see Wainwright’s reasoning in the video below. pic.twitter.com/GXsmx4cXk1— Tim McKernan (@tmckernan) February 15, 2019Wainwright admitted that there’s always risk in making long-term financial commitments to players, but emphasized that doing so marks a commitment to winning that several teams seemingly lack.“Part of it is smart from their side of it, but you have to realize it’s about winning. So, if Bryce Harper wants 10 years and he’s 26 years old. He’s going to be a dynamic player. The same can be said about Manny Machado. These guys are superstar players.”The deeper we get into it the more obvious it is that the players know what battles lie ahead. The only real question is how much worse it will get before any progress is made toward a satisfactory resolution.More from Yahoo Sports:• Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight \n"

In any case, you have to admit the NBA never fails to entertain.More from Yahoo Sports: • Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight When spring training camps opened this week around Major League Baseball, it brought hope that maybe, finally, Bryce Harper and Manny Machado would sign with teams and baseball’s long free-agent freeze would melt away.Nope. Not yet. Not only has that not happened, something else did happen: a number of talented young players around the league have agreed to team-friendly contract extensions.The latest was New York Yankees ace Luis Severino, who on Friday reportedly agreed to a four-year, $40 million deal. The deal, first reported by Joel Sherman of the New York Post, would buy up Severino’s arbitration years and comes with a $15 million club option for his first year of free agency.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]By agreeing to this deal, the Yankees and Severino avoid arbitration for 2019. He’ll make $4 million this season, $10 million next, then $10.25 million in 2021 and $11 million in 2022. The club option is for 2023. In the grand scheme of society, this is a very generous contract. In baseball’s economic bubble, it’s another young player signing for below-market value relative to his skills and potential.It’s hard to blame Severino for taking the deal, looking around at a free-agent world where Harper and Machado are still available, as are Dallas Keuchel and Craig Kimbrel. Especially since we haven’t heard even slight grumblings about teams being interested in Keuchel and Kimbrel.Coming off a breakout season in which he went 19-8 with a 3.39 ERA, the 25-year-old Severino was given a deal that’s pretty hard to turn down: “Do you want $40 million guaranteed, yes or no?”The other players faced with a similar question this week were Philadelphia Phillies ace Aaron Nola, who said yes to a four-year, $45 million deal Wednesday. It also avoided arbitration and bought out two of Nola’s free agency years, making it the most below-market deal of any of these.The Minnesota Twins locked up two of their talented young players Thursday, as right fielder Max Kepler agreed to a five-year, $35 million deal with a $10 million club option for 2024. It buys out three years of free agency for Kepler, 26. Shortstop Jorge Polanco also agreed to a five-year extension, his is worth $25.75 million with two option years that could keep him in Minnesota through 2025.In a vacuum, these types of extensions look like win-wins: The players get guaranteed money as they’re coming off good seasons. The clubs get cost-certainty to help them navigate the future — whether it’s the Yankees and Phillies trying to add big free agents this year or next, or a team like the Twins striving for contention with a homegrown core.In a bigger sense, though, it’s hard not to look at these deals in the current state of free agency and wonder if they’re a symptom of something else. Is it the market correcting itself? Is it baseball’s economy morphing into something new? Or maybe it’s just players looking around and saying, “Well, I better get my money now.”According to numerous reports, there’s a fear that for this generation of young players the light at the end of the tunnel — the big free-agency payday — won’t be there for them in the same way it was for so many other players.So while it’s great that stars like Justin Verlander, Clayton Kershaw and Max Scherzer are publicly speaking out about the current state of free agency, they’re on the right side of it. They got their mega deals.The younger players find themselves in a different sort of peril. It’s entirely possible that these are the biggest paydays these players ever get, which is a much different economic model that we’ve seen from baseball in the past.Whether it’s right or wrong — and that’s certainly something that’s up for debate heading into the next collective-bargaining agreement — baseball’s economy has often been backward. Players get paid less, relative to the market, in their pre-free agency years. The best recent example is Mike Trout winning the MVP in 2014 at age 22 while making $1 million.He got a raise to $6 million the next season, but in 2015 was still making a fraction of what people like Ryan Howard ($25M), Albert Pujols ($24M), Joe Mauer ($23M), Mark Teixeira ($22.5M) and Jose Reyes ($22M) were making.But that overpay is a necessary part baseball’s economic ecosystem too. It’s a fact: Players get overpaid as their careers decline. It’s almost like baseball’s way of making up for underpaying players during their early years. It’s baseball’s golden parachute. What’s happening these days is fewer teams are accepting that overpay as part of the how the system works.In the past few years, arbitration salaries have gotten higher and higher, and teams have tried harder to lock up younger stars before free agency. It’s why we’ve see players like Madison Bumgarner, Chris Archer, Chris Sale and Paul Goldschmidt become valuable trade chips for their team-friendly contract extensions.Teams are getting smarter about where their money goes, and how to keep value in their assets. These extensions to Severino, Nola and the rest show that they’re willing to spend money, just in the way that they want.Earlier this week, former Miami Marlins president David Samson tweeted something in response to Justin Verlander, saying the “broken system” talk was wrong. Players and their agents, Samson said, needed to adjust to a “new reality.”He may be right about the new reality part. The monster paydays at the end of the free agency tunnel could be fading away. If Bryce Harper and Manny Machado can’t get them, who can?The new reality could be players seizing their money. Whenever they can.– – – – – –Mike Oz is a writer at Yahoo Sports.

However, Wainwright framed the situation with a little more urgency on Friday by expressing concerns that a day of reckoning could happen sooner than later.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]Speaking to InsideSTL.com’s Tim McKernan, Wainwright said it was inevitable that the players will go on strike unless major changes are made to help bridge the widening gap. But he’s also worried that frustrations could reach a boiling point during the season leading to some form of a revolt. Perhaps even a mid-season walkout.#STLCards pitcher Adam Wainwright on @TMASTL: “Unless something changes, there’s going to be a strike. 100%. I’m just worried people are going to walk-out mid-season.” pic.twitter.com/M8WeRVcASe— Tim McKernan (@tmckernan) February 15, 2019“Unless something changes, there’s going to be a strike. 100%,” Wainwright said regarding the free-agent freeze that has left stars like Bryce Harper and Manny Machado without contracts. “I’m just worried people are going to walkout midseason.”It’s conceivable given the current climate, but a players revolt on that level still feels like a long shot. The target date we should all still be looking at is Dec. 1, 2021. That’s when the current collective bargaining agreement ends and the owners will be forced to come to the table.That doesn’t mean we should just dismiss Wainwright’s concerns about a 2019 strike. While they might feel a little on the dramatic side, the frustration that has built all offseason as dozens of free agents, including and especially Harper and Machado, remain unsigned is becoming more palpable by the day. There’s a genuine feeling that owners are determined to cut back on salaries even as profits continue to reach new heights, it’s possible the players’ patience will run out if the free-agent freeze continues to drag on. Wainwright thinks so, and he’s far from alone.In Friday’s interview, the 37-year-old right-hander also criticized owners and front offense personnel for placing too much emphasis on “analytics” and placing everything in a “sabermetric box” that discounts intangibles and other immeasurable aspects of baseball.Adam Wainwright said today on ⁦@TMASTL⁩ that he expects there to be a strike “100%.”The context of the conversation comes from a discussion on how Bryce Harper and Manny Machado are still without teams.You can see Wainwright’s reasoning in the video below. pic.twitter.com/GXsmx4cXk1— Tim McKernan (@tmckernan) February 15, 2019Wainwright admitted that there’s always risk in making long-term financial commitments to players, but emphasized that doing so marks a commitment to winning that several teams seemingly lack.“Part of it is smart from their side of it, but you have to realize it’s about winning. So, if Bryce Harper wants 10 years and he’s 26 years old. He’s going to be a dynamic player. The same can be said about Manny Machado. These guys are superstar players.”The deeper we get into it the more obvious it is that the players know what battles lie ahead. The only real question is how much worse it will get before any progress is made toward a satisfactory resolution.More from Yahoo Sports:• Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight MLB rumors: Bryce Harper has made his decision, says D.C. radio host originally appeared on nbcsportsbayarea.comA report has come out from the East Coast saying Bryce Harper has come to a decision on which team he will play for in 2019 and beyond.Chris Russell, a sports radio talk show host from 106.7 The Fan in Washington D.C., (who has been on the Harper beat for some time) said the free agent slugger could make a decision in the next 24 hours.\"Maybe I took a little bit of a leap of faith here based on some indications I got from a real good source,\" Russell told 94WIP, in Philadelphia, on Friday.\"Bryce and his representatives, (Scott) Boras, his people, his wife Kayla, they've been meeting since Monday morning in Vegas. Bryce originally wanted this done, when it took this long, by Valentine's Day. Obviously, the contract has not been announced, signed, or whatever.\"\"But I'm led to believe by the people that I've talked to that are close to the situation -- and I have, again, a real good source that has helped me through this process, let's just leave it at that,\" Russell said. \"That Bryce was in a mood to celebrate yesterday. Now, the source said, 'I believe it's done.' I don't have concrete, 100 percent proof for you guys. I wish I did, otherwise, I would have it and I would be running around with it. But I don't have that, so I want to caution everybody in Philadelphia. But that's what I was led to believe, that this thing is now decided.\"Russell then mentioned the Phillies.\"Now, what comes then is hammering out a contract. And if we were to believe the report that the Philadelphia Phillies had not even extended a formal offer -- and I assume that to be a termed, written agreement, that type of thing, which I find hard to believe -- then there might be more legwork to this. And therefore, hey the decision may be done, but the contract still needs to be ironed out.\"[RELATED: Phillies fan participates in \"lent\" in hopes of recruiting Harper]Russell is being safe with the terminology he's using, which is understandable. And while we haven't been able to confirm these rumors, Harper, along with many other free agents, remains unsigned.The Giants appeared to be the \"mystery team\" that introduced themselves late into the Harper sweepstakes -- and when the radio hosts asked Russell his opinion on where the outfielder will end up next season, he believed Harper will be in an orange and black uniform.\"I don't think it's going to be the Nationals,\" Russell said. \"I think it's going to be the San Francisco Giants, but that is not by any means an 'I know that for a fact,' so I want to caution everybody -- I know how this works -- I get in trouble with everything I say on my radio show, and everyone blows it up.\" The wait continues ... \n"

Yahoo Sports' Charles Robinson and Amanda Borges address the settlement between the players and the NFL, and what it means for their continuing efforts to promote social activism.The NBA jerseys of the future have a new feature to them: the ability to customize them after purchase by changing the name and number.In an awkward reveal reminiscent of a tech presentation, NBA commissioner Adam Silver and sportscaster Ahmad Rashad demonstrated the jersey at the NBA Tech Summit on Friday ahead of All-Star Weekend in Charlotte, switching a No. 30 Stephen Curry jersey to No. 23 Michael Jordan threads.Adam Silver just revealed the NBA jersey of the future that changes the name and number 🤯(via @NBA)pic.twitter.com/cgJk7KcIIU— Yahoo Sports (@YahooSports) February 15, 2019If Silver is trying to pull a Steve Jobs, perhaps he should stick to his day job. But in all seriousness, the jersey presents some interesting questions: Will it be easier for fans to “bandwagon”? Can players switch jerseys mid-game? Will Drake be first in line for this new prop?Meanwhile, Twitter had all of the jokes.Jersey cost only 20 easy installments of, $999.99.— Vod Kanockers (@JHoward2716) February 15, 2019Kevin Durant can now switch teams mid game with these new #NBA jerseys 😳 pic.twitter.com/a01rMkiexr— OT Sports Podcast Network (@OTSportsPod) February 15, 2019This could go one of two ways: Either the NBA will have found another way to separate itself from the other sports leagues or it will be a pointless feature that exists just because there is the technology to make it happen and for Twitter to crack jokes. In any case, you have to admit the NBA never fails to entertain.More from Yahoo Sports: • Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight When spring training camps opened this week around Major League Baseball, it brought hope that maybe, finally, Bryce Harper and Manny Machado would sign with teams and baseball’s long free-agent freeze would melt away.Nope. Not yet. Not only has that not happened, something else did happen: a number of talented young players around the league have agreed to team-friendly contract extensions.The latest was New York Yankees ace Luis Severino, who on Friday reportedly agreed to a four-year, $40 million deal. The deal, first reported by Joel Sherman of the New York Post, would buy up Severino’s arbitration years and comes with a $15 million club option for his first year of free agency.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]By agreeing to this deal, the Yankees and Severino avoid arbitration for 2019. He’ll make $4 million this season, $10 million next, then $10.25 million in 2021 and $11 million in 2022. The club option is for 2023. In the grand scheme of society, this is a very generous contract. In baseball’s economic bubble, it’s another young player signing for below-market value relative to his skills and potential.It’s hard to blame Severino for taking the deal, looking around at a free-agent world where Harper and Machado are still available, as are Dallas Keuchel and Craig Kimbrel. Especially since we haven’t heard even slight grumblings about teams being interested in Keuchel and Kimbrel.Coming off a breakout season in which he went 19-8 with a 3.39 ERA, the 25-year-old Severino was given a deal that’s pretty hard to turn down: “Do you want $40 million guaranteed, yes or no?”The other players faced with a similar question this week were Philadelphia Phillies ace Aaron Nola, who said yes to a four-year, $45 million deal Wednesday. It also avoided arbitration and bought out two of Nola’s free agency years, making it the most below-market deal of any of these.The Minnesota Twins locked up two of their talented young players Thursday, as right fielder Max Kepler agreed to a five-year, $35 million deal with a $10 million club option for 2024. It buys out three years of free agency for Kepler, 26. Shortstop Jorge Polanco also agreed to a five-year extension, his is worth $25.75 million with two option years that could keep him in Minnesota through 2025.In a vacuum, these types of extensions look like win-wins: The players get guaranteed money as they’re coming off good seasons. The clubs get cost-certainty to help them navigate the future — whether it’s the Yankees and Phillies trying to add big free agents this year or next, or a team like the Twins striving for contention with a homegrown core.In a bigger sense, though, it’s hard not to look at these deals in the current state of free agency and wonder if they’re a symptom of something else. Is it the market correcting itself? Is it baseball’s economy morphing into something new? Or maybe it’s just players looking around and saying, “Well, I better get my money now.”According to numerous reports, there’s a fear that for this generation of young players the light at the end of the tunnel — the big free-agency payday — won’t be there for them in the same way it was for so many other players.So while it’s great that stars like Justin Verlander, Clayton Kershaw and Max Scherzer are publicly speaking out about the current state of free agency, they’re on the right side of it. They got their mega deals.The younger players find themselves in a different sort of peril. It’s entirely possible that these are the biggest paydays these players ever get, which is a much different economic model that we’ve seen from baseball in the past.Whether it’s right or wrong — and that’s certainly something that’s up for debate heading into the next collective-bargaining agreement — baseball’s economy has often been backward. Players get paid less, relative to the market, in their pre-free agency years. The best recent example is Mike Trout winning the MVP in 2014 at age 22 while making $1 million.He got a raise to $6 million the next season, but in 2015 was still making a fraction of what people like Ryan Howard ($25M), Albert Pujols ($24M), Joe Mauer ($23M), Mark Teixeira ($22.5M) and Jose Reyes ($22M) were making.But that overpay is a necessary part baseball’s economic ecosystem too. It’s a fact: Players get overpaid as their careers decline. It’s almost like baseball’s way of making up for underpaying players during their early years. It’s baseball’s golden parachute. What’s happening these days is fewer teams are accepting that overpay as part of the how the system works.In the past few years, arbitration salaries have gotten higher and higher, and teams have tried harder to lock up younger stars before free agency. It’s why we’ve see players like Madison Bumgarner, Chris Archer, Chris Sale and Paul Goldschmidt become valuable trade chips for their team-friendly contract extensions.Teams are getting smarter about where their money goes, and how to keep value in their assets. These extensions to Severino, Nola and the rest show that they’re willing to spend money, just in the way that they want.Earlier this week, former Miami Marlins president David Samson tweeted something in response to Justin Verlander, saying the “broken system” talk was wrong. Players and their agents, Samson said, needed to adjust to a “new reality.”He may be right about the new reality part. The monster paydays at the end of the free agency tunnel could be fading away. If Bryce Harper and Manny Machado can’t get them, who can?The new reality could be players seizing their money. Whenever they can.– – – – – –Mike Oz is a writer at Yahoo Sports.

However, Wainwright framed the situation with a little more urgency on Friday by expressing concerns that a day of reckoning could happen sooner than later.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]Speaking to InsideSTL.com’s Tim McKernan, Wainwright said it was inevitable that the players will go on strike unless major changes are made to help bridge the widening gap. But he’s also worried that frustrations could reach a boiling point during the season leading to some form of a revolt. Perhaps even a mid-season walkout.#STLCards pitcher Adam Wainwright on @TMASTL: “Unless something changes, there’s going to be a strike. 100%.

The target date we should all still be looking at is Dec. 1, 2021. That’s when the current collective bargaining agreement ends and the owners will be forced to come to the table.That doesn’t mean we should just dismiss Wainwright’s concerns about a 2019 strike.

But, he scored just three points in 24 minutes on the floor in the Pelicans' 118-88 loss to the Orlando Magic earlier this week.\"This is a bad situation,\" Barkley said. \"It's a bad look for the NBA. Because that kid can't go out there and give 100 per cent because he’s worried about getting hurt. The guy's the second-best player in the world and he's got three points? That's not a good look for the NBA.\"The Boston Celtics and New York Knicks, among others, are expected to explore dealing for Davis after the season. Barkley, however, said he believes the forward will eventually land in Los Angeles because of Paul's relationship with Lakers star LeBron James.Barkley tallied 22.1 points and 11.7 rebounds per game over his 16-year career. He retired in 2000 and was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame six years later.\n"

Yahoo Sports' Charles Robinson and Amanda Borges address the settlement between the players and the NFL, and what it means for their continuing efforts to promote social activism.The NBA jerseys of the future have a new feature to them: the ability to customize them after purchase by changing the name and number.In an awkward reveal reminiscent of a tech presentation, NBA commissioner Adam Silver and sportscaster Ahmad Rashad demonstrated the jersey at the NBA Tech Summit on Friday ahead of All-Star Weekend in Charlotte, switching a No. 30 Stephen Curry jersey to No. 23 Michael Jordan threads.Adam Silver just revealed the NBA jersey of the future that changes the name and number 🤯(via @NBA)pic.twitter.com/cgJk7KcIIU— Yahoo Sports (@YahooSports) February 15, 2019If Silver is trying to pull a Steve Jobs, perhaps he should stick to his day job. But in all seriousness, the jersey presents some interesting questions: Will it be easier for fans to “bandwagon”? Can players switch jerseys mid-game? Will Drake be first in line for this new prop?Meanwhile, Twitter had all of the jokes.Jersey cost only 20 easy installments of, $999.99.— Vod Kanockers (@JHoward2716) February 15, 2019Kevin Durant can now switch teams mid game with these new #NBA jerseys 😳 pic.twitter.com/a01rMkiexr— OT Sports Podcast Network (@OTSportsPod) February 15, 2019This could go one of two ways: Either the NBA will have found another way to separate itself from the other sports leagues or it will be a pointless feature that exists just because there is the technology to make it happen and for Twitter to crack jokes. In any case, you have to admit the NBA never fails to entertain.More from Yahoo Sports: • Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight When spring training camps opened this week around Major League Baseball, it brought hope that maybe, finally, Bryce Harper and Manny Machado would sign with teams and baseball’s long free-agent freeze would melt away.Nope. Not yet. Not only has that not happened, something else did happen: a number of talented young players around the league have agreed to team-friendly contract extensions.The latest was New York Yankees ace Luis Severino, who on Friday reportedly agreed to a four-year, $40 million deal. The deal, first reported by Joel Sherman of the New York Post, would buy up Severino’s arbitration years and comes with a $15 million club option for his first year of free agency.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]By agreeing to this deal, the Yankees and Severino avoid arbitration for 2019. He’ll make $4 million this season, $10 million next, then $10.25 million in 2021 and $11 million in 2022. The club option is for 2023. In the grand scheme of society, this is a very generous contract. In baseball’s economic bubble, it’s another young player signing for below-market value relative to his skills and potential.It’s hard to blame Severino for taking the deal, looking around at a free-agent world where Harper and Machado are still available, as are Dallas Keuchel and Craig Kimbrel. Especially since we haven’t heard even slight grumblings about teams being interested in Keuchel and Kimbrel.Coming off a breakout season in which he went 19-8 with a 3.39 ERA, the 25-year-old Severino was given a deal that’s pretty hard to turn down: “Do you want $40 million guaranteed, yes or no?”The other players faced with a similar question this week were Philadelphia Phillies ace Aaron Nola, who said yes to a four-year, $45 million deal Wednesday. It also avoided arbitration and bought out two of Nola’s free agency years, making it the most below-market deal of any of these.The Minnesota Twins locked up two of their talented young players Thursday, as right fielder Max Kepler agreed to a five-year, $35 million deal with a $10 million club option for 2024. It buys out three years of free agency for Kepler, 26. Shortstop Jorge Polanco also agreed to a five-year extension, his is worth $25.75 million with two option years that could keep him in Minnesota through 2025.In a vacuum, these types of extensions look like win-wins: The players get guaranteed money as they’re coming off good seasons. The clubs get cost-certainty to help them navigate the future — whether it’s the Yankees and Phillies trying to add big free agents this year or next, or a team like the Twins striving for contention with a homegrown core.In a bigger sense, though, it’s hard not to look at these deals in the current state of free agency and wonder if they’re a symptom of something else. Is it the market correcting itself? Is it baseball’s economy morphing into something new? Or maybe it’s just players looking around and saying, “Well, I better get my money now.”According to numerous reports, there’s a fear that for this generation of young players the light at the end of the tunnel — the big free-agency payday — won’t be there for them in the same way it was for so many other players.So while it’s great that stars like Justin Verlander, Clayton Kershaw and Max Scherzer are publicly speaking out about the current state of free agency, they’re on the right side of it. They got their mega deals.The younger players find themselves in a different sort of peril. It’s entirely possible that these are the biggest paydays these players ever get, which is a much different economic model that we’ve seen from baseball in the past.Whether it’s right or wrong — and that’s certainly something that’s up for debate heading into the next collective-bargaining agreement — baseball’s economy has often been backward. Players get paid less, relative to the market, in their pre-free agency years. The best recent example is Mike Trout winning the MVP in 2014 at age 22 while making $1 million.He got a raise to $6 million the next season, but in 2015 was still making a fraction of what people like Ryan Howard ($25M), Albert Pujols ($24M), Joe Mauer ($23M), Mark Teixeira ($22.5M) and Jose Reyes ($22M) were making.But that overpay is a necessary part baseball’s economic ecosystem too. It’s a fact: Players get overpaid as their careers decline. It’s almost like baseball’s way of making up for underpaying players during their early years. It’s baseball’s golden parachute. What’s happening these days is fewer teams are accepting that overpay as part of the how the system works.In the past few years, arbitration salaries have gotten higher and higher, and teams have tried harder to lock up younger stars before free agency. It’s why we’ve see players like Madison Bumgarner, Chris Archer, Chris Sale and Paul Goldschmidt become valuable trade chips for their team-friendly contract extensions.Teams are getting smarter about where their money goes, and how to keep value in their assets. These extensions to Severino, Nola and the rest show that they’re willing to spend money, just in the way that they want.Earlier this week, former Miami Marlins president David Samson tweeted something in response to Justin Verlander, saying the “broken system” talk was wrong. Players and their agents, Samson said, needed to adjust to a “new reality.”He may be right about the new reality part. The monster paydays at the end of the free agency tunnel could be fading away. If Bryce Harper and Manny Machado can’t get them, who can?The new reality could be players seizing their money. Whenever they can.– – – – – –Mike Oz is a writer at Yahoo Sports.

Follow @MikeOzMore from Yahoo Sports:• Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlightSt. Louis Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright became the latest player to forecast a “doom and gloom” outlook for Major League Baseball based on the growing financial and philosophical disconnect between the players and the owners.The sentiment that a strike will happen is one we’ve become accustomed to hearing from the players. However, Wainwright framed the situation with a little more urgency on Friday by expressing concerns that a day of reckoning could happen sooner than later.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]Speaking to InsideSTL.com’s Tim McKernan, Wainwright said it was inevitable that the players will go on strike unless major changes are made to help bridge the widening gap. But he’s also worried that frustrations could reach a boiling point during the season leading to some form of a revolt. Perhaps even a mid-season walkout.#STLCards pitcher Adam Wainwright on @TMASTL: “Unless something changes, there’s going to be a strike. 100%. I’m just worried people are going to walk-out mid-season.” pic.twitter.com/M8WeRVcASe— Tim McKernan (@tmckernan) February 15, 2019“Unless something changes, there’s going to be a strike. 100%,” Wainwright said regarding the free-agent freeze that has left stars like Bryce Harper and Manny Machado without contracts. “I’m just worried people are going to walkout midseason.”It’s conceivable given the current climate, but a players revolt on that level still feels like a long shot. The target date we should all still be looking at is Dec. 1, 2021. That’s when the current collective bargaining agreement ends and the owners will be forced to come to the table.That doesn’t mean we should just dismiss Wainwright’s concerns about a 2019 strike. While they might feel a little on the dramatic side, the frustration that has built all offseason as dozens of free agents, including and especially Harper and Machado, remain unsigned is becoming more palpable by the day. There’s a genuine feeling that owners are determined to cut back on salaries even as profits continue to reach new heights, it’s possible the players’ patience will run out if the free-agent freeze continues to drag on. Wainwright thinks so, and he’s far from alone.In Friday’s interview, the 37-year-old right-hander also criticized owners and front offense personnel for placing too much emphasis on “analytics” and placing everything in a “sabermetric box” that discounts intangibles and other immeasurable aspects of baseball.Adam Wainwright said today on ⁦@TMASTL⁩ that he expects there to be a strike “100%.”The context of the conversation comes from a discussion on how Bryce Harper and Manny Machado are still without teams.You can see Wainwright’s reasoning in the video below. pic.twitter.com/GXsmx4cXk1— Tim McKernan (@tmckernan) February 15, 2019Wainwright admitted that there’s always risk in making long-term financial commitments to players, but emphasized that doing so marks a commitment to winning that several teams seemingly lack.“Part of it is smart from their side of it, but you have to realize it’s about winning. So, if Bryce Harper wants 10 years and he’s 26 years old. He’s going to be a dynamic player. The same can be said about Manny Machado. These guys are superstar players.”The deeper we get into it the more obvious it is that the players know what battles lie ahead. The only real question is how much worse it will get before any progress is made toward a satisfactory resolution.More from Yahoo Sports:• Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight MLB rumors: Bryce Harper has made his decision, says D.C. radio host originally appeared on nbcsportsbayarea.comA report has come out from the East Coast saying Bryce Harper has come to a decision on which team he will play for in 2019 and beyond.Chris Russell, a sports radio talk show host from 106.7 The Fan in Washington D.C., (who has been on the Harper beat for some time) said the free agent slugger could make a decision in the next 24 hours.\"Maybe I took a little bit of a leap of faith here based on some indications I got from a real good source,\" Russell told 94WIP, in Philadelphia, on Friday.\"Bryce and his representatives, (Scott) Boras, his people, his wife Kayla, they've been meeting since Monday morning in Vegas. Bryce originally wanted this done, when it took this long, by Valentine's Day. Obviously, the contract has not been announced, signed, or whatever.\"\"But I'm led to believe by the people that I've talked to that are close to the situation -- and I have, again, a real good source that has helped me through this process, let's just leave it at that,\" Russell said. \"That Bryce was in a mood to celebrate yesterday. Now, the source said, 'I believe it's done.' I don't have concrete, 100 percent proof for you guys. I wish I did, otherwise, I would have it and I would be running around with it. But I don't have that, so I want to caution everybody in Philadelphia. But that's what I was led to believe, that this thing is now decided.\"Russell then mentioned the Phillies.\"Now, what comes then is hammering out a contract. And if we were to believe the report that the Philadelphia Phillies had not even extended a formal offer -- and I assume that to be a termed, written agreement, that type of thing, which I find hard to believe -- then there might be more legwork to this. And therefore, hey the decision may be done, but the contract still needs to be ironed out.\"[RELATED: Phillies fan participates in \"lent\" in hopes of recruiting Harper]Russell is being safe with the terminology he's using, which is understandable. And while we haven't been able to confirm these rumors, Harper, along with many other free agents, remains unsigned.The Giants appeared to be the \"mystery team\" that introduced themselves late into the Harper sweepstakes -- and when the radio hosts asked Russell his opinion on where the outfielder will end up next season, he believed Harper will be in an orange and black uniform.\"I don't think it's going to be the Nationals,\" Russell said. \"I think it's going to be the San Francisco Giants, but that is not by any means an 'I know that for a fact,' so I want to caution everybody -- I know how this works -- I get in trouble with everything I say on my radio show, and everyone blows it up.\" The wait continues ... Golden State Warriors stars Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant empathised with Steve Kerr after the head coach was ejected during the loss to the Portland Trail Blazers having thrown a clipboard in response to a flagrant foul call.Kerr was enraged late in the fourth quarter when Draymond Green was called for a flagrant foul after he stopped Zach Collins from approaching the rim as he went up for a shot.That drew Kerr's ire and after ranting in one referee's face, he slammed a clipboard down to earn an ejection, with Durant having to escort his head coach back off the court.The Warriors lost the game 129-107 but will still head into the All-Star break with the best record in the Western Conference.\"It was an emotional game. We fought really hard for 43 minutes,\" Curry told reporters afterwards.\"One questionable decision - the flagrant - obviously the fire came out. You see coach go and throw a clipboard. At that point you try to get us over the hump. An eight-point swing, it's tough to overcome.\"\"I looked at the replay and the amount of ball [Green] got, there was nothing excessive about it, he got all the ball.\"There was a lot of chirping, with Zach involved. There was probably a sensitivity to it, trying to put out some fires, but I thought it was a terrible call. We obviously paid the price for it with how everything unfolded after that.\"Durant shared that sympathy having been the one to pull Kerr away from the referees as he continued to rant at them.\"I felt for him, I understand his anger and his rage, especially for that call,\" he said.\"I thought we should have just kept playing, It was a common foul, I thought. Refs looked at it differently. \"I understand why coach was a little frustrated.\"Kerr explained that it was the disbelief at the call that had triggered his reaction.\"I was just shocked that that was called a flagrant foul,\" he said. \"I'm not sure how it's determined - if it's in New York or the officials on the call - but that was head-scratching: that that could be called a flagrant foul.\"The guy's going to go in for a dunk, you've got to make sure he doesn't dunk it.\"So, I told Kenny [Mauer] that I beg to differ. There might have been a couple of other words in there too!\"I'll have to ask the owner if the clipboard broke when I threw it down. I got a little anger out so that was good. I was too busy yelling to ask for an explanation.\"Charles Barkley thinks New Orleans Pelicans star Anthony Davis made a mistake with his trade request.The 25-year-old asked the Pelicans to move him in late January and the Los Angeles Lakers had been engaged in discussions about acquiring him. But, no deal was reached before the deadline and Davis remained with New Orleans.Barkley, an 11-time All-Star who works as an analyst for TNT, said he thinks Davis and his agent, Rich Paul, mishandled the situation.\"Don't ruin your reputation as a great player, one of the nicest guys in the world,\" Barkley told reporters on Thursday ahead of All-Star weekend (via the Washington Post).\"Remember, your agent works for you, you don't work for him. They handled that situation wrong. It's going to come back to bite them in the a***. It's unfortunate.\"The six-time All-Star entered play on Thursday averaging 28.5 points and 13.1 rebounds this season. But, he scored just three points in 24 minutes on the floor in the Pelicans' 118-88 loss to the Orlando Magic earlier this week.\"This is a bad situation,\" Barkley said. \"It's a bad look for the NBA. Because that kid can't go out there and give 100 per cent because he’s worried about getting hurt. The guy's the second-best player in the world and he's got three points? That's not a good look for the NBA.\"The Boston Celtics and New York Knicks, among others, are expected to explore dealing for Davis after the season. Barkley, however, said he believes the forward will eventually land in Los Angeles because of Paul's relationship with Lakers star LeBron James.Barkley tallied 22.1 points and 11.7 rebounds per game over his 16-year career. He retired in 2000 and was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame six years later.After an apology from Sergio Garcia, a non-apology from Matt Kuchar, and an uncooperative Mother Nature on Valentine's Day, it's time for everyone to focus again on Tiger Woods. Kidding. Sort of. A weather-delayed first round at Riviera re-starts on Friday morning and the 14-time major champ will be in the Hollywood-area spotlight as he finally begins his Genesis Open. And golf fans could potentially see a LOT of the tournament host as the event tries to play catch up after heavy rains on Thursday.Woods, Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas (Decent group, eh?) are scheduled to tee off at 8:32 local time (11:32 ET). The hope is they will complete their first rounds and then play as much of their second rounds as possible before darkness. And Tiger's hope is to finally win for the first time at this historic layout where he missed the cut last year. We'll be tracking Tiger every step of the way so keep it right here for the latest scores, news and highlights. (All times eastern)SATURDAY, 11:25: With a 25-foot birdie putt on No. 9, Woods' final hole of the second round, Tiger will likely make the cut. The birdie brought Woods back to even on his round and to one under overall.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096808527694245890After resuming play in the morning, Woods bogeyed his first hole, No. 4, then made four pars before his finishing birdie. His playing partners, however, fared much better. Justin Thomas shares the lead with Adam Scott at 11 under and Rory McIlroy birdied four of his six holes on Saturday morning to shoot 63 and move to seven under through 36 holes. Thursday's early wave is now on the course for their second rounds.-------------------FRIDAY-------------------8:25: And with that, the horn has sounded—play will be suspended for darkness on Friday at Riviera. Tiger, JT and Rory have six more holes to complete their second round. Justin Thomas is at 10-under, tied with Adam Scott for the lead. Tiger will hope Saturday brings some different momentum for him—as this marathon day ends with two bogeys in a row after the highlight eagle.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10965708926692065298:21: That's back-to-back bogeys now for Tiger Woods, dropping another shot here at the third hole (his 12th of the round). And over his past six holes, Tiger has four bogeys. The birdie at No. 1 helped negate most of that damage ... but Tiger's back to 1-under again—right on the current cut line.8:13: On his 30th hole of the day, Tiger is showing some obvious signs of being tired. And who could blame him—he's been playing golf for nearly 10 hours straight. From 165 yards out at the third hole, Tiger Woods tries to chop out a 6-iron and comes out of it. His ball comes to rest short of the green. With sunset in Pacific Palisades being 5:30 local time, this group will have time for maybe one more hole today.8:04: Tiger follows up that eagle putt at No. 1 with a bogey at the second hole. The third bogey of his second round moves Tiger back to 2-under overall.7:56: After a long wait at the second hole, Tiger sprays his second shot from 235 out with a fairway wood out to the right. He'll have his work cut out from the front right bunker to save par at the 482-yard par 4.7:40: This is exactly what Tiger Woods needed: He rolls in his 43-foot eagle putt at his 10th hole (the first) to get back to 3-under—negating those two bogeys he made on his front nine. What a putt! With the flagstick in!https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096570892669206529Tiger made a disappointing par to open his first round earlier today at the first hole. The unlikely eagle makes up for that effort—and could turn around Tiger's second round in a dramatic way. Tiger goes from toeing the cut line at 1-under to now all of a sudden being T-21.7:28: Tiger finds the fairway at the par-5 first hole, the group's 10th hole of their second round, as he attempts to get a shot back here after bogeying two of his final three holes on his front nine. Neither bogey was particularly bad—the 18th hole is playing brutally tough right now uphill and into the wind with the rain, making it even more of a challenging hole. And his break at 16 was very unlucky.7:16: Tiger and JT are gonna have their work cut out to save par at the 18th hole (their ninth). Each player had fairway wood approaches and tried playing a big cut. JT was way up left on the hill—Tiger was closer. He went high with his approach and will have about 11 feet left for par.Tiger misses the par putt, so he'll drop a shot along with JT as they make the turn. Tiger moves back to 1-under after 27 holes. That's where the cut line currently is—so all of a sudden, Tiger must be concerned about making the cut.7:01: Following Justin Thomas throwing a dart at the 17th to about 3 feet, Tiger puts his wedge shot from under 100 yards to outside 20 feet, so he'll be disappointed with that effort. The birdie putt misses on the high side, and Tiger taps in for par to remain at 2-under. His playing partner and buddy Justin Thomas stays hot, rolling in a fourth straight birdie to get to 9-under—tied for the lead with Adam Scott. Really impressive golf here from JT.6:54: The rain is really coming down now as the players head to the 17th hole. Tiger finds the fairway at the par-5 17th hole, but it was a short one—he has 326 yards left. Most players have been laying up at this par 5 all day.6:43: From a brutal position up against the back lip of the bunker, Tiger hacks it out—and somehow keeps the ball on the green, albeit the back portion. His par attempt from 44 feet away here comes up three feet shy. Tiger makes his bogey to move back to 2-under.Meanwhile, Justin Thomas is officially on fire. He has another birdie after a fabulous tee shot at 16. It's now two Kentucky boys tied at the top: Justin Thomas and J.B. Holmes (-8).https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10965576791939317766:39: Tiger will have serious lie issues at the par-3 16th hole. His tee shot came to rest up against the back lip of the bunker. As Billy Kratzert just remarked on PGA Tour Live, Tiger will do well just to keep this ball on the green. Though he avoided dropping a shot on his last hole, there might be a bogey in his future here.6:35: A clutchhh par save by Tiger at the 15th hole makes up for his poor chip—and Tiger keeps the momentum going on his second round, as he stays 3-under for the tournament and 2-under on the round.Justin Thomas, also in Tiger's group, holed out from in front of the green for birdie at the 14th hole, and he makes a long birdie putt at 15 to get to 7-under—just one back of fellow Kentucky native J.B. Holmes.6:32: A poor chip shot from Tiger at the 15th hole leaves him about 13 feet away. He'll need to convert that putt to prevent dropping his first shot of his second round.6:24: Tiger finds another fairway here at Riviera, this one at the 15th hole. The guy is feeeling it with his driver. Almost on auto pilot. His approach from 190 out turns a little too much, finding the rough to the left of the green. He'll have to get up and down to avoid dropping one here.6:20: From 20 feet out, Tiger's birdie bid comes up shy—never really scaring the hole, despite getting a good look at the line from Rory's putt. Tiger taps in for par to remain at 3-under.The putter has been disappointing for Tiger all day: He had 34 putts in his first round, including four three-putts, just the third time in his career he's done that.6:13: Tiger puts his tee shot at the par-3 14th hole just inside Rory's ball—about 20 feet right of the hole. He'll get a little teach from Rory's putt, too, as Tiger continues to hit it well today.6:07: Tiger just misses the left-to-right curling bid for birdie, leaving himself with an easy par at 13. He stays 3-under for the tournament and -2 through four on his round.Tiger's playing partners are also playing well—Rory has three birdies in his first four holes to get to 2-under. Look out for Rory at rainy Riviera. And Justin Thomas, despite hitting his tee shot out of bounds at 13, got up and down from 160 yards to avoid dropping multiple shots. He's now 5-under after that bogey.6:02: Another grooved tee shot for Tiger Woods at the 13th hole puts him in good position. He turned over his tee shot—putting his draw in the middle of the fairway at the dogleg left. Tiger spins his approach back to about 15 feet, just off the green in the fringe. He'll have a chance to knock another one here and keep the momentum going.5:51: Bang! Tiger nails the 25-footer for birdie at the 12th hole to add a second birdie to his card through three holes. Realistically, too, it could be three straight birdies for Tiger. But the 14-time major champion is now 2-under through 3—T-3 for the tournament (T-19)—and carries some strong momentum on his side at the start of his second round ... as the rain is coming down at Riviera.5:46: Tiger hits his approach hole high—about 25 feet from 181 yards. He'll have another chance to add a birdie to his third round.Tiger's currently at 2-under, which puts him at T-29. The projected cut is at 1-under—so he's comfortably inside the number as of now. But there's a ton of golf to be played, obviously.5:41: Tiger finds the fairway with his driver at the par-4 12th hole. The 12th usually plays as one of the toughest holes at Riviera—we'll see if Tiger can take advantage of his position here in the fairway.5:33: An excellent fairway-wood second shot by Tiger put him right in front of the par-5 11th green in two. But a very poor approach putt for his third leaves him more than 10 feet away. His birdie try slides by for a very disappointing par being so close in 2. That should've been a golden opportunity to start his second round with two birdies—instead, Tiger stays at 2-under.5:12: Tiger goes high with his pitch—having to navigate around the front bunker, and plays it nicely—spinning it about 7 feet short of the hole. So Tiger will have a good look for an opening birdie to start his second round. Tiger converts the birdie putt to move to 2-under.5:02: Only a little more than a half hour after finishing his first round, Tiger Woods (-1) -- along with Justin Thomas (-5) and Rory McIlroy (+1) -- has teed off in his second round. The group started on the drivable 10th hole, and Tiger has driven his tee shot just off the green. He'll have a chance to put his pitch shot close to start his second round with a birdie.4:24: Tiger narrowly misses the birdie putt at the 18th hole, so he'll tap in for a par and an opening-round, one-under 70 at Riviera. Having three-putted for a fourth time on the 17th hole to drop a shot in disappointing fashion, Tiger will head to his second round a bit frustrated. But the four consecutive birdies showed him being able to score well at Riviera, where he has never won.Tiger, JT (who birdied 18 to finish at 5-under) and Rory will head right back for their second round in this marathon day for them.4:18: Tiger responds to that shocking three-putt with a perfect drive and a towering 6-iron on Riviera's famed 18th. Woods is in good shape to at least make par the difficult hole, but as we've seen all day, a two-putt is anything but automatic.Here's an unusual stat on Tiger three-putting four times this afternoon. He's making some history in a bad way...https://twitter.com/JustinRayGolf/status/10965196250582507574:06: So much for the momentum. . . After a decent approach shot that spins back to about 20 feet, Woods runs his birdie putt a couple feet by and. . . gulp. . . misses the comebacker from about two feet. Wow. That's four three-putts on the day as Tiger falls back to one under with one hole to play.3:57: Uh-oh, it's raining in southern California again. Meanwhile, Woods is plodding his way up the par-5 17th. After pulling his drive into the left rough and drawing a poor lie, Woods pushed his layup slightly into the first cut of the right rough. He'll have a some sort of wedge to a back-right hole location.3:50: Tiger's tee shot was tracking on the par-3 16th, but it comes up about 30 feet short. From there, he two-putts for par to remain at two under. Justin Thomas makes his 10-foot birdie effort to move to four under, while Rory McIlroy remains at one over. McIlroy hast two holes to avert his first over-par score of 2019.3:40: After another great drive and a solid approach, Woods races his birdie attempt nearly five feet past the hole. But he keeps the overall positive momentum going by converting the par putt to remain at two under. Tiger has three more holes to play. At least, before he gets a lunch break.3:24: BANG! There's the bounce back from Tiger. It just came one hole later. And from farther away as Woods drains his 12-footer for birdie on No. 14.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096507996031467520Woods is now back to two under, five shots behind Jordan Spieth, who has to be pleased to still be in front by two despite these soft conditions.3:17: Tiger hits a great shot on the difficult par-3 14th hole to about 15 feet. He'll have a good look at birdie coming up. In the meantime, here's a look at how the leader board stands with Jordan Spieth still leading the way.Jordan Spieth (-7) 2t. Tony Finau (-5) 2t. Patrick Rodgers (-5) 2t. Kramer Hickok (-5) 2t. Davis Love III (-5) 2t. Adam Scott (-5) 2t. J.B. Homes (-5)Click here for full scores.3:13: Woods stuck his approach to about four feet below the hole on No. 13. A bounce back birdie looked like a forgone conclusion until he pushed his effort. Woof. That's two three-putts and two short misses on the greens for Tiger today. He remains at one under. Meanwhile, Rory McIlroy, after getting to two under through eight, has fallen to one over after back-to-back bogeys. Justin Thomas, the third player in the group, continues to lead this trio at three under.3:05: After hitting fade after fade, Woods steps to the 13th tee and rips a draw around the corner, perfectly setting up his next shot. Good to see him working it both ways with ease.3:01: Tiger pushed his tee shot into the right rough, then hit a fantastic recovery shot from a thick lie onto the green. He had a long look at birdie that rolled about four feet past, leaving him with a tricky left-to-right par putt, which he missed. That's three three putts on the day for Woods, and he's still one under.2:39: Not the best chip from Woods, as he left himself about six feet for birdie, but he makes it anyway. Four straight for Tiger to get to two under for the day.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10964952191957975042:30: Woods rips a 3-wood from 269 to just in front of the green. Hate to jinx him, but there's no reason he shouldn't easily make his fourth straight birdie here (ducks).2:20: Three in a row for Woods as he rolls in another at No. 10 and moves to one under. If he finds the fairway again at the 11th, four in a row will be in his sights. Meanwhile, Rory makes his par to stay at one under and JT ends up holing his 10 footer for birdie to get to four under. Finally a little bit of JUICE from this threesome.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096489287753711616https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096489787672780800By the way, it looks like we know when they'll be heading back out for round two later today. Here's an update from the Tiger Tracker:https://twitter.com/GCTigerTracker/status/1096481806067523585That should give them enough time to get at least 11 or 12 holes in.At the 11th, Woods stripes another drive down the fairway. He's really starting to cook.2:12: Tiger's shot was a tad more difficult than we thought, as he had to avoid a bunker and take it up high to get it back to the pin. He was successful, sticking it to about three feet. Hell of a shot. Even better was Rory's shot, as he flopped it from a nice lie and got it to hang on just off the back of the green and stay out of the back bunker. Thomas, who had the easiest shot, put too much spin on his chip, leaving himself with about 10 feet for birdie.2:07: Finally, Tiger, Rory and JT hit their tee shots, and it looks like the ensuing entertainment will be well worth the wait. Tiger is in the collection area left of the green, where he has a straightforward chip that should set him up with a good chance to make birdie. Thomas is just in front of the green, and he'll have a great chance to make a birdie as well. Rory ... um ... not so much. He's in the rough with a greenside bunker in front of him and a pin he won't be able to get close to, and just holding the green would be a miracle.1:52: Woods drains his four-footer for bird and turns in even par 35. Real strong finish to his opening nine, and now it looks like he'll have a long wait at the 10th. DeChambeau, Kuchar and Rahm have still yet to hit their tee shots.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10964831254067896321:47: Tiger had just 122 left to the green and stuck one in there close. He has four feet left for birdie to turn in even par, which would be a small victory after that ugly three putt back at No. 7. Not to mention he'll have a prime opportunity to get into red figures at the driveable par-4 10th.1:41: Woods cranks another high fade right down the middle with the driver at No. 9. With the tees up today, he'll have a low iron in his hand for his approach.1:34: And he's on the board! Woods bounces back with a birdie putt from 15 feet, getting him back to one over. We'll see if that gets him going before making the turn.1:30: From 125 yards out, Woods hit a wedge and hated it from the second he made contact. While he did pull it, he's still hole high and inside 20 feet. Hideki Matsuyama-esque move from Tiger.1:24: Woods rips one right down the middle at the par-4 eighth. Should have a short iron in.1:15: Tiger's birdie putt was actually from just off the green on the fringe, and he rolled it by some four feet. Then, he missed the comebacker for par, dropping to two over on the day. Oof.1:09: Fairway and a green for Woods at the seventh. Good look at birdie coming up to get back to level par.12:58: Another hole, another par for Woods, who two-putted from 24 feet on the par-3 sixth. In the group up ahead, though, Jon Rahm is making a move at three under through six.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/109646557828021452912:47: Another meh hole for Tiger on No. 5, just missing the fairway with his tee shot, finding the front of the green with a so-so approach, and two-putting for another par from 43 feet. Woods remains at one over through five holes while his playing partners, McIlroy and Thomas, both remain at one under.12:42: As Matt Kuchar's ball is in the air on the par-3 sixth, a fan yells, \"Go low—just not with the gratuity!\" Despite Matt maintaining this is \"not a story,\" it is. And this won't be the last comment like this.12:29: Woods hit a nice shot to about 15 feet on the par-3 fourth, but ran his birdie effort by the hole. Still one over. Still no highlights. At least, from Tiger. Here was Spieth's closing birdie from about an hour ago, because there is not much else exciting going on right now.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/109644546143346688112:17: Another missed fairway and another short approach from Tiger on the par-4 third. Although, Woods found the putting surface, he was unable to two-putt from 63 feet, missing a seven-footer for par after badly misreading his first putt. That drops Tiger to one over through three holes. Not a lot of highlights so far. . .12:02: Tiger misses right off the tee on No. 2 then comes up short on another approach. But his pitch shot nearly goes down, leaving him with a tap-in par. Even par through two holes.11:49: After that perfect opening tee shot, Tiger hit a hideous approach with a 5-iron that came up way short in a fairway bunker. From there, he hit his third to 10 feet but missed the putt to walk away with a disappointing par. Both of Tiger's playing partners, McIlroy and Thomas, make birdie.11:38: Matt Kuchar just misses his eagle attempt from 25 feet on No. 1, but taps in for birdie. Kuchar has been in the news a lot this week over a caddie controversy dating back to his win at the Mayakoba Golf Classic. A controversy he didn't help with his comments on Wednesday. Is it possible some of those \"Kuuuuch\" shouts will turn to \"Mooooch\"? Kinda sounded like it on the first hole. . .11:34: Jordan Spieth is in with a seven-under-par 64 to take the early lead. Spieth needed only 21 putts during his bogey-free round. Of course, starting tournaments hasn't been a problem for Spieth of late. Finishing, however, has been a different story. Incredibly, Spieth is looking for his first win since the 2017 British Open and his first top 5 since last year's Masters.11:32: Woods smashes a driver off the first tee that finds the fairway. The opening par 5 at Riviera is essentially a long par 4 and one of the easiest holes on the PGA Tour all year so Tiger is thinking at least birdie after that tee shot.10:53: So far, so good on the Friday weather:https://twitter.com/GCTigerTracker/status/1096437235262533632And with lift, clean and place in play (for at least the first round), low scores are out there. Let's set the over/under on the Par-71 layout at 68.5.10:45: We are approximately 45 minutes away from Tiger's tee time and it's another major champ who is already off to a fantastic start. Jordan Spieth has the lead at six under through 15 holes. Spieth leads Patrick Rodgers by one and then there's a big group at four under, including Bill Haas, who is playing in the event a year after being involved in a car accident during last year's tournament that killed a friend he was staying with. Make sure you read Brian Wacker's piece from earlier in the week on how Haas is still trying to move on from that tragedy.10:35: As we move within an hour from Tiger teeing off, check out GOLFTV's latest behind-the-scenes video with Woods in which he says his bag has up to 16(!) golf gloves during rainy rounds and he explains why he doesn't like wearing rain jackets:https://twitter.com/GOLFTV/status/1096246456795697153\"Pops used to say, 'Once you're wet, you're wet.

In any case, you have to admit the NBA never fails to entertain.More from Yahoo Sports: • Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight When spring training camps opened this week around Major League Baseball, it brought hope that maybe, finally, Bryce Harper and Manny Machado would sign with teams and baseball’s long free-agent freeze would melt away.Nope. Not yet. Not only has that not happened, something else did happen: a number of talented young players around the league have agreed to team-friendly contract extensions.The latest was New York Yankees ace Luis Severino, who on Friday reportedly agreed to a four-year, $40 million deal. The deal, first reported by Joel Sherman of the New York Post, would buy up Severino’s arbitration years and comes with a $15 million club option for his first year of free agency.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]By agreeing to this deal, the Yankees and Severino avoid arbitration for 2019. He’ll make $4 million this season, $10 million next, then $10.25 million in 2021 and $11 million in 2022. The club option is for 2023. In the grand scheme of society, this is a very generous contract. In baseball’s economic bubble, it’s another young player signing for below-market value relative to his skills and potential.It’s hard to blame Severino for taking the deal, looking around at a free-agent world where Harper and Machado are still available, as are Dallas Keuchel and Craig Kimbrel. Especially since we haven’t heard even slight grumblings about teams being interested in Keuchel and Kimbrel.Coming off a breakout season in which he went 19-8 with a 3.39 ERA, the 25-year-old Severino was given a deal that’s pretty hard to turn down: “Do you want $40 million guaranteed, yes or no?”The other players faced with a similar question this week were Philadelphia Phillies ace Aaron Nola, who said yes to a four-year, $45 million deal Wednesday. It also avoided arbitration and bought out two of Nola’s free agency years, making it the most below-market deal of any of these.The Minnesota Twins locked up two of their talented young players Thursday, as right fielder Max Kepler agreed to a five-year, $35 million deal with a $10 million club option for 2024. It buys out three years of free agency for Kepler, 26. Shortstop Jorge Polanco also agreed to a five-year extension, his is worth $25.75 million with two option years that could keep him in Minnesota through 2025.In a vacuum, these types of extensions look like win-wins: The players get guaranteed money as they’re coming off good seasons. The clubs get cost-certainty to help them navigate the future — whether it’s the Yankees and Phillies trying to add big free agents this year or next, or a team like the Twins striving for contention with a homegrown core.In a bigger sense, though, it’s hard not to look at these deals in the current state of free agency and wonder if they’re a symptom of something else. Is it the market correcting itself? Is it baseball’s economy morphing into something new? Or maybe it’s just players looking around and saying, “Well, I better get my money now.”According to numerous reports, there’s a fear that for this generation of young players the light at the end of the tunnel — the big free-agency payday — won’t be there for them in the same way it was for so many other players.So while it’s great that stars like Justin Verlander, Clayton Kershaw and Max Scherzer are publicly speaking out about the current state of free agency, they’re on the right side of it. They got their mega deals.The younger players find themselves in a different sort of peril. It’s entirely possible that these are the biggest paydays these players ever get, which is a much different economic model that we’ve seen from baseball in the past.Whether it’s right or wrong — and that’s certainly something that’s up for debate heading into the next collective-bargaining agreement — baseball’s economy has often been backward. Players get paid less, relative to the market, in their pre-free agency years. The best recent example is Mike Trout winning the MVP in 2014 at age 22 while making $1 million.He got a raise to $6 million the next season, but in 2015 was still making a fraction of what people like Ryan Howard ($25M), Albert Pujols ($24M), Joe Mauer ($23M), Mark Teixeira ($22.5M) and Jose Reyes ($22M) were making.But that overpay is a necessary part baseball’s economic ecosystem too. It’s a fact: Players get overpaid as their careers decline. It’s almost like baseball’s way of making up for underpaying players during their early years. It’s baseball’s golden parachute. What’s happening these days is fewer teams are accepting that overpay as part of the how the system works.In the past few years, arbitration salaries have gotten higher and higher, and teams have tried harder to lock up younger stars before free agency. It’s why we’ve see players like Madison Bumgarner, Chris Archer, Chris Sale and Paul Goldschmidt become valuable trade chips for their team-friendly contract extensions.Teams are getting smarter about where their money goes, and how to keep value in their assets. These extensions to Severino, Nola and the rest show that they’re willing to spend money, just in the way that they want.Earlier this week, former Miami Marlins president David Samson tweeted something in response to Justin Verlander, saying the “broken system” talk was wrong. Players and their agents, Samson said, needed to adjust to a “new reality.”He may be right about the new reality part. The monster paydays at the end of the free agency tunnel could be fading away. If Bryce Harper and Manny Machado can’t get them, who can?The new reality could be players seizing their money. Whenever they can.– – – – – –Mike Oz is a writer at Yahoo Sports.

However, Wainwright framed the situation with a little more urgency on Friday by expressing concerns that a day of reckoning could happen sooner than later.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]Speaking to InsideSTL.com’s Tim McKernan, Wainwright said it was inevitable that the players will go on strike unless major changes are made to help bridge the widening gap. But he’s also worried that frustrations could reach a boiling point during the season leading to some form of a revolt. Perhaps even a mid-season walkout.#STLCards pitcher Adam Wainwright on @TMASTL: “Unless something changes, there’s going to be a strike. 100%. I’m just worried people are going to walk-out mid-season.” pic.twitter.com/M8WeRVcASe— Tim McKernan (@tmckernan) February 15, 2019“Unless something changes, there’s going to be a strike. 100%,” Wainwright said regarding the free-agent freeze that has left stars like Bryce Harper and Manny Machado without contracts. “I’m just worried people are going to walkout midseason.”It’s conceivable given the current climate, but a players revolt on that level still feels like a long shot. The target date we should all still be looking at is Dec. 1, 2021. That’s when the current collective bargaining agreement ends and the owners will be forced to come to the table.That doesn’t mean we should just dismiss Wainwright’s concerns about a 2019 strike. While they might feel a little on the dramatic side, the frustration that has built all offseason as dozens of free agents, including and especially Harper and Machado, remain unsigned is becoming more palpable by the day. There’s a genuine feeling that owners are determined to cut back on salaries even as profits continue to reach new heights, it’s possible the players’ patience will run out if the free-agent freeze continues to drag on. Wainwright thinks so, and he’s far from alone.In Friday’s interview, the 37-year-old right-hander also criticized owners and front offense personnel for placing too much emphasis on “analytics” and placing everything in a “sabermetric box” that discounts intangibles and other immeasurable aspects of baseball.Adam Wainwright said today on ⁦@TMASTL⁩ that he expects there to be a strike “100%.”The context of the conversation comes from a discussion on how Bryce Harper and Manny Machado are still without teams.You can see Wainwright’s reasoning in the video below. pic.twitter.com/GXsmx4cXk1— Tim McKernan (@tmckernan) February 15, 2019Wainwright admitted that there’s always risk in making long-term financial commitments to players, but emphasized that doing so marks a commitment to winning that several teams seemingly lack.“Part of it is smart from their side of it, but you have to realize it’s about winning. So, if Bryce Harper wants 10 years and he’s 26 years old. He’s going to be a dynamic player. The same can be said about Manny Machado. These guys are superstar players.”The deeper we get into it the more obvious it is that the players know what battles lie ahead. The only real question is how much worse it will get before any progress is made toward a satisfactory resolution.More from Yahoo Sports:• Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight MLB rumors: Bryce Harper has made his decision, says D.C. radio host originally appeared on nbcsportsbayarea.comA report has come out from the East Coast saying Bryce Harper has come to a decision on which team he will play for in 2019 and beyond.Chris Russell, a sports radio talk show host from 106.7 The Fan in Washington D.C., (who has been on the Harper beat for some time) said the free agent slugger could make a decision in the next 24 hours.\"Maybe I took a little bit of a leap of faith here based on some indications I got from a real good source,\" Russell told 94WIP, in Philadelphia, on Friday.\"Bryce and his representatives, (Scott) Boras, his people, his wife Kayla, they've been meeting since Monday morning in Vegas. Bryce originally wanted this done, when it took this long, by Valentine's Day. Obviously, the contract has not been announced, signed, or whatever.\"\"But I'm led to believe by the people that I've talked to that are close to the situation -- and I have, again, a real good source that has helped me through this process, let's just leave it at that,\" Russell said. \"That Bryce was in a mood to celebrate yesterday. Now, the source said, 'I believe it's done.' I don't have concrete, 100 percent proof for you guys. I wish I did, otherwise, I would have it and I would be running around with it. But I don't have that, so I want to caution everybody in Philadelphia. But that's what I was led to believe, that this thing is now decided.\"Russell then mentioned the Phillies.\"Now, what comes then is hammering out a contract. And if we were to believe the report that the Philadelphia Phillies had not even extended a formal offer -- and I assume that to be a termed, written agreement, that type of thing, which I find hard to believe -- then there might be more legwork to this. And therefore, hey the decision may be done, but the contract still needs to be ironed out.\"[RELATED: Phillies fan participates in \"lent\" in hopes of recruiting Harper]Russell is being safe with the terminology he's using, which is understandable. And while we haven't been able to confirm these rumors, Harper, along with many other free agents, remains unsigned.The Giants appeared to be the \"mystery team\" that introduced themselves late into the Harper sweepstakes -- and when the radio hosts asked Russell his opinion on where the outfielder will end up next season, he believed Harper will be in an orange and black uniform.\"I don't think it's going to be the Nationals,\" Russell said. \"I think it's going to be the San Francisco Giants, but that is not by any means an 'I know that for a fact,' so I want to caution everybody -- I know how this works -- I get in trouble with everything I say on my radio show, and everyone blows it up.\" The wait continues ... Golden State Warriors stars Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant empathised with Steve Kerr after the head coach was ejected during the loss to the Portland Trail Blazers having thrown a clipboard in response to a flagrant foul call.Kerr was enraged late in the fourth quarter when Draymond Green was called for a flagrant foul after he stopped Zach Collins from approaching the rim as he went up for a shot.That drew Kerr's ire and after ranting in one referee's face, he slammed a clipboard down to earn an ejection, with Durant having to escort his head coach back off the court.The Warriors lost the game 129-107 but will still head into the All-Star break with the best record in the Western Conference.\"It was an emotional game. We fought really hard for 43 minutes,\" Curry told reporters afterwards.\"One questionable decision - the flagrant - obviously the fire came out. You see coach go and throw a clipboard. At that point you try to get us over the hump. An eight-point swing, it's tough to overcome.\"\"I looked at the replay and the amount of ball [Green] got, there was nothing excessive about it, he got all the ball.\"There was a lot of chirping, with Zach involved. There was probably a sensitivity to it, trying to put out some fires, but I thought it was a terrible call. We obviously paid the price for it with how everything unfolded after that.\"Durant shared that sympathy having been the one to pull Kerr away from the referees as he continued to rant at them.\"I felt for him, I understand his anger and his rage, especially for that call,\" he said.\"I thought we should have just kept playing, It was a common foul, I thought. Refs looked at it differently. \"I understand why coach was a little frustrated.\"Kerr explained that it was the disbelief at the call that had triggered his reaction.\"I was just shocked that that was called a flagrant foul,\" he said. \"I'm not sure how it's determined - if it's in New York or the officials on the call - but that was head-scratching: that that could be called a flagrant foul.\"The guy's going to go in for a dunk, you've got to make sure he doesn't dunk it.\"So, I told Kenny [Mauer] that I beg to differ. There might have been a couple of other words in there too!\"I'll have to ask the owner if the clipboard broke when I threw it down. I got a little anger out so that was good. I was too busy yelling to ask for an explanation.\"Charles Barkley thinks New Orleans Pelicans star Anthony Davis made a mistake with his trade request.The 25-year-old asked the Pelicans to move him in late January and the Los Angeles Lakers had been engaged in discussions about acquiring him. But, no deal was reached before the deadline and Davis remained with New Orleans.Barkley, an 11-time All-Star who works as an analyst for TNT, said he thinks Davis and his agent, Rich Paul, mishandled the situation.\"Don't ruin your reputation as a great player, one of the nicest guys in the world,\" Barkley told reporters on Thursday ahead of All-Star weekend (via the Washington Post).\"Remember, your agent works for you, you don't work for him. They handled that situation wrong. It's going to come back to bite them in the a***. It's unfortunate.\"The six-time All-Star entered play on Thursday averaging 28.5 points and 13.1 rebounds this season. But, he scored just three points in 24 minutes on the floor in the Pelicans' 118-88 loss to the Orlando Magic earlier this week.\"This is a bad situation,\" Barkley said. \"It's a bad look for the NBA. Because that kid can't go out there and give 100 per cent because he’s worried about getting hurt. The guy's the second-best player in the world and he's got three points? That's not a good look for the NBA.\"The Boston Celtics and New York Knicks, among others, are expected to explore dealing for Davis after the season. Barkley, however, said he believes the forward will eventually land in Los Angeles because of Paul's relationship with Lakers star LeBron James.Barkley tallied 22.1 points and 11.7 rebounds per game over his 16-year career. He retired in 2000 and was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame six years later.After an apology from Sergio Garcia, a non-apology from Matt Kuchar, and an uncooperative Mother Nature on Valentine's Day, it's time for everyone to focus again on Tiger Woods. Kidding. Sort of. A weather-delayed first round at Riviera re-starts on Friday morning and the 14-time major champ will be in the Hollywood-area spotlight as he finally begins his Genesis Open. And golf fans could potentially see a LOT of the tournament host as the event tries to play catch up after heavy rains on Thursday.Woods, Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas (Decent group, eh?) are scheduled to tee off at 8:32 local time (11:32 ET). The hope is they will complete their first rounds and then play as much of their second rounds as possible before darkness. And Tiger's hope is to finally win for the first time at this historic layout where he missed the cut last year. We'll be tracking Tiger every step of the way so keep it right here for the latest scores, news and highlights. (All times eastern)SATURDAY, 11:25: With a 25-foot birdie putt on No. 9, Woods' final hole of the second round, Tiger will likely make the cut. The birdie brought Woods back to even on his round and to one under overall.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096808527694245890After resuming play in the morning, Woods bogeyed his first hole, No. 4, then made four pars before his finishing birdie. His playing partners, however, fared much better. Justin Thomas shares the lead with Adam Scott at 11 under and Rory McIlroy birdied four of his six holes on Saturday morning to shoot 63 and move to seven under through 36 holes. Thursday's early wave is now on the course for their second rounds.-------------------FRIDAY-------------------8:25: And with that, the horn has sounded—play will be suspended for darkness on Friday at Riviera. Tiger, JT and Rory have six more holes to complete their second round. Justin Thomas is at 10-under, tied with Adam Scott for the lead. Tiger will hope Saturday brings some different momentum for him—as this marathon day ends with two bogeys in a row after the highlight eagle.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10965708926692065298:21: That's back-to-back bogeys now for Tiger Woods, dropping another shot here at the third hole (his 12th of the round). And over his past six holes, Tiger has four bogeys. The birdie at No. 1 helped negate most of that damage ... but Tiger's back to 1-under again—right on the current cut line.8:13: On his 30th hole of the day, Tiger is showing some obvious signs of being tired. And who could blame him—he's been playing golf for nearly 10 hours straight. From 165 yards out at the third hole, Tiger Woods tries to chop out a 6-iron and comes out of it. His ball comes to rest short of the green. With sunset in Pacific Palisades being 5:30 local time, this group will have time for maybe one more hole today.8:04: Tiger follows up that eagle putt at No. 1 with a bogey at the second hole. The third bogey of his second round moves Tiger back to 2-under overall.7:56: After a long wait at the second hole, Tiger sprays his second shot from 235 out with a fairway wood out to the right. He'll have his work cut out from the front right bunker to save par at the 482-yard par 4.7:40: This is exactly what Tiger Woods needed: He rolls in his 43-foot eagle putt at his 10th hole (the first) to get back to 3-under—negating those two bogeys he made on his front nine. What a putt! With the flagstick in!https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096570892669206529Tiger made a disappointing par to open his first round earlier today at the first hole. The unlikely eagle makes up for that effort—and could turn around Tiger's second round in a dramatic way. Tiger goes from toeing the cut line at 1-under to now all of a sudden being T-21.7:28: Tiger finds the fairway at the par-5 first hole, the group's 10th hole of their second round, as he attempts to get a shot back here after bogeying two of his final three holes on his front nine. Neither bogey was particularly bad—the 18th hole is playing brutally tough right now uphill and into the wind with the rain, making it even more of a challenging hole. And his break at 16 was very unlucky.7:16: Tiger and JT are gonna have their work cut out to save par at the 18th hole (their ninth). Each player had fairway wood approaches and tried playing a big cut. JT was way up left on the hill—Tiger was closer. He went high with his approach and will have about 11 feet left for par.Tiger misses the par putt, so he'll drop a shot along with JT as they make the turn. Tiger moves back to 1-under after 27 holes. That's where the cut line currently is—so all of a sudden, Tiger must be concerned about making the cut.7:01: Following Justin Thomas throwing a dart at the 17th to about 3 feet, Tiger puts his wedge shot from under 100 yards to outside 20 feet, so he'll be disappointed with that effort. The birdie putt misses on the high side, and Tiger taps in for par to remain at 2-under. His playing partner and buddy Justin Thomas stays hot, rolling in a fourth straight birdie to get to 9-under—tied for the lead with Adam Scott. Really impressive golf here from JT.6:54: The rain is really coming down now as the players head to the 17th hole. Tiger finds the fairway at the par-5 17th hole, but it was a short one—he has 326 yards left. Most players have been laying up at this par 5 all day.6:43: From a brutal position up against the back lip of the bunker, Tiger hacks it out—and somehow keeps the ball on the green, albeit the back portion. His par attempt from 44 feet away here comes up three feet shy. Tiger makes his bogey to move back to 2-under.Meanwhile, Justin Thomas is officially on fire. He has another birdie after a fabulous tee shot at 16. It's now two Kentucky boys tied at the top: Justin Thomas and J.B. Holmes (-8).https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10965576791939317766:39: Tiger will have serious lie issues at the par-3 16th hole. His tee shot came to rest up against the back lip of the bunker. As Billy Kratzert just remarked on PGA Tour Live, Tiger will do well just to keep this ball on the green. Though he avoided dropping a shot on his last hole, there might be a bogey in his future here.6:35: A clutchhh par save by Tiger at the 15th hole makes up for his poor chip—and Tiger keeps the momentum going on his second round, as he stays 3-under for the tournament and 2-under on the round.Justin Thomas, also in Tiger's group, holed out from in front of the green for birdie at the 14th hole, and he makes a long birdie putt at 15 to get to 7-under—just one back of fellow Kentucky native J.B. Holmes.6:32: A poor chip shot from Tiger at the 15th hole leaves him about 13 feet away. He'll need to convert that putt to prevent dropping his first shot of his second round.6:24: Tiger finds another fairway here at Riviera, this one at the 15th hole. The guy is feeeling it with his driver. Almost on auto pilot. His approach from 190 out turns a little too much, finding the rough to the left of the green. He'll have to get up and down to avoid dropping one here.6:20: From 20 feet out, Tiger's birdie bid comes up shy—never really scaring the hole, despite getting a good look at the line from Rory's putt. Tiger taps in for par to remain at 3-under.The putter has been disappointing for Tiger all day: He had 34 putts in his first round, including four three-putts, just the third time in his career he's done that.6:13: Tiger puts his tee shot at the par-3 14th hole just inside Rory's ball—about 20 feet right of the hole. He'll get a little teach from Rory's putt, too, as Tiger continues to hit it well today.6:07: Tiger just misses the left-to-right curling bid for birdie, leaving himself with an easy par at 13. He stays 3-under for the tournament and -2 through four on his round.Tiger's playing partners are also playing well—Rory has three birdies in his first four holes to get to 2-under. Look out for Rory at rainy Riviera. And Justin Thomas, despite hitting his tee shot out of bounds at 13, got up and down from 160 yards to avoid dropping multiple shots. He's now 5-under after that bogey.6:02: Another grooved tee shot for Tiger Woods at the 13th hole puts him in good position. He turned over his tee shot—putting his draw in the middle of the fairway at the dogleg left. Tiger spins his approach back to about 15 feet, just off the green in the fringe. He'll have a chance to knock another one here and keep the momentum going.5:51: Bang! Tiger nails the 25-footer for birdie at the 12th hole to add a second birdie to his card through three holes. Realistically, too, it could be three straight birdies for Tiger. But the 14-time major champion is now 2-under through 3—T-3 for the tournament (T-19)—and carries some strong momentum on his side at the start of his second round ... as the rain is coming down at Riviera.5:46: Tiger hits his approach hole high—about 25 feet from 181 yards. He'll have another chance to add a birdie to his third round.Tiger's currently at 2-under, which puts him at T-29. The projected cut is at 1-under—so he's comfortably inside the number as of now. But there's a ton of golf to be played, obviously.5:41: Tiger finds the fairway with his driver at the par-4 12th hole. The 12th usually plays as one of the toughest holes at Riviera—we'll see if Tiger can take advantage of his position here in the fairway.5:33: An excellent fairway-wood second shot by Tiger put him right in front of the par-5 11th green in two. But a very poor approach putt for his third leaves him more than 10 feet away. His birdie try slides by for a very disappointing par being so close in 2. That should've been a golden opportunity to start his second round with two birdies—instead, Tiger stays at 2-under.5:12: Tiger goes high with his pitch—having to navigate around the front bunker, and plays it nicely—spinning it about 7 feet short of the hole. So Tiger will have a good look for an opening birdie to start his second round. Tiger converts the birdie putt to move to 2-under.5:02: Only a little more than a half hour after finishing his first round, Tiger Woods (-1) -- along with Justin Thomas (-5) and Rory McIlroy (+1) -- has teed off in his second round. The group started on the drivable 10th hole, and Tiger has driven his tee shot just off the green. He'll have a chance to put his pitch shot close to start his second round with a birdie.4:24: Tiger narrowly misses the birdie putt at the 18th hole, so he'll tap in for a par and an opening-round, one-under 70 at Riviera. Having three-putted for a fourth time on the 17th hole to drop a shot in disappointing fashion, Tiger will head to his second round a bit frustrated. But the four consecutive birdies showed him being able to score well at Riviera, where he has never won.Tiger, JT (who birdied 18 to finish at 5-under) and Rory will head right back for their second round in this marathon day for them.4:18: Tiger responds to that shocking three-putt with a perfect drive and a towering 6-iron on Riviera's famed 18th. Woods is in good shape to at least make par the difficult hole, but as we've seen all day, a two-putt is anything but automatic.Here's an unusual stat on Tiger three-putting four times this afternoon. He's making some history in a bad way...https://twitter.com/JustinRayGolf/status/10965196250582507574:06: So much for the momentum. . . After a decent approach shot that spins back to about 20 feet, Woods runs his birdie putt a couple feet by and. . . gulp. . . misses the comebacker from about two feet. Wow. That's four three-putts on the day as Tiger falls back to one under with one hole to play.3:57: Uh-oh, it's raining in southern California again. Meanwhile, Woods is plodding his way up the par-5 17th. After pulling his drive into the left rough and drawing a poor lie, Woods pushed his layup slightly into the first cut of the right rough. He'll have a some sort of wedge to a back-right hole location.3:50: Tiger's tee shot was tracking on the par-3 16th, but it comes up about 30 feet short. From there, he two-putts for par to remain at two under. Justin Thomas makes his 10-foot birdie effort to move to four under, while Rory McIlroy remains at one over. McIlroy hast two holes to avert his first over-par score of 2019.3:40: After another great drive and a solid approach, Woods races his birdie attempt nearly five feet past the hole. But he keeps the overall positive momentum going by converting the par putt to remain at two under. Tiger has three more holes to play. At least, before he gets a lunch break.3:24: BANG! There's the bounce back from Tiger. It just came one hole later. And from farther away as Woods drains his 12-footer for birdie on No. 14.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096507996031467520Woods is now back to two under, five shots behind Jordan Spieth, who has to be pleased to still be in front by two despite these soft conditions.3:17: Tiger hits a great shot on the difficult par-3 14th hole to about 15 feet. He'll have a good look at birdie coming up. In the meantime, here's a look at how the leader board stands with Jordan Spieth still leading the way.Jordan Spieth (-7) 2t. Tony Finau (-5) 2t. Patrick Rodgers (-5) 2t. Kramer Hickok (-5) 2t. Davis Love III (-5) 2t. Adam Scott (-5) 2t. J.B. Homes (-5)Click here for full scores.3:13: Woods stuck his approach to about four feet below the hole on No. 13. A bounce back birdie looked like a forgone conclusion until he pushed his effort. Woof. That's two three-putts and two short misses on the greens for Tiger today. He remains at one under. Meanwhile, Rory McIlroy, after getting to two under through eight, has fallen to one over after back-to-back bogeys. Justin Thomas, the third player in the group, continues to lead this trio at three under.3:05: After hitting fade after fade, Woods steps to the 13th tee and rips a draw around the corner, perfectly setting up his next shot. Good to see him working it both ways with ease.3:01: Tiger pushed his tee shot into the right rough, then hit a fantastic recovery shot from a thick lie onto the green. He had a long look at birdie that rolled about four feet past, leaving him with a tricky left-to-right par putt, which he missed. That's three three putts on the day for Woods, and he's still one under.2:39: Not the best chip from Woods, as he left himself about six feet for birdie, but he makes it anyway. Four straight for Tiger to get to two under for the day.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10964952191957975042:30: Woods rips a 3-wood from 269 to just in front of the green. Hate to jinx him, but there's no reason he shouldn't easily make his fourth straight birdie here (ducks).2:20: Three in a row for Woods as he rolls in another at No. 10 and moves to one under. If he finds the fairway again at the 11th, four in a row will be in his sights. Meanwhile, Rory makes his par to stay at one under and JT ends up holing his 10 footer for birdie to get to four under. Finally a little bit of JUICE from this threesome.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096489287753711616https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096489787672780800By the way, it looks like we know when they'll be heading back out for round two later today. Here's an update from the Tiger Tracker:https://twitter.com/GCTigerTracker/status/1096481806067523585That should give them enough time to get at least 11 or 12 holes in.At the 11th, Woods stripes another drive down the fairway. He's really starting to cook.2:12: Tiger's shot was a tad more difficult than we thought, as he had to avoid a bunker and take it up high to get it back to the pin. He was successful, sticking it to about three feet. Hell of a shot. Even better was Rory's shot, as he flopped it from a nice lie and got it to hang on just off the back of the green and stay out of the back bunker. Thomas, who had the easiest shot, put too much spin on his chip, leaving himself with about 10 feet for birdie.2:07: Finally, Tiger, Rory and JT hit their tee shots, and it looks like the ensuing entertainment will be well worth the wait. Tiger is in the collection area left of the green, where he has a straightforward chip that should set him up with a good chance to make birdie. Thomas is just in front of the green, and he'll have a great chance to make a birdie as well. Rory ... um ... not so much. He's in the rough with a greenside bunker in front of him and a pin he won't be able to get close to, and just holding the green would be a miracle.1:52: Woods drains his four-footer for bird and turns in even par 35. Real strong finish to his opening nine, and now it looks like he'll have a long wait at the 10th. DeChambeau, Kuchar and Rahm have still yet to hit their tee shots.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10964831254067896321:47: Tiger had just 122 left to the green and stuck one in there close. He has four feet left for birdie to turn in even par, which would be a small victory after that ugly three putt back at No. 7. Not to mention he'll have a prime opportunity to get into red figures at the driveable par-4 10th.1:41: Woods cranks another high fade right down the middle with the driver at No. 9. With the tees up today, he'll have a low iron in his hand for his approach.1:34: And he's on the board! Woods bounces back with a birdie putt from 15 feet, getting him back to one over. We'll see if that gets him going before making the turn.1:30: From 125 yards out, Woods hit a wedge and hated it from the second he made contact. While he did pull it, he's still hole high and inside 20 feet. Hideki Matsuyama-esque move from Tiger.1:24: Woods rips one right down the middle at the par-4 eighth. Should have a short iron in.1:15: Tiger's birdie putt was actually from just off the green on the fringe, and he rolled it by some four feet. Then, he missed the comebacker for par, dropping to two over on the day. Oof.1:09: Fairway and a green for Woods at the seventh. Good look at birdie coming up to get back to level par.12:58: Another hole, another par for Woods, who two-putted from 24 feet on the par-3 sixth. In the group up ahead, though, Jon Rahm is making a move at three under through six.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/109646557828021452912:47: Another meh hole for Tiger on No. 5, just missing the fairway with his tee shot, finding the front of the green with a so-so approach, and two-putting for another par from 43 feet. Woods remains at one over through five holes while his playing partners, McIlroy and Thomas, both remain at one under.12:42: As Matt Kuchar's ball is in the air on the par-3 sixth, a fan yells, \"Go low—just not with the gratuity!\" Despite Matt maintaining this is \"not a story,\" it is. And this won't be the last comment like this.12:29: Woods hit a nice shot to about 15 feet on the par-3 fourth, but ran his birdie effort by the hole. Still one over. Still no highlights. At least, from Tiger. Here was Spieth's closing birdie from about an hour ago, because there is not much else exciting going on right now.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/109644546143346688112:17: Another missed fairway and another short approach from Tiger on the par-4 third. Although, Woods found the putting surface, he was unable to two-putt from 63 feet, missing a seven-footer for par after badly misreading his first putt. That drops Tiger to one over through three holes. Not a lot of highlights so far. . .12:02: Tiger misses right off the tee on No. 2 then comes up short on another approach. But his pitch shot nearly goes down, leaving him with a tap-in par. Even par through two holes.11:49: After that perfect opening tee shot, Tiger hit a hideous approach with a 5-iron that came up way short in a fairway bunker. From there, he hit his third to 10 feet but missed the putt to walk away with a disappointing par. Both of Tiger's playing partners, McIlroy and Thomas, make birdie.11:38: Matt Kuchar just misses his eagle attempt from 25 feet on No. 1, but taps in for birdie. Kuchar has been in the news a lot this week over a caddie controversy dating back to his win at the Mayakoba Golf Classic. A controversy he didn't help with his comments on Wednesday. Is it possible some of those \"Kuuuuch\" shouts will turn to \"Mooooch\"? Kinda sounded like it on the first hole. . .11:34: Jordan Spieth is in with a seven-under-par 64 to take the early lead. Spieth needed only 21 putts during his bogey-free round. Of course, starting tournaments hasn't been a problem for Spieth of late. Finishing, however, has been a different story. Incredibly, Spieth is looking for his first win since the 2017 British Open and his first top 5 since last year's Masters.11:32: Woods smashes a driver off the first tee that finds the fairway. The opening par 5 at Riviera is essentially a long par 4 and one of the easiest holes on the PGA Tour all year so Tiger is thinking at least birdie after that tee shot.10:53: So far, so good on the Friday weather:https://twitter.com/GCTigerTracker/status/1096437235262533632And with lift, clean and place in play (for at least the first round), low scores are out there. Let's set the over/under on the Par-71 layout at 68.5.10:45: We are approximately 45 minutes away from Tiger's tee time and it's another major champ who is already off to a fantastic start. Jordan Spieth has the lead at six under through 15 holes. Spieth leads Patrick Rodgers by one and then there's a big group at four under, including Bill Haas, who is playing in the event a year after being involved in a car accident during last year's tournament that killed a friend he was staying with. Make sure you read Brian Wacker's piece from earlier in the week on how Haas is still trying to move on from that tragedy.10:35: As we move within an hour from Tiger teeing off, check out GOLFTV's latest behind-the-scenes video with Woods in which he says his bag has up to 16(!) golf gloves during rainy rounds and he explains why he doesn't like wearing rain jackets:https://twitter.com/GOLFTV/status/1096246456795697153\"Pops used to say, 'Once you're wet, you're wet.

In any case, you have to admit the NBA never fails to entertain.More from Yahoo Sports: • Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight When spring training camps opened this week around Major League Baseball, it brought hope that maybe, finally, Bryce Harper and Manny Machado would sign with teams and baseball’s long free-agent freeze would melt away.Nope. Not yet. Not only has that not happened, something else did happen: a number of talented young players around the league have agreed to team-friendly contract extensions.The latest was New York Yankees ace Luis Severino, who on Friday reportedly agreed to a four-year, $40 million deal. The deal, first reported by Joel Sherman of the New York Post, would buy up Severino’s arbitration years and comes with a $15 million club option for his first year of free agency.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]By agreeing to this deal, the Yankees and Severino avoid arbitration for 2019. He’ll make $4 million this season, $10 million next, then $10.25 million in 2021 and $11 million in 2022. The club option is for 2023. In the grand scheme of society, this is a very generous contract. In baseball’s economic bubble, it’s another young player signing for below-market value relative to his skills and potential.It’s hard to blame Severino for taking the deal, looking around at a free-agent world where Harper and Machado are still available, as are Dallas Keuchel and Craig Kimbrel. Especially since we haven’t heard even slight grumblings about teams being interested in Keuchel and Kimbrel.Coming off a breakout season in which he went 19-8 with a 3.39 ERA, the 25-year-old Severino was given a deal that’s pretty hard to turn down: “Do you want $40 million guaranteed, yes or no?”The other players faced with a similar question this week were Philadelphia Phillies ace Aaron Nola, who said yes to a four-year, $45 million deal Wednesday. It also avoided arbitration and bought out two of Nola’s free agency years, making it the most below-market deal of any of these.The Minnesota Twins locked up two of their talented young players Thursday, as right fielder Max Kepler agreed to a five-year, $35 million deal with a $10 million club option for 2024. It buys out three years of free agency for Kepler, 26. Shortstop Jorge Polanco also agreed to a five-year extension, his is worth $25.75 million with two option years that could keep him in Minnesota through 2025.In a vacuum, these types of extensions look like win-wins: The players get guaranteed money as they’re coming off good seasons. The clubs get cost-certainty to help them navigate the future — whether it’s the Yankees and Phillies trying to add big free agents this year or next, or a team like the Twins striving for contention with a homegrown core.In a bigger sense, though, it’s hard not to look at these deals in the current state of free agency and wonder if they’re a symptom of something else. Is it the market correcting itself? Is it baseball’s economy morphing into something new? Or maybe it’s just players looking around and saying, “Well, I better get my money now.”According to numerous reports, there’s a fear that for this generation of young players the light at the end of the tunnel — the big free-agency payday — won’t be there for them in the same way it was for so many other players.So while it’s great that stars like Justin Verlander, Clayton Kershaw and Max Scherzer are publicly speaking out about the current state of free agency, they’re on the right side of it. They got their mega deals.The younger players find themselves in a different sort of peril. It’s entirely possible that these are the biggest paydays these players ever get, which is a much different economic model that we’ve seen from baseball in the past.Whether it’s right or wrong — and that’s certainly something that’s up for debate heading into the next collective-bargaining agreement — baseball’s economy has often been backward. Players get paid less, relative to the market, in their pre-free agency years. The best recent example is Mike Trout winning the MVP in 2014 at age 22 while making $1 million.He got a raise to $6 million the next season, but in 2015 was still making a fraction of what people like Ryan Howard ($25M), Albert Pujols ($24M), Joe Mauer ($23M), Mark Teixeira ($22.5M) and Jose Reyes ($22M) were making.But that overpay is a necessary part baseball’s economic ecosystem too. It’s a fact: Players get overpaid as their careers decline. It’s almost like baseball’s way of making up for underpaying players during their early years. It’s baseball’s golden parachute. What’s happening these days is fewer teams are accepting that overpay as part of the how the system works.In the past few years, arbitration salaries have gotten higher and higher, and teams have tried harder to lock up younger stars before free agency. It’s why we’ve see players like Madison Bumgarner, Chris Archer, Chris Sale and Paul Goldschmidt become valuable trade chips for their team-friendly contract extensions.Teams are getting smarter about where their money goes, and how to keep value in their assets. These extensions to Severino, Nola and the rest show that they’re willing to spend money, just in the way that they want.Earlier this week, former Miami Marlins president David Samson tweeted something in response to Justin Verlander, saying the “broken system” talk was wrong. Players and their agents, Samson said, needed to adjust to a “new reality.”He may be right about the new reality part. The monster paydays at the end of the free agency tunnel could be fading away. If Bryce Harper and Manny Machado can’t get them, who can?The new reality could be players seizing their money. Whenever they can.– – – – – –Mike Oz is a writer at Yahoo Sports.

Follow @MikeOzMore from Yahoo Sports:• Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlightSt. Louis Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright became the latest player to forecast a “doom and gloom” outlook for Major League Baseball based on the growing financial and philosophical disconnect between the players and the owners.The sentiment that a strike will happen is one we’ve become accustomed to hearing from the players. However, Wainwright framed the situation with a little more urgency on Friday by expressing concerns that a day of reckoning could happen sooner than later.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]Speaking to InsideSTL.com’s Tim McKernan, Wainwright said it was inevitable that the players will go on strike unless major changes are made to help bridge the widening gap. But he’s also worried that frustrations could reach a boiling point during the season leading to some form of a revolt. Perhaps even a mid-season walkout.#STLCards pitcher Adam Wainwright on @TMASTL: “Unless something changes, there’s going to be a strike. 100%. I’m just worried people are going to walk-out mid-season.” pic.twitter.com/M8WeRVcASe— Tim McKernan (@tmckernan) February 15, 2019“Unless something changes, there’s going to be a strike. 100%,” Wainwright said regarding the free-agent freeze that has left stars like Bryce Harper and Manny Machado without contracts. “I’m just worried people are going to walkout midseason.”It’s conceivable given the current climate, but a players revolt on that level still feels like a long shot. The target date we should all still be looking at is Dec. 1, 2021. That’s when the current collective bargaining agreement ends and the owners will be forced to come to the table.That doesn’t mean we should just dismiss Wainwright’s concerns about a 2019 strike. While they might feel a little on the dramatic side, the frustration that has built all offseason as dozens of free agents, including and especially Harper and Machado, remain unsigned is becoming more palpable by the day. There’s a genuine feeling that owners are determined to cut back on salaries even as profits continue to reach new heights, it’s possible the players’ patience will run out if the free-agent freeze continues to drag on. Wainwright thinks so, and he’s far from alone.In Friday’s interview, the 37-year-old right-hander also criticized owners and front offense personnel for placing too much emphasis on “analytics” and placing everything in a “sabermetric box” that discounts intangibles and other immeasurable aspects of baseball.Adam Wainwright said today on ⁦@TMASTL⁩ that he expects there to be a strike “100%.”The context of the conversation comes from a discussion on how Bryce Harper and Manny Machado are still without teams.You can see Wainwright’s reasoning in the video below. pic.twitter.com/GXsmx4cXk1— Tim McKernan (@tmckernan) February 15, 2019Wainwright admitted that there’s always risk in making long-term financial commitments to players, but emphasized that doing so marks a commitment to winning that several teams seemingly lack.“Part of it is smart from their side of it, but you have to realize it’s about winning. So, if Bryce Harper wants 10 years and he’s 26 years old. He’s going to be a dynamic player. The same can be said about Manny Machado. These guys are superstar players.”The deeper we get into it the more obvious it is that the players know what battles lie ahead. The only real question is how much worse it will get before any progress is made toward a satisfactory resolution.More from Yahoo Sports:• Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight MLB rumors: Bryce Harper has made his decision, says D.C. radio host originally appeared on nbcsportsbayarea.comA report has come out from the East Coast saying Bryce Harper has come to a decision on which team he will play for in 2019 and beyond.Chris Russell, a sports radio talk show host from 106.7 The Fan in Washington D.C., (who has been on the Harper beat for some time) said the free agent slugger could make a decision in the next 24 hours.\"Maybe I took a little bit of a leap of faith here based on some indications I got from a real good source,\" Russell told 94WIP, in Philadelphia, on Friday.\"Bryce and his representatives, (Scott) Boras, his people, his wife Kayla, they've been meeting since Monday morning in Vegas. Bryce originally wanted this done, when it took this long, by Valentine's Day. Obviously, the contract has not been announced, signed, or whatever.\"\"But I'm led to believe by the people that I've talked to that are close to the situation -- and I have, again, a real good source that has helped me through this process, let's just leave it at that,\" Russell said. \"That Bryce was in a mood to celebrate yesterday. Now, the source said, 'I believe it's done.' I don't have concrete, 100 percent proof for you guys. I wish I did, otherwise, I would have it and I would be running around with it. But I don't have that, so I want to caution everybody in Philadelphia. But that's what I was led to believe, that this thing is now decided.\"Russell then mentioned the Phillies.\"Now, what comes then is hammering out a contract. And if we were to believe the report that the Philadelphia Phillies had not even extended a formal offer -- and I assume that to be a termed, written agreement, that type of thing, which I find hard to believe -- then there might be more legwork to this. And therefore, hey the decision may be done, but the contract still needs to be ironed out.\"[RELATED: Phillies fan participates in \"lent\" in hopes of recruiting Harper]Russell is being safe with the terminology he's using, which is understandable. And while we haven't been able to confirm these rumors, Harper, along with many other free agents, remains unsigned.The Giants appeared to be the \"mystery team\" that introduced themselves late into the Harper sweepstakes -- and when the radio hosts asked Russell his opinion on where the outfielder will end up next season, he believed Harper will be in an orange and black uniform.\"I don't think it's going to be the Nationals,\" Russell said. \"I think it's going to be the San Francisco Giants, but that is not by any means an 'I know that for a fact,' so I want to caution everybody -- I know how this works -- I get in trouble with everything I say on my radio show, and everyone blows it up.\" The wait continues ... Golden State Warriors stars Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant empathised with Steve Kerr after the head coach was ejected during the loss to the Portland Trail Blazers having thrown a clipboard in response to a flagrant foul call.Kerr was enraged late in the fourth quarter when Draymond Green was called for a flagrant foul after he stopped Zach Collins from approaching the rim as he went up for a shot.That drew Kerr's ire and after ranting in one referee's face, he slammed a clipboard down to earn an ejection, with Durant having to escort his head coach back off the court.The Warriors lost the game 129-107 but will still head into the All-Star break with the best record in the Western Conference.\"It was an emotional game. We fought really hard for 43 minutes,\" Curry told reporters afterwards.\"One questionable decision - the flagrant - obviously the fire came out. You see coach go and throw a clipboard. At that point you try to get us over the hump. An eight-point swing, it's tough to overcome.\"\"I looked at the replay and the amount of ball [Green] got, there was nothing excessive about it, he got all the ball.\"There was a lot of chirping, with Zach involved. There was probably a sensitivity to it, trying to put out some fires, but I thought it was a terrible call. We obviously paid the price for it with how everything unfolded after that.\"Durant shared that sympathy having been the one to pull Kerr away from the referees as he continued to rant at them.\"I felt for him, I understand his anger and his rage, especially for that call,\" he said.\"I thought we should have just kept playing, It was a common foul, I thought. Refs looked at it differently. \"I understand why coach was a little frustrated.\"Kerr explained that it was the disbelief at the call that had triggered his reaction.\"I was just shocked that that was called a flagrant foul,\" he said. \"I'm not sure how it's determined - if it's in New York or the officials on the call - but that was head-scratching: that that could be called a flagrant foul.\"The guy's going to go in for a dunk, you've got to make sure he doesn't dunk it.\"So, I told Kenny [Mauer] that I beg to differ. There might have been a couple of other words in there too!\"I'll have to ask the owner if the clipboard broke when I threw it down. I got a little anger out so that was good. I was too busy yelling to ask for an explanation.\"Charles Barkley thinks New Orleans Pelicans star Anthony Davis made a mistake with his trade request.The 25-year-old asked the Pelicans to move him in late January and the Los Angeles Lakers had been engaged in discussions about acquiring him. But, no deal was reached before the deadline and Davis remained with New Orleans.Barkley, an 11-time All-Star who works as an analyst for TNT, said he thinks Davis and his agent, Rich Paul, mishandled the situation.\"Don't ruin your reputation as a great player, one of the nicest guys in the world,\" Barkley told reporters on Thursday ahead of All-Star weekend (via the Washington Post).\"Remember, your agent works for you, you don't work for him. They handled that situation wrong. It's going to come back to bite them in the a***. It's unfortunate.\"The six-time All-Star entered play on Thursday averaging 28.5 points and 13.1 rebounds this season. But, he scored just three points in 24 minutes on the floor in the Pelicans' 118-88 loss to the Orlando Magic earlier this week.\"This is a bad situation,\" Barkley said. \"It's a bad look for the NBA. Because that kid can't go out there and give 100 per cent because he’s worried about getting hurt. The guy's the second-best player in the world and he's got three points? That's not a good look for the NBA.\"The Boston Celtics and New York Knicks, among others, are expected to explore dealing for Davis after the season. Barkley, however, said he believes the forward will eventually land in Los Angeles because of Paul's relationship with Lakers star LeBron James.Barkley tallied 22.1 points and 11.7 rebounds per game over his 16-year career. He retired in 2000 and was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame six years later.After an apology from Sergio Garcia, a non-apology from Matt Kuchar, and an uncooperative Mother Nature on Valentine's Day, it's time for everyone to focus again on Tiger Woods. Kidding. Sort of. A weather-delayed first round at Riviera re-starts on Friday morning and the 14-time major champ will be in the Hollywood-area spotlight as he finally begins his Genesis Open. And golf fans could potentially see a LOT of the tournament host as the event tries to play catch up after heavy rains on Thursday.Woods, Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas (Decent group, eh?) are scheduled to tee off at 8:32 local time (11:32 ET). The hope is they will complete their first rounds and then play as much of their second rounds as possible before darkness. And Tiger's hope is to finally win for the first time at this historic layout where he missed the cut last year. We'll be tracking Tiger every step of the way so keep it right here for the latest scores, news and highlights. (All times eastern)SATURDAY, 11:25: With a 25-foot birdie putt on No. 9, Woods' final hole of the second round, Tiger will likely make the cut. The birdie brought Woods back to even on his round and to one under overall.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096808527694245890After resuming play in the morning, Woods bogeyed his first hole, No. 4, then made four pars before his finishing birdie. His playing partners, however, fared much better. Justin Thomas shares the lead with Adam Scott at 11 under and Rory McIlroy birdied four of his six holes on Saturday morning to shoot 63 and move to seven under through 36 holes. Thursday's early wave is now on the course for their second rounds.-------------------FRIDAY-------------------8:25: And with that, the horn has sounded—play will be suspended for darkness on Friday at Riviera. Tiger, JT and Rory have six more holes to complete their second round. Justin Thomas is at 10-under, tied with Adam Scott for the lead. Tiger will hope Saturday brings some different momentum for him—as this marathon day ends with two bogeys in a row after the highlight eagle.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10965708926692065298:21: That's back-to-back bogeys now for Tiger Woods, dropping another shot here at the third hole (his 12th of the round). And over his past six holes, Tiger has four bogeys. The birdie at No. 1 helped negate most of that damage ... but Tiger's back to 1-under again—right on the current cut line.8:13: On his 30th hole of the day, Tiger is showing some obvious signs of being tired. And who could blame him—he's been playing golf for nearly 10 hours straight. From 165 yards out at the third hole, Tiger Woods tries to chop out a 6-iron and comes out of it. His ball comes to rest short of the green. With sunset in Pacific Palisades being 5:30 local time, this group will have time for maybe one more hole today.8:04: Tiger follows up that eagle putt at No. 1 with a bogey at the second hole. The third bogey of his second round moves Tiger back to 2-under overall.7:56: After a long wait at the second hole, Tiger sprays his second shot from 235 out with a fairway wood out to the right. He'll have his work cut out from the front right bunker to save par at the 482-yard par 4.7:40: This is exactly what Tiger Woods needed: He rolls in his 43-foot eagle putt at his 10th hole (the first) to get back to 3-under—negating those two bogeys he made on his front nine. What a putt! With the flagstick in!https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096570892669206529Tiger made a disappointing par to open his first round earlier today at the first hole. The unlikely eagle makes up for that effort—and could turn around Tiger's second round in a dramatic way. Tiger goes from toeing the cut line at 1-under to now all of a sudden being T-21.7:28: Tiger finds the fairway at the par-5 first hole, the group's 10th hole of their second round, as he attempts to get a shot back here after bogeying two of his final three holes on his front nine. Neither bogey was particularly bad—the 18th hole is playing brutally tough right now uphill and into the wind with the rain, making it even more of a challenging hole. And his break at 16 was very unlucky.7:16: Tiger and JT are gonna have their work cut out to save par at the 18th hole (their ninth). Each player had fairway wood approaches and tried playing a big cut. JT was way up left on the hill—Tiger was closer. He went high with his approach and will have about 11 feet left for par.Tiger misses the par putt, so he'll drop a shot along with JT as they make the turn. Tiger moves back to 1-under after 27 holes. That's where the cut line currently is—so all of a sudden, Tiger must be concerned about making the cut.7:01: Following Justin Thomas throwing a dart at the 17th to about 3 feet, Tiger puts his wedge shot from under 100 yards to outside 20 feet, so he'll be disappointed with that effort. The birdie putt misses on the high side, and Tiger taps in for par to remain at 2-under. His playing partner and buddy Justin Thomas stays hot, rolling in a fourth straight birdie to get to 9-under—tied for the lead with Adam Scott. Really impressive golf here from JT.6:54: The rain is really coming down now as the players head to the 17th hole. Tiger finds the fairway at the par-5 17th hole, but it was a short one—he has 326 yards left. Most players have been laying up at this par 5 all day.6:43: From a brutal position up against the back lip of the bunker, Tiger hacks it out—and somehow keeps the ball on the green, albeit the back portion. His par attempt from 44 feet away here comes up three feet shy. Tiger makes his bogey to move back to 2-under.Meanwhile, Justin Thomas is officially on fire. He has another birdie after a fabulous tee shot at 16. It's now two Kentucky boys tied at the top: Justin Thomas and J.B. Holmes (-8).https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10965576791939317766:39: Tiger will have serious lie issues at the par-3 16th hole. His tee shot came to rest up against the back lip of the bunker. As Billy Kratzert just remarked on PGA Tour Live, Tiger will do well just to keep this ball on the green. Though he avoided dropping a shot on his last hole, there might be a bogey in his future here.6:35: A clutchhh par save by Tiger at the 15th hole makes up for his poor chip—and Tiger keeps the momentum going on his second round, as he stays 3-under for the tournament and 2-under on the round.Justin Thomas, also in Tiger's group, holed out from in front of the green for birdie at the 14th hole, and he makes a long birdie putt at 15 to get to 7-under—just one back of fellow Kentucky native J.B. Holmes.6:32: A poor chip shot from Tiger at the 15th hole leaves him about 13 feet away. He'll need to convert that putt to prevent dropping his first shot of his second round.6:24: Tiger finds another fairway here at Riviera, this one at the 15th hole. The guy is feeeling it with his driver. Almost on auto pilot. His approach from 190 out turns a little too much, finding the rough to the left of the green. He'll have to get up and down to avoid dropping one here.6:20: From 20 feet out, Tiger's birdie bid comes up shy—never really scaring the hole, despite getting a good look at the line from Rory's putt. Tiger taps in for par to remain at 3-under.The putter has been disappointing for Tiger all day: He had 34 putts in his first round, including four three-putts, just the third time in his career he's done that.6:13: Tiger puts his tee shot at the par-3 14th hole just inside Rory's ball—about 20 feet right of the hole. He'll get a little teach from Rory's putt, too, as Tiger continues to hit it well today.6:07: Tiger just misses the left-to-right curling bid for birdie, leaving himself with an easy par at 13. He stays 3-under for the tournament and -2 through four on his round.Tiger's playing partners are also playing well—Rory has three birdies in his first four holes to get to 2-under. Look out for Rory at rainy Riviera. And Justin Thomas, despite hitting his tee shot out of bounds at 13, got up and down from 160 yards to avoid dropping multiple shots. He's now 5-under after that bogey.6:02: Another grooved tee shot for Tiger Woods at the 13th hole puts him in good position. He turned over his tee shot—putting his draw in the middle of the fairway at the dogleg left. Tiger spins his approach back to about 15 feet, just off the green in the fringe. He'll have a chance to knock another one here and keep the momentum going.5:51: Bang! Tiger nails the 25-footer for birdie at the 12th hole to add a second birdie to his card through three holes. Realistically, too, it could be three straight birdies for Tiger. But the 14-time major champion is now 2-under through 3—T-3 for the tournament (T-19)—and carries some strong momentum on his side at the start of his second round ... as the rain is coming down at Riviera.5:46: Tiger hits his approach hole high—about 25 feet from 181 yards. He'll have another chance to add a birdie to his third round.Tiger's currently at 2-under, which puts him at T-29. The projected cut is at 1-under—so he's comfortably inside the number as of now. But there's a ton of golf to be played, obviously.5:41: Tiger finds the fairway with his driver at the par-4 12th hole. The 12th usually plays as one of the toughest holes at Riviera—we'll see if Tiger can take advantage of his position here in the fairway.5:33: An excellent fairway-wood second shot by Tiger put him right in front of the par-5 11th green in two. But a very poor approach putt for his third leaves him more than 10 feet away. His birdie try slides by for a very disappointing par being so close in 2. That should've been a golden opportunity to start his second round with two birdies—instead, Tiger stays at 2-under.5:12: Tiger goes high with his pitch—having to navigate around the front bunker, and plays it nicely—spinning it about 7 feet short of the hole. So Tiger will have a good look for an opening birdie to start his second round. Tiger converts the birdie putt to move to 2-under.5:02: Only a little more than a half hour after finishing his first round, Tiger Woods (-1) -- along with Justin Thomas (-5) and Rory McIlroy (+1) -- has teed off in his second round. The group started on the drivable 10th hole, and Tiger has driven his tee shot just off the green. He'll have a chance to put his pitch shot close to start his second round with a birdie.4:24: Tiger narrowly misses the birdie putt at the 18th hole, so he'll tap in for a par and an opening-round, one-under 70 at Riviera. Having three-putted for a fourth time on the 17th hole to drop a shot in disappointing fashion, Tiger will head to his second round a bit frustrated. But the four consecutive birdies showed him being able to score well at Riviera, where he has never won.Tiger, JT (who birdied 18 to finish at 5-under) and Rory will head right back for their second round in this marathon day for them.4:18: Tiger responds to that shocking three-putt with a perfect drive and a towering 6-iron on Riviera's famed 18th. Woods is in good shape to at least make par the difficult hole, but as we've seen all day, a two-putt is anything but automatic.Here's an unusual stat on Tiger three-putting four times this afternoon. He's making some history in a bad way...https://twitter.com/JustinRayGolf/status/10965196250582507574:06: So much for the momentum. . . After a decent approach shot that spins back to about 20 feet, Woods runs his birdie putt a couple feet by and. . . gulp. . . misses the comebacker from about two feet. Wow. That's four three-putts on the day as Tiger falls back to one under with one hole to play.3:57: Uh-oh, it's raining in southern California again. Meanwhile, Woods is plodding his way up the par-5 17th. After pulling his drive into the left rough and drawing a poor lie, Woods pushed his layup slightly into the first cut of the right rough. He'll have a some sort of wedge to a back-right hole location.3:50: Tiger's tee shot was tracking on the par-3 16th, but it comes up about 30 feet short. From there, he two-putts for par to remain at two under. Justin Thomas makes his 10-foot birdie effort to move to four under, while Rory McIlroy remains at one over. McIlroy hast two holes to avert his first over-par score of 2019.3:40: After another great drive and a solid approach, Woods races his birdie attempt nearly five feet past the hole. But he keeps the overall positive momentum going by converting the par putt to remain at two under. Tiger has three more holes to play. At least, before he gets a lunch break.3:24: BANG! There's the bounce back from Tiger. It just came one hole later. And from farther away as Woods drains his 12-footer for birdie on No. 14.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096507996031467520Woods is now back to two under, five shots behind Jordan Spieth, who has to be pleased to still be in front by two despite these soft conditions.3:17: Tiger hits a great shot on the difficult par-3 14th hole to about 15 feet. He'll have a good look at birdie coming up. In the meantime, here's a look at how the leader board stands with Jordan Spieth still leading the way.Jordan Spieth (-7) 2t. Tony Finau (-5) 2t. Patrick Rodgers (-5) 2t. Kramer Hickok (-5) 2t. Davis Love III (-5) 2t. Adam Scott (-5) 2t. J.B. Homes (-5)Click here for full scores.3:13: Woods stuck his approach to about four feet below the hole on No. 13. A bounce back birdie looked like a forgone conclusion until he pushed his effort. Woof. That's two three-putts and two short misses on the greens for Tiger today. He remains at one under. Meanwhile, Rory McIlroy, after getting to two under through eight, has fallen to one over after back-to-back bogeys. Justin Thomas, the third player in the group, continues to lead this trio at three under.3:05: After hitting fade after fade, Woods steps to the 13th tee and rips a draw around the corner, perfectly setting up his next shot. Good to see him working it both ways with ease.3:01: Tiger pushed his tee shot into the right rough, then hit a fantastic recovery shot from a thick lie onto the green. He had a long look at birdie that rolled about four feet past, leaving him with a tricky left-to-right par putt, which he missed. That's three three putts on the day for Woods, and he's still one under.2:39: Not the best chip from Woods, as he left himself about six feet for birdie, but he makes it anyway. Four straight for Tiger to get to two under for the day.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10964952191957975042:30: Woods rips a 3-wood from 269 to just in front of the green. Hate to jinx him, but there's no reason he shouldn't easily make his fourth straight birdie here (ducks).2:20: Three in a row for Woods as he rolls in another at No. 10 and moves to one under. If he finds the fairway again at the 11th, four in a row will be in his sights. Meanwhile, Rory makes his par to stay at one under and JT ends up holing his 10 footer for birdie to get to four under. Finally a little bit of JUICE from this threesome.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096489287753711616https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096489787672780800By the way, it looks like we know when they'll be heading back out for round two later today. Here's an update from the Tiger Tracker:https://twitter.com/GCTigerTracker/status/1096481806067523585That should give them enough time to get at least 11 or 12 holes in.At the 11th, Woods stripes another drive down the fairway. He's really starting to cook.2:12: Tiger's shot was a tad more difficult than we thought, as he had to avoid a bunker and take it up high to get it back to the pin. He was successful, sticking it to about three feet. Hell of a shot. Even better was Rory's shot, as he flopped it from a nice lie and got it to hang on just off the back of the green and stay out of the back bunker. Thomas, who had the easiest shot, put too much spin on his chip, leaving himself with about 10 feet for birdie.2:07: Finally, Tiger, Rory and JT hit their tee shots, and it looks like the ensuing entertainment will be well worth the wait. Tiger is in the collection area left of the green, where he has a straightforward chip that should set him up with a good chance to make birdie. Thomas is just in front of the green, and he'll have a great chance to make a birdie as well. Rory ... um ... not so much. He's in the rough with a greenside bunker in front of him and a pin he won't be able to get close to, and just holding the green would be a miracle.1:52: Woods drains his four-footer for bird and turns in even par 35. Real strong finish to his opening nine, and now it looks like he'll have a long wait at the 10th. DeChambeau, Kuchar and Rahm have still yet to hit their tee shots.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10964831254067896321:47: Tiger had just 122 left to the green and stuck one in there close. He has four feet left for birdie to turn in even par, which would be a small victory after that ugly three putt back at No. 7. Not to mention he'll have a prime opportunity to get into red figures at the driveable par-4 10th.1:41: Woods cranks another high fade right down the middle with the driver at No. 9. With the tees up today, he'll have a low iron in his hand for his approach.1:34: And he's on the board! Woods bounces back with a birdie putt from 15 feet, getting him back to one over. We'll see if that gets him going before making the turn.1:30: From 125 yards out, Woods hit a wedge and hated it from the second he made contact. While he did pull it, he's still hole high and inside 20 feet. Hideki Matsuyama-esque move from Tiger.1:24: Woods rips one right down the middle at the par-4 eighth. Should have a short iron in.1:15: Tiger's birdie putt was actually from just off the green on the fringe, and he rolled it by some four feet. Then, he missed the comebacker for par, dropping to two over on the day. Oof.1:09: Fairway and a green for Woods at the seventh. Good look at birdie coming up to get back to level par.12:58: Another hole, another par for Woods, who two-putted from 24 feet on the par-3 sixth. In the group up ahead, though, Jon Rahm is making a move at three under through six.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/109646557828021452912:47: Another meh hole for Tiger on No. 5, just missing the fairway with his tee shot, finding the front of the green with a so-so approach, and two-putting for another par from 43 feet. Woods remains at one over through five holes while his playing partners, McIlroy and Thomas, both remain at one under.12:42: As Matt Kuchar's ball is in the air on the par-3 sixth, a fan yells, \"Go low—just not with the gratuity!\" Despite Matt maintaining this is \"not a story,\" it is. And this won't be the last comment like this.12:29: Woods hit a nice shot to about 15 feet on the par-3 fourth, but ran his birdie effort by the hole. Still one over. Still no highlights. At least, from Tiger. Here was Spieth's closing birdie from about an hour ago, because there is not much else exciting going on right now.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/109644546143346688112:17: Another missed fairway and another short approach from Tiger on the par-4 third. Although, Woods found the putting surface, he was unable to two-putt from 63 feet, missing a seven-footer for par after badly misreading his first putt. That drops Tiger to one over through three holes. Not a lot of highlights so far. . .12:02: Tiger misses right off the tee on No. 2 then comes up short on another approach. But his pitch shot nearly goes down, leaving him with a tap-in par. Even par through two holes.11:49: After that perfect opening tee shot, Tiger hit a hideous approach with a 5-iron that came up way short in a fairway bunker. From there, he hit his third to 10 feet but missed the putt to walk away with a disappointing par. Both of Tiger's playing partners, McIlroy and Thomas, make birdie.11:38: Matt Kuchar just misses his eagle attempt from 25 feet on No. 1, but taps in for birdie. Kuchar has been in the news a lot this week over a caddie controversy dating back to his win at the Mayakoba Golf Classic. A controversy he didn't help with his comments on Wednesday. Is it possible some of those \"Kuuuuch\" shouts will turn to \"Mooooch\"? Kinda sounded like it on the first hole. . .11:34: Jordan Spieth is in with a seven-under-par 64 to take the early lead. Spieth needed only 21 putts during his bogey-free round. Of course, starting tournaments hasn't been a problem for Spieth of late. Finishing, however, has been a different story. Incredibly, Spieth is looking for his first win since the 2017 British Open and his first top 5 since last year's Masters.11:32: Woods smashes a driver off the first tee that finds the fairway. The opening par 5 at Riviera is essentially a long par 4 and one of the easiest holes on the PGA Tour all year so Tiger is thinking at least birdie after that tee shot.10:53: So far, so good on the Friday weather:https://twitter.com/GCTigerTracker/status/1096437235262533632And with lift, clean and place in play (for at least the first round), low scores are out there. Let's set the over/under on the Par-71 layout at 68.5.10:45: We are approximately 45 minutes away from Tiger's tee time and it's another major champ who is already off to a fantastic start. Jordan Spieth has the lead at six under through 15 holes. Spieth leads Patrick Rodgers by one and then there's a big group at four under, including Bill Haas, who is playing in the event a year after being involved in a car accident during last year's tournament that killed a friend he was staying with. Make sure you read Brian Wacker's piece from earlier in the week on how Haas is still trying to move on from that tragedy.10:35: As we move within an hour from Tiger teeing off, check out GOLFTV's latest behind-the-scenes video with Woods in which he says his bag has up to 16(!) golf gloves during rainy rounds and he explains why he doesn't like wearing rain jackets:https://twitter.com/GOLFTV/status/1096246456795697153\"Pops used to say, 'Once you're wet, you're wet. Deal with it.'\" Talk about a great life lesson.WATCH MORE VIDEOS FROM THE LOOPMagic Johnson got the Lakers fined for tweets he sent while holding a ceremonial executive title. Once he started running the front office, his blinking at Paul George on national TV contributed to the Lakers getting fined again for tampering. Johnson’s praise of Giannis Antetokounmpo drew yet another tampering fine.So, though he escaped punishment for his recent comments on 76ers guard Ben Simmons, Johnson refused to answer a question about Hornets guard Kemba Walker.Carolina Blitz:Asked Magic about Kemba and he said y’all aren’t going to catch him slipping anymore. pic.twitter.com/sQZtIWnQbn— Carolina Blitz (@KeepBlitzin) February 15, 2019Johnson:You know I can’t answer any questions about no players, because every time I do it, I get fined. But anybody else do it, they don’t get fined. So I’m going to stay away from that one.I don’t blame Johnson for feeling that way.Other teams’ owners, coaches and executives have repeatedly publicly discussed rival players without facing announced punishment.To be fair, the NBA doesn’t reveal every fine. Bucks owner Marc Lasry reportedly just got fined for tampering, but the league never announced it. But, at minimum, there’s an inconsistency with how the NBA exposes Johnson’s transgressions.Even NBA commissioner Adam Silver said last year there’s a spotlight on the Lakers due to prior tampering. That strikes me as unfair. The Lakers already paid for their prior violations and should now be held to the same standard as everyone else.And for what it’s worth, I wish that standard allowed an all-time great point guard like Johnson to publicly share his thoughts on Kemba Walker.\n"

Yahoo Sports' Charles Robinson and Amanda Borges address the settlement between the players and the NFL, and what it means for their continuing efforts to promote social activism.The NBA jerseys of the future have a new feature to them: the ability to customize them after purchase by changing the name and number.In an awkward reveal reminiscent of a tech presentation, NBA commissioner Adam Silver and sportscaster Ahmad Rashad demonstrated the jersey at the NBA Tech Summit on Friday ahead of All-Star Weekend in Charlotte, switching a No. 30 Stephen Curry jersey to No. 23 Michael Jordan threads.Adam Silver just revealed the NBA jersey of the future that changes the name and number 🤯(via @NBA)pic.twitter.com/cgJk7KcIIU— Yahoo Sports (@YahooSports) February 15, 2019If Silver is trying to pull a Steve Jobs, perhaps he should stick to his day job. But in all seriousness, the jersey presents some interesting questions: Will it be easier for fans to “bandwagon”? Can players switch jerseys mid-game? Will Drake be first in line for this new prop?Meanwhile, Twitter had all of the jokes.Jersey cost only 20 easy installments of, $999.99.— Vod Kanockers (@JHoward2716) February 15, 2019Kevin Durant can now switch teams mid game with these new #NBA jerseys 😳 pic.twitter.com/a01rMkiexr— OT Sports Podcast Network (@OTSportsPod) February 15, 2019This could go one of two ways: Either the NBA will have found another way to separate itself from the other sports leagues or it will be a pointless feature that exists just because there is the technology to make it happen and for Twitter to crack jokes. In any case, you have to admit the NBA never fails to entertain.More from Yahoo Sports: • Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight When spring training camps opened this week around Major League Baseball, it brought hope that maybe, finally, Bryce Harper and Manny Machado would sign with teams and baseball’s long free-agent freeze would melt away.Nope. Not yet. Not only has that not happened, something else did happen: a number of talented young players around the league have agreed to team-friendly contract extensions.The latest was New York Yankees ace Luis Severino, who on Friday reportedly agreed to a four-year, $40 million deal. The deal, first reported by Joel Sherman of the New York Post, would buy up Severino’s arbitration years and comes with a $15 million club option for his first year of free agency.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]By agreeing to this deal, the Yankees and Severino avoid arbitration for 2019. He’ll make $4 million this season, $10 million next, then $10.25 million in 2021 and $11 million in 2022. The club option is for 2023. In the grand scheme of society, this is a very generous contract. In baseball’s economic bubble, it’s another young player signing for below-market value relative to his skills and potential.It’s hard to blame Severino for taking the deal, looking around at a free-agent world where Harper and Machado are still available, as are Dallas Keuchel and Craig Kimbrel. Especially since we haven’t heard even slight grumblings about teams being interested in Keuchel and Kimbrel.Coming off a breakout season in which he went 19-8 with a 3.39 ERA, the 25-year-old Severino was given a deal that’s pretty hard to turn down: “Do you want $40 million guaranteed, yes or no?”The other players faced with a similar question this week were Philadelphia Phillies ace Aaron Nola, who said yes to a four-year, $45 million deal Wednesday. It also avoided arbitration and bought out two of Nola’s free agency years, making it the most below-market deal of any of these.The Minnesota Twins locked up two of their talented young players Thursday, as right fielder Max Kepler agreed to a five-year, $35 million deal with a $10 million club option for 2024. It buys out three years of free agency for Kepler, 26. Shortstop Jorge Polanco also agreed to a five-year extension, his is worth $25.75 million with two option years that could keep him in Minnesota through 2025.In a vacuum, these types of extensions look like win-wins: The players get guaranteed money as they’re coming off good seasons. The clubs get cost-certainty to help them navigate the future — whether it’s the Yankees and Phillies trying to add big free agents this year or next, or a team like the Twins striving for contention with a homegrown core.In a bigger sense, though, it’s hard not to look at these deals in the current state of free agency and wonder if they’re a symptom of something else. Is it the market correcting itself? Is it baseball’s economy morphing into something new? Or maybe it’s just players looking around and saying, “Well, I better get my money now.”According to numerous reports, there’s a fear that for this generation of young players the light at the end of the tunnel — the big free-agency payday — won’t be there for them in the same way it was for so many other players.So while it’s great that stars like Justin Verlander, Clayton Kershaw and Max Scherzer are publicly speaking out about the current state of free agency, they’re on the right side of it. They got their mega deals.The younger players find themselves in a different sort of peril. It’s entirely possible that these are the biggest paydays these players ever get, which is a much different economic model that we’ve seen from baseball in the past.Whether it’s right or wrong — and that’s certainly something that’s up for debate heading into the next collective-bargaining agreement — baseball’s economy has often been backward. Players get paid less, relative to the market, in their pre-free agency years. The best recent example is Mike Trout winning the MVP in 2014 at age 22 while making $1 million.He got a raise to $6 million the next season, but in 2015 was still making a fraction of what people like Ryan Howard ($25M), Albert Pujols ($24M), Joe Mauer ($23M), Mark Teixeira ($22.5M) and Jose Reyes ($22M) were making.But that overpay is a necessary part baseball’s economic ecosystem too. It’s a fact: Players get overpaid as their careers decline. It’s almost like baseball’s way of making up for underpaying players during their early years. It’s baseball’s golden parachute. What’s happening these days is fewer teams are accepting that overpay as part of the how the system works.In the past few years, arbitration salaries have gotten higher and higher, and teams have tried harder to lock up younger stars before free agency. It’s why we’ve see players like Madison Bumgarner, Chris Archer, Chris Sale and Paul Goldschmidt become valuable trade chips for their team-friendly contract extensions.Teams are getting smarter about where their money goes, and how to keep value in their assets. These extensions to Severino, Nola and the rest show that they’re willing to spend money, just in the way that they want.Earlier this week, former Miami Marlins president David Samson tweeted something in response to Justin Verlander, saying the “broken system” talk was wrong. Players and their agents, Samson said, needed to adjust to a “new reality.”He may be right about the new reality part. The monster paydays at the end of the free agency tunnel could be fading away. If Bryce Harper and Manny Machado can’t get them, who can?The new reality could be players seizing their money. Whenever they can.– – – – – –Mike Oz is a writer at Yahoo Sports.

However, Wainwright framed the situation with a little more urgency on Friday by expressing concerns that a day of reckoning could happen sooner than later.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]Speaking to InsideSTL.com’s Tim McKernan, Wainwright said it was inevitable that the players will go on strike unless major changes are made to help bridge the widening gap. But he’s also worried that frustrations could reach a boiling point during the season leading to some form of a revolt. Perhaps even a mid-season walkout.#STLCards pitcher Adam Wainwright on @TMASTL: “Unless something changes, there’s going to be a strike. 100%. I’m just worried people are going to walk-out mid-season.” pic.twitter.com/M8WeRVcASe— Tim McKernan (@tmckernan) February 15, 2019“Unless something changes, there’s going to be a strike. 100%,” Wainwright said regarding the free-agent freeze that has left stars like Bryce Harper and Manny Machado without contracts. “I’m just worried people are going to walkout midseason.”It’s conceivable given the current climate, but a players revolt on that level still feels like a long shot. The target date we should all still be looking at is Dec. 1, 2021. That’s when the current collective bargaining agreement ends and the owners will be forced to come to the table.That doesn’t mean we should just dismiss Wainwright’s concerns about a 2019 strike. While they might feel a little on the dramatic side, the frustration that has built all offseason as dozens of free agents, including and especially Harper and Machado, remain unsigned is becoming more palpable by the day. There’s a genuine feeling that owners are determined to cut back on salaries even as profits continue to reach new heights, it’s possible the players’ patience will run out if the free-agent freeze continues to drag on. Wainwright thinks so, and he’s far from alone.In Friday’s interview, the 37-year-old right-hander also criticized owners and front offense personnel for placing too much emphasis on “analytics” and placing everything in a “sabermetric box” that discounts intangibles and other immeasurable aspects of baseball.Adam Wainwright said today on ⁦@TMASTL⁩ that he expects there to be a strike “100%.”The context of the conversation comes from a discussion on how Bryce Harper and Manny Machado are still without teams.You can see Wainwright’s reasoning in the video below. pic.twitter.com/GXsmx4cXk1— Tim McKernan (@tmckernan) February 15, 2019Wainwright admitted that there’s always risk in making long-term financial commitments to players, but emphasized that doing so marks a commitment to winning that several teams seemingly lack.“Part of it is smart from their side of it, but you have to realize it’s about winning. So, if Bryce Harper wants 10 years and he’s 26 years old. He’s going to be a dynamic player. The same can be said about Manny Machado. These guys are superstar players.”The deeper we get into it the more obvious it is that the players know what battles lie ahead. The only real question is how much worse it will get before any progress is made toward a satisfactory resolution.More from Yahoo Sports:• Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight MLB rumors: Bryce Harper has made his decision, says D.C. radio host originally appeared on nbcsportsbayarea.comA report has come out from the East Coast saying Bryce Harper has come to a decision on which team he will play for in 2019 and beyond.Chris Russell, a sports radio talk show host from 106.7 The Fan in Washington D.C., (who has been on the Harper beat for some time) said the free agent slugger could make a decision in the next 24 hours.\"Maybe I took a little bit of a leap of faith here based on some indications I got from a real good source,\" Russell told 94WIP, in Philadelphia, on Friday.\"Bryce and his representatives, (Scott) Boras, his people, his wife Kayla, they've been meeting since Monday morning in Vegas. Bryce originally wanted this done, when it took this long, by Valentine's Day. Obviously, the contract has not been announced, signed, or whatever.\"\"But I'm led to believe by the people that I've talked to that are close to the situation -- and I have, again, a real good source that has helped me through this process, let's just leave it at that,\" Russell said. \"That Bryce was in a mood to celebrate yesterday. Now, the source said, 'I believe it's done.' I don't have concrete, 100 percent proof for you guys. I wish I did, otherwise, I would have it and I would be running around with it. But I don't have that, so I want to caution everybody in Philadelphia. But that's what I was led to believe, that this thing is now decided.\"Russell then mentioned the Phillies.\"Now, what comes then is hammering out a contract. And if we were to believe the report that the Philadelphia Phillies had not even extended a formal offer -- and I assume that to be a termed, written agreement, that type of thing, which I find hard to believe -- then there might be more legwork to this. And therefore, hey the decision may be done, but the contract still needs to be ironed out.\"[RELATED: Phillies fan participates in \"lent\" in hopes of recruiting Harper]Russell is being safe with the terminology he's using, which is understandable. And while we haven't been able to confirm these rumors, Harper, along with many other free agents, remains unsigned.The Giants appeared to be the \"mystery team\" that introduced themselves late into the Harper sweepstakes -- and when the radio hosts asked Russell his opinion on where the outfielder will end up next season, he believed Harper will be in an orange and black uniform.\"I don't think it's going to be the Nationals,\" Russell said. \"I think it's going to be the San Francisco Giants, but that is not by any means an 'I know that for a fact,' so I want to caution everybody -- I know how this works -- I get in trouble with everything I say on my radio show, and everyone blows it up.\" The wait continues ... Golden State Warriors stars Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant empathised with Steve Kerr after the head coach was ejected during the loss to the Portland Trail Blazers having thrown a clipboard in response to a flagrant foul call.Kerr was enraged late in the fourth quarter when Draymond Green was called for a flagrant foul after he stopped Zach Collins from approaching the rim as he went up for a shot.That drew Kerr's ire and after ranting in one referee's face, he slammed a clipboard down to earn an ejection, with Durant having to escort his head coach back off the court.The Warriors lost the game 129-107 but will still head into the All-Star break with the best record in the Western Conference.\"It was an emotional game. We fought really hard for 43 minutes,\" Curry told reporters afterwards.\"One questionable decision - the flagrant - obviously the fire came out. You see coach go and throw a clipboard. At that point you try to get us over the hump. An eight-point swing, it's tough to overcome.\"\"I looked at the replay and the amount of ball [Green] got, there was nothing excessive about it, he got all the ball.\"There was a lot of chirping, with Zach involved. There was probably a sensitivity to it, trying to put out some fires, but I thought it was a terrible call. We obviously paid the price for it with how everything unfolded after that.\"Durant shared that sympathy having been the one to pull Kerr away from the referees as he continued to rant at them.\"I felt for him, I understand his anger and his rage, especially for that call,\" he said.\"I thought we should have just kept playing, It was a common foul, I thought. Refs looked at it differently. \"I understand why coach was a little frustrated.\"Kerr explained that it was the disbelief at the call that had triggered his reaction.\"I was just shocked that that was called a flagrant foul,\" he said. \"I'm not sure how it's determined - if it's in New York or the officials on the call - but that was head-scratching: that that could be called a flagrant foul.\"The guy's going to go in for a dunk, you've got to make sure he doesn't dunk it.\"So, I told Kenny [Mauer] that I beg to differ. There might have been a couple of other words in there too!\"I'll have to ask the owner if the clipboard broke when I threw it down. I got a little anger out so that was good. I was too busy yelling to ask for an explanation.\"Charles Barkley thinks New Orleans Pelicans star Anthony Davis made a mistake with his trade request.The 25-year-old asked the Pelicans to move him in late January and the Los Angeles Lakers had been engaged in discussions about acquiring him. But, no deal was reached before the deadline and Davis remained with New Orleans.Barkley, an 11-time All-Star who works as an analyst for TNT, said he thinks Davis and his agent, Rich Paul, mishandled the situation.\"Don't ruin your reputation as a great player, one of the nicest guys in the world,\" Barkley told reporters on Thursday ahead of All-Star weekend (via the Washington Post).\"Remember, your agent works for you, you don't work for him. They handled that situation wrong. It's going to come back to bite them in the a***. It's unfortunate.\"The six-time All-Star entered play on Thursday averaging 28.5 points and 13.1 rebounds this season. But, he scored just three points in 24 minutes on the floor in the Pelicans' 118-88 loss to the Orlando Magic earlier this week.\"This is a bad situation,\" Barkley said. \"It's a bad look for the NBA. Because that kid can't go out there and give 100 per cent because he’s worried about getting hurt. The guy's the second-best player in the world and he's got three points? That's not a good look for the NBA.\"The Boston Celtics and New York Knicks, among others, are expected to explore dealing for Davis after the season. Barkley, however, said he believes the forward will eventually land in Los Angeles because of Paul's relationship with Lakers star LeBron James.Barkley tallied 22.1 points and 11.7 rebounds per game over his 16-year career. He retired in 2000 and was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame six years later.After an apology from Sergio Garcia, a non-apology from Matt Kuchar, and an uncooperative Mother Nature on Valentine's Day, it's time for everyone to focus again on Tiger Woods. Kidding. Sort of. A weather-delayed first round at Riviera re-starts on Friday morning and the 14-time major champ will be in the Hollywood-area spotlight as he finally begins his Genesis Open. And golf fans could potentially see a LOT of the tournament host as the event tries to play catch up after heavy rains on Thursday.Woods, Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas (Decent group, eh?) are scheduled to tee off at 8:32 local time (11:32 ET). The hope is they will complete their first rounds and then play as much of their second rounds as possible before darkness. And Tiger's hope is to finally win for the first time at this historic layout where he missed the cut last year. We'll be tracking Tiger every step of the way so keep it right here for the latest scores, news and highlights. (All times eastern)SATURDAY, 11:25: With a 25-foot birdie putt on No. 9, Woods' final hole of the second round, Tiger will likely make the cut. The birdie brought Woods back to even on his round and to one under overall.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096808527694245890After resuming play in the morning, Woods bogeyed his first hole, No. 4, then made four pars before his finishing birdie. His playing partners, however, fared much better. Justin Thomas shares the lead with Adam Scott at 11 under and Rory McIlroy birdied four of his six holes on Saturday morning to shoot 63 and move to seven under through 36 holes. Thursday's early wave is now on the course for their second rounds.-------------------FRIDAY-------------------8:25: And with that, the horn has sounded—play will be suspended for darkness on Friday at Riviera. Tiger, JT and Rory have six more holes to complete their second round. Justin Thomas is at 10-under, tied with Adam Scott for the lead. Tiger will hope Saturday brings some different momentum for him—as this marathon day ends with two bogeys in a row after the highlight eagle.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10965708926692065298:21: That's back-to-back bogeys now for Tiger Woods, dropping another shot here at the third hole (his 12th of the round). And over his past six holes, Tiger has four bogeys. The birdie at No. 1 helped negate most of that damage ... but Tiger's back to 1-under again—right on the current cut line.8:13: On his 30th hole of the day, Tiger is showing some obvious signs of being tired. And who could blame him—he's been playing golf for nearly 10 hours straight. From 165 yards out at the third hole, Tiger Woods tries to chop out a 6-iron and comes out of it. His ball comes to rest short of the green. With sunset in Pacific Palisades being 5:30 local time, this group will have time for maybe one more hole today.8:04: Tiger follows up that eagle putt at No. 1 with a bogey at the second hole. The third bogey of his second round moves Tiger back to 2-under overall.7:56: After a long wait at the second hole, Tiger sprays his second shot from 235 out with a fairway wood out to the right. He'll have his work cut out from the front right bunker to save par at the 482-yard par 4.7:40: This is exactly what Tiger Woods needed: He rolls in his 43-foot eagle putt at his 10th hole (the first) to get back to 3-under—negating those two bogeys he made on his front nine. What a putt! With the flagstick in!https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096570892669206529Tiger made a disappointing par to open his first round earlier today at the first hole. The unlikely eagle makes up for that effort—and could turn around Tiger's second round in a dramatic way. Tiger goes from toeing the cut line at 1-under to now all of a sudden being T-21.7:28: Tiger finds the fairway at the par-5 first hole, the group's 10th hole of their second round, as he attempts to get a shot back here after bogeying two of his final three holes on his front nine. Neither bogey was particularly bad—the 18th hole is playing brutally tough right now uphill and into the wind with the rain, making it even more of a challenging hole. And his break at 16 was very unlucky.7:16: Tiger and JT are gonna have their work cut out to save par at the 18th hole (their ninth). Each player had fairway wood approaches and tried playing a big cut. JT was way up left on the hill—Tiger was closer. He went high with his approach and will have about 11 feet left for par.Tiger misses the par putt, so he'll drop a shot along with JT as they make the turn. Tiger moves back to 1-under after 27 holes. That's where the cut line currently is—so all of a sudden, Tiger must be concerned about making the cut.7:01: Following Justin Thomas throwing a dart at the 17th to about 3 feet, Tiger puts his wedge shot from under 100 yards to outside 20 feet, so he'll be disappointed with that effort. The birdie putt misses on the high side, and Tiger taps in for par to remain at 2-under. His playing partner and buddy Justin Thomas stays hot, rolling in a fourth straight birdie to get to 9-under—tied for the lead with Adam Scott. Really impressive golf here from JT.6:54: The rain is really coming down now as the players head to the 17th hole. Tiger finds the fairway at the par-5 17th hole, but it was a short one—he has 326 yards left. Most players have been laying up at this par 5 all day.6:43: From a brutal position up against the back lip of the bunker, Tiger hacks it out—and somehow keeps the ball on the green, albeit the back portion. His par attempt from 44 feet away here comes up three feet shy. Tiger makes his bogey to move back to 2-under.Meanwhile, Justin Thomas is officially on fire. He has another birdie after a fabulous tee shot at 16. It's now two Kentucky boys tied at the top: Justin Thomas and J.B. Holmes (-8).https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10965576791939317766:39: Tiger will have serious lie issues at the par-3 16th hole. His tee shot came to rest up against the back lip of the bunker. As Billy Kratzert just remarked on PGA Tour Live, Tiger will do well just to keep this ball on the green. Though he avoided dropping a shot on his last hole, there might be a bogey in his future here.6:35: A clutchhh par save by Tiger at the 15th hole makes up for his poor chip—and Tiger keeps the momentum going on his second round, as he stays 3-under for the tournament and 2-under on the round.Justin Thomas, also in Tiger's group, holed out from in front of the green for birdie at the 14th hole, and he makes a long birdie putt at 15 to get to 7-under—just one back of fellow Kentucky native J.B. Holmes.6:32: A poor chip shot from Tiger at the 15th hole leaves him about 13 feet away. He'll need to convert that putt to prevent dropping his first shot of his second round.6:24: Tiger finds another fairway here at Riviera, this one at the 15th hole. The guy is feeeling it with his driver. Almost on auto pilot. His approach from 190 out turns a little too much, finding the rough to the left of the green. He'll have to get up and down to avoid dropping one here.6:20: From 20 feet out, Tiger's birdie bid comes up shy—never really scaring the hole, despite getting a good look at the line from Rory's putt. Tiger taps in for par to remain at 3-under.The putter has been disappointing for Tiger all day: He had 34 putts in his first round, including four three-putts, just the third time in his career he's done that.6:13: Tiger puts his tee shot at the par-3 14th hole just inside Rory's ball—about 20 feet right of the hole. He'll get a little teach from Rory's putt, too, as Tiger continues to hit it well today.6:07: Tiger just misses the left-to-right curling bid for birdie, leaving himself with an easy par at 13. He stays 3-under for the tournament and -2 through four on his round.Tiger's playing partners are also playing well—Rory has three birdies in his first four holes to get to 2-under. Look out for Rory at rainy Riviera. And Justin Thomas, despite hitting his tee shot out of bounds at 13, got up and down from 160 yards to avoid dropping multiple shots. He's now 5-under after that bogey.6:02: Another grooved tee shot for Tiger Woods at the 13th hole puts him in good position. He turned over his tee shot—putting his draw in the middle of the fairway at the dogleg left. Tiger spins his approach back to about 15 feet, just off the green in the fringe. He'll have a chance to knock another one here and keep the momentum going.5:51: Bang! Tiger nails the 25-footer for birdie at the 12th hole to add a second birdie to his card through three holes. Realistically, too, it could be three straight birdies for Tiger. But the 14-time major champion is now 2-under through 3—T-3 for the tournament (T-19)—and carries some strong momentum on his side at the start of his second round ... as the rain is coming down at Riviera.5:46: Tiger hits his approach hole high—about 25 feet from 181 yards. He'll have another chance to add a birdie to his third round.Tiger's currently at 2-under, which puts him at T-29. The projected cut is at 1-under—so he's comfortably inside the number as of now. But there's a ton of golf to be played, obviously.5:41: Tiger finds the fairway with his driver at the par-4 12th hole. The 12th usually plays as one of the toughest holes at Riviera—we'll see if Tiger can take advantage of his position here in the fairway.5:33: An excellent fairway-wood second shot by Tiger put him right in front of the par-5 11th green in two. But a very poor approach putt for his third leaves him more than 10 feet away. His birdie try slides by for a very disappointing par being so close in 2. That should've been a golden opportunity to start his second round with two birdies—instead, Tiger stays at 2-under.5:12: Tiger goes high with his pitch—having to navigate around the front bunker, and plays it nicely—spinning it about 7 feet short of the hole. So Tiger will have a good look for an opening birdie to start his second round. Tiger converts the birdie putt to move to 2-under.5:02: Only a little more than a half hour after finishing his first round, Tiger Woods (-1) -- along with Justin Thomas (-5) and Rory McIlroy (+1) -- has teed off in his second round. The group started on the drivable 10th hole, and Tiger has driven his tee shot just off the green. He'll have a chance to put his pitch shot close to start his second round with a birdie.4:24: Tiger narrowly misses the birdie putt at the 18th hole, so he'll tap in for a par and an opening-round, one-under 70 at Riviera. Having three-putted for a fourth time on the 17th hole to drop a shot in disappointing fashion, Tiger will head to his second round a bit frustrated. But the four consecutive birdies showed him being able to score well at Riviera, where he has never won.Tiger, JT (who birdied 18 to finish at 5-under) and Rory will head right back for their second round in this marathon day for them.4:18: Tiger responds to that shocking three-putt with a perfect drive and a towering 6-iron on Riviera's famed 18th. Woods is in good shape to at least make par the difficult hole, but as we've seen all day, a two-putt is anything but automatic.Here's an unusual stat on Tiger three-putting four times this afternoon. He's making some history in a bad way...https://twitter.com/JustinRayGolf/status/10965196250582507574:06: So much for the momentum. . . After a decent approach shot that spins back to about 20 feet, Woods runs his birdie putt a couple feet by and. . . gulp. . . misses the comebacker from about two feet. Wow. That's four three-putts on the day as Tiger falls back to one under with one hole to play.3:57: Uh-oh, it's raining in southern California again. Meanwhile, Woods is plodding his way up the par-5 17th. After pulling his drive into the left rough and drawing a poor lie, Woods pushed his layup slightly into the first cut of the right rough. He'll have a some sort of wedge to a back-right hole location.3:50: Tiger's tee shot was tracking on the par-3 16th, but it comes up about 30 feet short. From there, he two-putts for par to remain at two under. Justin Thomas makes his 10-foot birdie effort to move to four under, while Rory McIlroy remains at one over. McIlroy hast two holes to avert his first over-par score of 2019.3:40: After another great drive and a solid approach, Woods races his birdie attempt nearly five feet past the hole. But he keeps the overall positive momentum going by converting the par putt to remain at two under. Tiger has three more holes to play. At least, before he gets a lunch break.3:24: BANG! There's the bounce back from Tiger. It just came one hole later. And from farther away as Woods drains his 12-footer for birdie on No. 14.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096507996031467520Woods is now back to two under, five shots behind Jordan Spieth, who has to be pleased to still be in front by two despite these soft conditions.3:17: Tiger hits a great shot on the difficult par-3 14th hole to about 15 feet. He'll have a good look at birdie coming up. In the meantime, here's a look at how the leader board stands with Jordan Spieth still leading the way.Jordan Spieth (-7) 2t. Tony Finau (-5) 2t. Patrick Rodgers (-5) 2t. Kramer Hickok (-5) 2t. Davis Love III (-5) 2t. Adam Scott (-5) 2t. J.B. Homes (-5)Click here for full scores.3:13: Woods stuck his approach to about four feet below the hole on No. 13. A bounce back birdie looked like a forgone conclusion until he pushed his effort. Woof. That's two three-putts and two short misses on the greens for Tiger today. He remains at one under. Meanwhile, Rory McIlroy, after getting to two under through eight, has fallen to one over after back-to-back bogeys. Justin Thomas, the third player in the group, continues to lead this trio at three under.3:05: After hitting fade after fade, Woods steps to the 13th tee and rips a draw around the corner, perfectly setting up his next shot. Good to see him working it both ways with ease.3:01: Tiger pushed his tee shot into the right rough, then hit a fantastic recovery shot from a thick lie onto the green. He had a long look at birdie that rolled about four feet past, leaving him with a tricky left-to-right par putt, which he missed. That's three three putts on the day for Woods, and he's still one under.2:39: Not the best chip from Woods, as he left himself about six feet for birdie, but he makes it anyway. Four straight for Tiger to get to two under for the day.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10964952191957975042:30: Woods rips a 3-wood from 269 to just in front of the green. Hate to jinx him, but there's no reason he shouldn't easily make his fourth straight birdie here (ducks).2:20: Three in a row for Woods as he rolls in another at No. 10 and moves to one under. If he finds the fairway again at the 11th, four in a row will be in his sights. Meanwhile, Rory makes his par to stay at one under and JT ends up holing his 10 footer for birdie to get to four under. Finally a little bit of JUICE from this threesome.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096489287753711616https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096489787672780800By the way, it looks like we know when they'll be heading back out for round two later today. Here's an update from the Tiger Tracker:https://twitter.com/GCTigerTracker/status/1096481806067523585That should give them enough time to get at least 11 or 12 holes in.At the 11th, Woods stripes another drive down the fairway. He's really starting to cook.2:12: Tiger's shot was a tad more difficult than we thought, as he had to avoid a bunker and take it up high to get it back to the pin. He was successful, sticking it to about three feet. Hell of a shot. Even better was Rory's shot, as he flopped it from a nice lie and got it to hang on just off the back of the green and stay out of the back bunker. Thomas, who had the easiest shot, put too much spin on his chip, leaving himself with about 10 feet for birdie.2:07: Finally, Tiger, Rory and JT hit their tee shots, and it looks like the ensuing entertainment will be well worth the wait. Tiger is in the collection area left of the green, where he has a straightforward chip that should set him up with a good chance to make birdie. Thomas is just in front of the green, and he'll have a great chance to make a birdie as well. Rory ... um ... not so much. He's in the rough with a greenside bunker in front of him and a pin he won't be able to get close to, and just holding the green would be a miracle.1:52: Woods drains his four-footer for bird and turns in even par 35. Real strong finish to his opening nine, and now it looks like he'll have a long wait at the 10th. DeChambeau, Kuchar and Rahm have still yet to hit their tee shots.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10964831254067896321:47: Tiger had just 122 left to the green and stuck one in there close. He has four feet left for birdie to turn in even par, which would be a small victory after that ugly three putt back at No. 7. Not to mention he'll have a prime opportunity to get into red figures at the driveable par-4 10th.1:41: Woods cranks another high fade right down the middle with the driver at No. 9. With the tees up today, he'll have a low iron in his hand for his approach.1:34: And he's on the board! Woods bounces back with a birdie putt from 15 feet, getting him back to one over. We'll see if that gets him going before making the turn.1:30: From 125 yards out, Woods hit a wedge and hated it from the second he made contact. While he did pull it, he's still hole high and inside 20 feet. Hideki Matsuyama-esque move from Tiger.1:24: Woods rips one right down the middle at the par-4 eighth. Should have a short iron in.1:15: Tiger's birdie putt was actually from just off the green on the fringe, and he rolled it by some four feet. Then, he missed the comebacker for par, dropping to two over on the day. Oof.1:09: Fairway and a green for Woods at the seventh. Good look at birdie coming up to get back to level par.12:58: Another hole, another par for Woods, who two-putted from 24 feet on the par-3 sixth. In the group up ahead, though, Jon Rahm is making a move at three under through six.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/109646557828021452912:47: Another meh hole for Tiger on No. 5, just missing the fairway with his tee shot, finding the front of the green with a so-so approach, and two-putting for another par from 43 feet. Woods remains at one over through five holes while his playing partners, McIlroy and Thomas, both remain at one under.12:42: As Matt Kuchar's ball is in the air on the par-3 sixth, a fan yells, \"Go low—just not with the gratuity!\" Despite Matt maintaining this is \"not a story,\" it is. And this won't be the last comment like this.12:29: Woods hit a nice shot to about 15 feet on the par-3 fourth, but ran his birdie effort by the hole. Still one over. Still no highlights. At least, from Tiger. Here was Spieth's closing birdie from about an hour ago, because there is not much else exciting going on right now.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/109644546143346688112:17: Another missed fairway and another short approach from Tiger on the par-4 third. Although, Woods found the putting surface, he was unable to two-putt from 63 feet, missing a seven-footer for par after badly misreading his first putt. That drops Tiger to one over through three holes. Not a lot of highlights so far. . .12:02: Tiger misses right off the tee on No. 2 then comes up short on another approach. But his pitch shot nearly goes down, leaving him with a tap-in par. Even par through two holes.11:49: After that perfect opening tee shot, Tiger hit a hideous approach with a 5-iron that came up way short in a fairway bunker. From there, he hit his third to 10 feet but missed the putt to walk away with a disappointing par. Both of Tiger's playing partners, McIlroy and Thomas, make birdie.11:38: Matt Kuchar just misses his eagle attempt from 25 feet on No. 1, but taps in for birdie. Kuchar has been in the news a lot this week over a caddie controversy dating back to his win at the Mayakoba Golf Classic. A controversy he didn't help with his comments on Wednesday. Is it possible some of those \"Kuuuuch\" shouts will turn to \"Mooooch\"? Kinda sounded like it on the first hole. . .11:34: Jordan Spieth is in with a seven-under-par 64 to take the early lead. Spieth needed only 21 putts during his bogey-free round. Of course, starting tournaments hasn't been a problem for Spieth of late. Finishing, however, has been a different story. Incredibly, Spieth is looking for his first win since the 2017 British Open and his first top 5 since last year's Masters.11:32: Woods smashes a driver off the first tee that finds the fairway. The opening par 5 at Riviera is essentially a long par 4 and one of the easiest holes on the PGA Tour all year so Tiger is thinking at least birdie after that tee shot.10:53: So far, so good on the Friday weather:https://twitter.com/GCTigerTracker/status/1096437235262533632And with lift, clean and place in play (for at least the first round), low scores are out there. Let's set the over/under on the Par-71 layout at 68.5.10:45: We are approximately 45 minutes away from Tiger's tee time and it's another major champ who is already off to a fantastic start. Jordan Spieth has the lead at six under through 15 holes. Spieth leads Patrick Rodgers by one and then there's a big group at four under, including Bill Haas, who is playing in the event a year after being involved in a car accident during last year's tournament that killed a friend he was staying with. Make sure you read Brian Wacker's piece from earlier in the week on how Haas is still trying to move on from that tragedy.10:35: As we move within an hour from Tiger teeing off, check out GOLFTV's latest behind-the-scenes video with Woods in which he says his bag has up to 16(!) golf gloves during rainy rounds and he explains why he doesn't like wearing rain jackets:https://twitter.com/GOLFTV/status/1096246456795697153\"Pops used to say, 'Once you're wet, you're wet. Deal with it.'\" Talk about a great life lesson.WATCH MORE VIDEOS FROM THE LOOPMagic Johnson got the Lakers fined for tweets he sent while holding a ceremonial executive title. Once he started running the front office, his blinking at Paul George on national TV contributed to the Lakers getting fined again for tampering. Johnson’s praise of Giannis Antetokounmpo drew yet another tampering fine.So, though he escaped punishment for his recent comments on 76ers guard Ben Simmons, Johnson refused to answer a question about Hornets guard Kemba Walker.Carolina Blitz:Asked Magic about Kemba and he said y’all aren’t going to catch him slipping anymore. pic.twitter.com/sQZtIWnQbn— Carolina Blitz (@KeepBlitzin) February 15, 2019Johnson:You know I can’t answer any questions about no players, because every time I do it, I get fined. But anybody else do it, they don’t get fined. So I’m going to stay away from that one.I don’t blame Johnson for feeling that way.Other teams’ owners, coaches and executives have repeatedly publicly discussed rival players without facing announced punishment.To be fair, the NBA doesn’t reveal every fine. Bucks owner Marc Lasry reportedly just got fined for tampering, but the league never announced it. But, at minimum, there’s an inconsistency with how the NBA exposes Johnson’s transgressions.Even NBA commissioner Adam Silver said last year there’s a spotlight on the Lakers due to prior tampering. That strikes me as unfair. The Lakers already paid for their prior violations and should now be held to the same standard as everyone else.And for what it’s worth, I wish that standard allowed an all-time great point guard like Johnson to publicly share his thoughts on Kemba Walker.Gareth Bale has landed himself in hot water after La Liga denounced the Real Madrid star for his celebration in the Madrid derby, which could carry a ban of four to 12 games.The Welsh forward scored as a substitute in the 3-1 victory over Atletico Madrid, bringing up his 100th goal for the club.And during the celebrations that followed, Bale \"lifted his right arm near his head in a clear sign of provocation towards the fans, then giving a gesture which could be seen as obscene and disdainful by folding his arm and striking it with his other hand.\"In a statement released by La Liga, Bale’s punishment will be decided by whether he incited the crowd or not.If Bale is guilty of “inciting opposition fans” to cause a hostile reaction, the punishment could carry four to 12 games, if there was no hostile reaction but intent, then it could be as little as one to three games.The gesture is referred to in Spain as ‘corte de mangas,’ with the moment not picked up in the referee’s match report.A committee will now decide whether the gesture merits a punishment.Bale also featured in Real’s Champions League victory over Ajax.Los Blancos take a 2-1 lead back to the Bernabeu for the second leg of the last 16 tie after Marco Asensio’s late winner.\n"

Yahoo Sports' Charles Robinson and Amanda Borges address the settlement between the players and the NFL, and what it means for their continuing efforts to promote social activism.The NBA jerseys of the future have a new feature to them: the ability to customize them after purchase by changing the name and number.In an awkward reveal reminiscent of a tech presentation, NBA commissioner Adam Silver and sportscaster Ahmad Rashad demonstrated the jersey at the NBA Tech Summit on Friday ahead of All-Star Weekend in Charlotte, switching a No. 30 Stephen Curry jersey to No. 23 Michael Jordan threads.Adam Silver just revealed the NBA jersey of the future that changes the name and number 🤯(via @NBA)pic.twitter.com/cgJk7KcIIU— Yahoo Sports (@YahooSports) February 15, 2019If Silver is trying to pull a Steve Jobs, perhaps he should stick to his day job. But in all seriousness, the jersey presents some interesting questions: Will it be easier for fans to “bandwagon”? Can players switch jerseys mid-game? Will Drake be first in line for this new prop?Meanwhile, Twitter had all of the jokes.Jersey cost only 20 easy installments of, $999.99.— Vod Kanockers (@JHoward2716) February 15, 2019Kevin Durant can now switch teams mid game with these new #NBA jerseys 😳 pic.twitter.com/a01rMkiexr— OT Sports Podcast Network (@OTSportsPod) February 15, 2019This could go one of two ways: Either the NBA will have found another way to separate itself from the other sports leagues or it will be a pointless feature that exists just because there is the technology to make it happen and for Twitter to crack jokes. In any case, you have to admit the NBA never fails to entertain.More from Yahoo Sports: • Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight When spring training camps opened this week around Major League Baseball, it brought hope that maybe, finally, Bryce Harper and Manny Machado would sign with teams and baseball’s long free-agent freeze would melt away.Nope. Not yet. Not only has that not happened, something else did happen: a number of talented young players around the league have agreed to team-friendly contract extensions.The latest was New York Yankees ace Luis Severino, who on Friday reportedly agreed to a four-year, $40 million deal. The deal, first reported by Joel Sherman of the New York Post, would buy up Severino’s arbitration years and comes with a $15 million club option for his first year of free agency.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]By agreeing to this deal, the Yankees and Severino avoid arbitration for 2019. He’ll make $4 million this season, $10 million next, then $10.25 million in 2021 and $11 million in 2022. The club option is for 2023. In the grand scheme of society, this is a very generous contract. In baseball’s economic bubble, it’s another young player signing for below-market value relative to his skills and potential.It’s hard to blame Severino for taking the deal, looking around at a free-agent world where Harper and Machado are still available, as are Dallas Keuchel and Craig Kimbrel. Especially since we haven’t heard even slight grumblings about teams being interested in Keuchel and Kimbrel.Coming off a breakout season in which he went 19-8 with a 3.39 ERA, the 25-year-old Severino was given a deal that’s pretty hard to turn down: “Do you want $40 million guaranteed, yes or no?”The other players faced with a similar question this week were Philadelphia Phillies ace Aaron Nola, who said yes to a four-year, $45 million deal Wednesday. It also avoided arbitration and bought out two of Nola’s free agency years, making it the most below-market deal of any of these.The Minnesota Twins locked up two of their talented young players Thursday, as right fielder Max Kepler agreed to a five-year, $35 million deal with a $10 million club option for 2024. It buys out three years of free agency for Kepler, 26. Shortstop Jorge Polanco also agreed to a five-year extension, his is worth $25.75 million with two option years that could keep him in Minnesota through 2025.In a vacuum, these types of extensions look like win-wins: The players get guaranteed money as they’re coming off good seasons. The clubs get cost-certainty to help them navigate the future — whether it’s the Yankees and Phillies trying to add big free agents this year or next, or a team like the Twins striving for contention with a homegrown core.In a bigger sense, though, it’s hard not to look at these deals in the current state of free agency and wonder if they’re a symptom of something else. Is it the market correcting itself? Is it baseball’s economy morphing into something new? Or maybe it’s just players looking around and saying, “Well, I better get my money now.”According to numerous reports, there’s a fear that for this generation of young players the light at the end of the tunnel — the big free-agency payday — won’t be there for them in the same way it was for so many other players.So while it’s great that stars like Justin Verlander, Clayton Kershaw and Max Scherzer are publicly speaking out about the current state of free agency, they’re on the right side of it. They got their mega deals.The younger players find themselves in a different sort of peril. It’s entirely possible that these are the biggest paydays these players ever get, which is a much different economic model that we’ve seen from baseball in the past.Whether it’s right or wrong — and that’s certainly something that’s up for debate heading into the next collective-bargaining agreement — baseball’s economy has often been backward. Players get paid less, relative to the market, in their pre-free agency years. The best recent example is Mike Trout winning the MVP in 2014 at age 22 while making $1 million.He got a raise to $6 million the next season, but in 2015 was still making a fraction of what people like Ryan Howard ($25M), Albert Pujols ($24M), Joe Mauer ($23M), Mark Teixeira ($22.5M) and Jose Reyes ($22M) were making.But that overpay is a necessary part baseball’s economic ecosystem too. It’s a fact: Players get overpaid as their careers decline. It’s almost like baseball’s way of making up for underpaying players during their early years. It’s baseball’s golden parachute. What’s happening these days is fewer teams are accepting that overpay as part of the how the system works.In the past few years, arbitration salaries have gotten higher and higher, and teams have tried harder to lock up younger stars before free agency. It’s why we’ve see players like Madison Bumgarner, Chris Archer, Chris Sale and Paul Goldschmidt become valuable trade chips for their team-friendly contract extensions.Teams are getting smarter about where their money goes, and how to keep value in their assets. These extensions to Severino, Nola and the rest show that they’re willing to spend money, just in the way that they want.Earlier this week, former Miami Marlins president David Samson tweeted something in response to Justin Verlander, saying the “broken system” talk was wrong. Players and their agents, Samson said, needed to adjust to a “new reality.”He may be right about the new reality part. The monster paydays at the end of the free agency tunnel could be fading away. If Bryce Harper and Manny Machado can’t get them, who can?The new reality could be players seizing their money. Whenever they can.– – – – – –Mike Oz is a writer at Yahoo Sports.

However, Wainwright framed the situation with a little more urgency on Friday by expressing concerns that a day of reckoning could happen sooner than later.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]Speaking to InsideSTL.com’s Tim McKernan, Wainwright said it was inevitable that the players will go on strike unless major changes are made to help bridge the widening gap. But he’s also worried that frustrations could reach a boiling point during the season leading to some form of a revolt. Perhaps even a mid-season walkout.#STLCards pitcher Adam Wainwright on @TMASTL: “Unless something changes, there’s going to be a strike. 100%. I’m just worried people are going to walk-out mid-season.” pic.twitter.com/M8WeRVcASe— Tim McKernan (@tmckernan) February 15, 2019“Unless something changes, there’s going to be a strike. 100%,” Wainwright said regarding the free-agent freeze that has left stars like Bryce Harper and Manny Machado without contracts. “I’m just worried people are going to walkout midseason.”It’s conceivable given the current climate, but a players revolt on that level still feels like a long shot. The target date we should all still be looking at is Dec. 1, 2021. That’s when the current collective bargaining agreement ends and the owners will be forced to come to the table.That doesn’t mean we should just dismiss Wainwright’s concerns about a 2019 strike. While they might feel a little on the dramatic side, the frustration that has built all offseason as dozens of free agents, including and especially Harper and Machado, remain unsigned is becoming more palpable by the day. There’s a genuine feeling that owners are determined to cut back on salaries even as profits continue to reach new heights, it’s possible the players’ patience will run out if the free-agent freeze continues to drag on. Wainwright thinks so, and he’s far from alone.In Friday’s interview, the 37-year-old right-hander also criticized owners and front offense personnel for placing too much emphasis on “analytics” and placing everything in a “sabermetric box” that discounts intangibles and other immeasurable aspects of baseball.Adam Wainwright said today on ⁦@TMASTL⁩ that he expects there to be a strike “100%.”The context of the conversation comes from a discussion on how Bryce Harper and Manny Machado are still without teams.You can see Wainwright’s reasoning in the video below. pic.twitter.com/GXsmx4cXk1— Tim McKernan (@tmckernan) February 15, 2019Wainwright admitted that there’s always risk in making long-term financial commitments to players, but emphasized that doing so marks a commitment to winning that several teams seemingly lack.“Part of it is smart from their side of it, but you have to realize it’s about winning. So, if Bryce Harper wants 10 years and he’s 26 years old. He’s going to be a dynamic player. The same can be said about Manny Machado. These guys are superstar players.”The deeper we get into it the more obvious it is that the players know what battles lie ahead. The only real question is how much worse it will get before any progress is made toward a satisfactory resolution.More from Yahoo Sports:• Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight MLB rumors: Bryce Harper has made his decision, says D.C. radio host originally appeared on nbcsportsbayarea.comA report has come out from the East Coast saying Bryce Harper has come to a decision on which team he will play for in 2019 and beyond.Chris Russell, a sports radio talk show host from 106.7 The Fan in Washington D.C., (who has been on the Harper beat for some time) said the free agent slugger could make a decision in the next 24 hours.\"Maybe I took a little bit of a leap of faith here based on some indications I got from a real good source,\" Russell told 94WIP, in Philadelphia, on Friday.\"Bryce and his representatives, (Scott) Boras, his people, his wife Kayla, they've been meeting since Monday morning in Vegas. Bryce originally wanted this done, when it took this long, by Valentine's Day. Obviously, the contract has not been announced, signed, or whatever.\"\"But I'm led to believe by the people that I've talked to that are close to the situation -- and I have, again, a real good source that has helped me through this process, let's just leave it at that,\" Russell said. \"That Bryce was in a mood to celebrate yesterday. Now, the source said, 'I believe it's done.' I don't have concrete, 100 percent proof for you guys. I wish I did, otherwise, I would have it and I would be running around with it. But I don't have that, so I want to caution everybody in Philadelphia. But that's what I was led to believe, that this thing is now decided.\"Russell then mentioned the Phillies.\"Now, what comes then is hammering out a contract. And if we were to believe the report that the Philadelphia Phillies had not even extended a formal offer -- and I assume that to be a termed, written agreement, that type of thing, which I find hard to believe -- then there might be more legwork to this. And therefore, hey the decision may be done, but the contract still needs to be ironed out.\"[RELATED: Phillies fan participates in \"lent\" in hopes of recruiting Harper]Russell is being safe with the terminology he's using, which is understandable. And while we haven't been able to confirm these rumors, Harper, along with many other free agents, remains unsigned.The Giants appeared to be the \"mystery team\" that introduced themselves late into the Harper sweepstakes -- and when the radio hosts asked Russell his opinion on where the outfielder will end up next season, he believed Harper will be in an orange and black uniform.\"I don't think it's going to be the Nationals,\" Russell said. \"I think it's going to be the San Francisco Giants, but that is not by any means an 'I know that for a fact,' so I want to caution everybody -- I know how this works -- I get in trouble with everything I say on my radio show, and everyone blows it up.\" The wait continues ... Golden State Warriors stars Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant empathised with Steve Kerr after the head coach was ejected during the loss to the Portland Trail Blazers having thrown a clipboard in response to a flagrant foul call.Kerr was enraged late in the fourth quarter when Draymond Green was called for a flagrant foul after he stopped Zach Collins from approaching the rim as he went up for a shot.That drew Kerr's ire and after ranting in one referee's face, he slammed a clipboard down to earn an ejection, with Durant having to escort his head coach back off the court.The Warriors lost the game 129-107 but will still head into the All-Star break with the best record in the Western Conference.\"It was an emotional game. We fought really hard for 43 minutes,\" Curry told reporters afterwards.\"One questionable decision - the flagrant - obviously the fire came out. You see coach go and throw a clipboard. At that point you try to get us over the hump. An eight-point swing, it's tough to overcome.\"\"I looked at the replay and the amount of ball [Green] got, there was nothing excessive about it, he got all the ball.\"There was a lot of chirping, with Zach involved. There was probably a sensitivity to it, trying to put out some fires, but I thought it was a terrible call. We obviously paid the price for it with how everything unfolded after that.\"Durant shared that sympathy having been the one to pull Kerr away from the referees as he continued to rant at them.\"I felt for him, I understand his anger and his rage, especially for that call,\" he said.\"I thought we should have just kept playing, It was a common foul, I thought. Refs looked at it differently. \"I understand why coach was a little frustrated.\"Kerr explained that it was the disbelief at the call that had triggered his reaction.\"I was just shocked that that was called a flagrant foul,\" he said. \"I'm not sure how it's determined - if it's in New York or the officials on the call - but that was head-scratching: that that could be called a flagrant foul.\"The guy's going to go in for a dunk, you've got to make sure he doesn't dunk it.\"So, I told Kenny [Mauer] that I beg to differ. There might have been a couple of other words in there too!\"I'll have to ask the owner if the clipboard broke when I threw it down. I got a little anger out so that was good. I was too busy yelling to ask for an explanation.\"Charles Barkley thinks New Orleans Pelicans star Anthony Davis made a mistake with his trade request.The 25-year-old asked the Pelicans to move him in late January and the Los Angeles Lakers had been engaged in discussions about acquiring him. But, no deal was reached before the deadline and Davis remained with New Orleans.Barkley, an 11-time All-Star who works as an analyst for TNT, said he thinks Davis and his agent, Rich Paul, mishandled the situation.\"Don't ruin your reputation as a great player, one of the nicest guys in the world,\" Barkley told reporters on Thursday ahead of All-Star weekend (via the Washington Post).\"Remember, your agent works for you, you don't work for him. They handled that situation wrong. It's going to come back to bite them in the a***. It's unfortunate.\"The six-time All-Star entered play on Thursday averaging 28.5 points and 13.1 rebounds this season. But, he scored just three points in 24 minutes on the floor in the Pelicans' 118-88 loss to the Orlando Magic earlier this week.\"This is a bad situation,\" Barkley said. \"It's a bad look for the NBA. Because that kid can't go out there and give 100 per cent because he’s worried about getting hurt. The guy's the second-best player in the world and he's got three points? That's not a good look for the NBA.\"The Boston Celtics and New York Knicks, among others, are expected to explore dealing for Davis after the season. Barkley, however, said he believes the forward will eventually land in Los Angeles because of Paul's relationship with Lakers star LeBron James.Barkley tallied 22.1 points and 11.7 rebounds per game over his 16-year career. He retired in 2000 and was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame six years later.After an apology from Sergio Garcia, a non-apology from Matt Kuchar, and an uncooperative Mother Nature on Valentine's Day, it's time for everyone to focus again on Tiger Woods. Kidding. Sort of. A weather-delayed first round at Riviera re-starts on Friday morning and the 14-time major champ will be in the Hollywood-area spotlight as he finally begins his Genesis Open. And golf fans could potentially see a LOT of the tournament host as the event tries to play catch up after heavy rains on Thursday.Woods, Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas (Decent group, eh?) are scheduled to tee off at 8:32 local time (11:32 ET). The hope is they will complete their first rounds and then play as much of their second rounds as possible before darkness. And Tiger's hope is to finally win for the first time at this historic layout where he missed the cut last year. We'll be tracking Tiger every step of the way so keep it right here for the latest scores, news and highlights. (All times eastern)SATURDAY, 11:25: With a 25-foot birdie putt on No. 9, Woods' final hole of the second round, Tiger will likely make the cut. The birdie brought Woods back to even on his round and to one under overall.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096808527694245890After resuming play in the morning, Woods bogeyed his first hole, No. 4, then made four pars before his finishing birdie. His playing partners, however, fared much better. Justin Thomas shares the lead with Adam Scott at 11 under and Rory McIlroy birdied four of his six holes on Saturday morning to shoot 63 and move to seven under through 36 holes. Thursday's early wave is now on the course for their second rounds.-------------------FRIDAY-------------------8:25: And with that, the horn has sounded—play will be suspended for darkness on Friday at Riviera. Tiger, JT and Rory have six more holes to complete their second round. Justin Thomas is at 10-under, tied with Adam Scott for the lead. Tiger will hope Saturday brings some different momentum for him—as this marathon day ends with two bogeys in a row after the highlight eagle.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10965708926692065298:21: That's back-to-back bogeys now for Tiger Woods, dropping another shot here at the third hole (his 12th of the round). And over his past six holes, Tiger has four bogeys. The birdie at No. 1 helped negate most of that damage ... but Tiger's back to 1-under again—right on the current cut line.8:13: On his 30th hole of the day, Tiger is showing some obvious signs of being tired. And who could blame him—he's been playing golf for nearly 10 hours straight. From 165 yards out at the third hole, Tiger Woods tries to chop out a 6-iron and comes out of it. His ball comes to rest short of the green. With sunset in Pacific Palisades being 5:30 local time, this group will have time for maybe one more hole today.8:04: Tiger follows up that eagle putt at No. 1 with a bogey at the second hole. The third bogey of his second round moves Tiger back to 2-under overall.7:56: After a long wait at the second hole, Tiger sprays his second shot from 235 out with a fairway wood out to the right. He'll have his work cut out from the front right bunker to save par at the 482-yard par 4.7:40: This is exactly what Tiger Woods needed: He rolls in his 43-foot eagle putt at his 10th hole (the first) to get back to 3-under—negating those two bogeys he made on his front nine. What a putt! With the flagstick in!https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096570892669206529Tiger made a disappointing par to open his first round earlier today at the first hole. The unlikely eagle makes up for that effort—and could turn around Tiger's second round in a dramatic way. Tiger goes from toeing the cut line at 1-under to now all of a sudden being T-21.7:28: Tiger finds the fairway at the par-5 first hole, the group's 10th hole of their second round, as he attempts to get a shot back here after bogeying two of his final three holes on his front nine. Neither bogey was particularly bad—the 18th hole is playing brutally tough right now uphill and into the wind with the rain, making it even more of a challenging hole. And his break at 16 was very unlucky.7:16: Tiger and JT are gonna have their work cut out to save par at the 18th hole (their ninth). Each player had fairway wood approaches and tried playing a big cut. JT was way up left on the hill—Tiger was closer. He went high with his approach and will have about 11 feet left for par.Tiger misses the par putt, so he'll drop a shot along with JT as they make the turn. Tiger moves back to 1-under after 27 holes. That's where the cut line currently is—so all of a sudden, Tiger must be concerned about making the cut.7:01: Following Justin Thomas throwing a dart at the 17th to about 3 feet, Tiger puts his wedge shot from under 100 yards to outside 20 feet, so he'll be disappointed with that effort. The birdie putt misses on the high side, and Tiger taps in for par to remain at 2-under. His playing partner and buddy Justin Thomas stays hot, rolling in a fourth straight birdie to get to 9-under—tied for the lead with Adam Scott. Really impressive golf here from JT.6:54: The rain is really coming down now as the players head to the 17th hole. Tiger finds the fairway at the par-5 17th hole, but it was a short one—he has 326 yards left. Most players have been laying up at this par 5 all day.6:43: From a brutal position up against the back lip of the bunker, Tiger hacks it out—and somehow keeps the ball on the green, albeit the back portion. His par attempt from 44 feet away here comes up three feet shy. Tiger makes his bogey to move back to 2-under.Meanwhile, Justin Thomas is officially on fire. He has another birdie after a fabulous tee shot at 16. It's now two Kentucky boys tied at the top: Justin Thomas and J.B. Holmes (-8).https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10965576791939317766:39: Tiger will have serious lie issues at the par-3 16th hole. His tee shot came to rest up against the back lip of the bunker. As Billy Kratzert just remarked on PGA Tour Live, Tiger will do well just to keep this ball on the green. Though he avoided dropping a shot on his last hole, there might be a bogey in his future here.6:35: A clutchhh par save by Tiger at the 15th hole makes up for his poor chip—and Tiger keeps the momentum going on his second round, as he stays 3-under for the tournament and 2-under on the round.Justin Thomas, also in Tiger's group, holed out from in front of the green for birdie at the 14th hole, and he makes a long birdie putt at 15 to get to 7-under—just one back of fellow Kentucky native J.B. Holmes.6:32: A poor chip shot from Tiger at the 15th hole leaves him about 13 feet away. He'll need to convert that putt to prevent dropping his first shot of his second round.6:24: Tiger finds another fairway here at Riviera, this one at the 15th hole. The guy is feeeling it with his driver. Almost on auto pilot. His approach from 190 out turns a little too much, finding the rough to the left of the green. He'll have to get up and down to avoid dropping one here.6:20: From 20 feet out, Tiger's birdie bid comes up shy—never really scaring the hole, despite getting a good look at the line from Rory's putt. Tiger taps in for par to remain at 3-under.The putter has been disappointing for Tiger all day: He had 34 putts in his first round, including four three-putts, just the third time in his career he's done that.6:13: Tiger puts his tee shot at the par-3 14th hole just inside Rory's ball—about 20 feet right of the hole. He'll get a little teach from Rory's putt, too, as Tiger continues to hit it well today.6:07: Tiger just misses the left-to-right curling bid for birdie, leaving himself with an easy par at 13. He stays 3-under for the tournament and -2 through four on his round.Tiger's playing partners are also playing well—Rory has three birdies in his first four holes to get to 2-under. Look out for Rory at rainy Riviera. And Justin Thomas, despite hitting his tee shot out of bounds at 13, got up and down from 160 yards to avoid dropping multiple shots. He's now 5-under after that bogey.6:02: Another grooved tee shot for Tiger Woods at the 13th hole puts him in good position. He turned over his tee shot—putting his draw in the middle of the fairway at the dogleg left. Tiger spins his approach back to about 15 feet, just off the green in the fringe. He'll have a chance to knock another one here and keep the momentum going.5:51: Bang! Tiger nails the 25-footer for birdie at the 12th hole to add a second birdie to his card through three holes. Realistically, too, it could be three straight birdies for Tiger. But the 14-time major champion is now 2-under through 3—T-3 for the tournament (T-19)—and carries some strong momentum on his side at the start of his second round ... as the rain is coming down at Riviera.5:46: Tiger hits his approach hole high—about 25 feet from 181 yards. He'll have another chance to add a birdie to his third round.Tiger's currently at 2-under, which puts him at T-29. The projected cut is at 1-under—so he's comfortably inside the number as of now. But there's a ton of golf to be played, obviously.5:41: Tiger finds the fairway with his driver at the par-4 12th hole. The 12th usually plays as one of the toughest holes at Riviera—we'll see if Tiger can take advantage of his position here in the fairway.5:33: An excellent fairway-wood second shot by Tiger put him right in front of the par-5 11th green in two. But a very poor approach putt for his third leaves him more than 10 feet away. His birdie try slides by for a very disappointing par being so close in 2. That should've been a golden opportunity to start his second round with two birdies—instead, Tiger stays at 2-under.5:12: Tiger goes high with his pitch—having to navigate around the front bunker, and plays it nicely—spinning it about 7 feet short of the hole. So Tiger will have a good look for an opening birdie to start his second round. Tiger converts the birdie putt to move to 2-under.5:02: Only a little more than a half hour after finishing his first round, Tiger Woods (-1) -- along with Justin Thomas (-5) and Rory McIlroy (+1) -- has teed off in his second round. The group started on the drivable 10th hole, and Tiger has driven his tee shot just off the green. He'll have a chance to put his pitch shot close to start his second round with a birdie.4:24: Tiger narrowly misses the birdie putt at the 18th hole, so he'll tap in for a par and an opening-round, one-under 70 at Riviera. Having three-putted for a fourth time on the 17th hole to drop a shot in disappointing fashion, Tiger will head to his second round a bit frustrated. But the four consecutive birdies showed him being able to score well at Riviera, where he has never won.Tiger, JT (who birdied 18 to finish at 5-under) and Rory will head right back for their second round in this marathon day for them.4:18: Tiger responds to that shocking three-putt with a perfect drive and a towering 6-iron on Riviera's famed 18th. Woods is in good shape to at least make par the difficult hole, but as we've seen all day, a two-putt is anything but automatic.Here's an unusual stat on Tiger three-putting four times this afternoon. He's making some history in a bad way...https://twitter.com/JustinRayGolf/status/10965196250582507574:06: So much for the momentum. . . After a decent approach shot that spins back to about 20 feet, Woods runs his birdie putt a couple feet by and. . . gulp. . . misses the comebacker from about two feet. Wow. That's four three-putts on the day as Tiger falls back to one under with one hole to play.3:57: Uh-oh, it's raining in southern California again. Meanwhile, Woods is plodding his way up the par-5 17th. After pulling his drive into the left rough and drawing a poor lie, Woods pushed his layup slightly into the first cut of the right rough. He'll have a some sort of wedge to a back-right hole location.3:50: Tiger's tee shot was tracking on the par-3 16th, but it comes up about 30 feet short. From there, he two-putts for par to remain at two under. Justin Thomas makes his 10-foot birdie effort to move to four under, while Rory McIlroy remains at one over. McIlroy hast two holes to avert his first over-par score of 2019.3:40: After another great drive and a solid approach, Woods races his birdie attempt nearly five feet past the hole. But he keeps the overall positive momentum going by converting the par putt to remain at two under. Tiger has three more holes to play. At least, before he gets a lunch break.3:24: BANG! There's the bounce back from Tiger. It just came one hole later. And from farther away as Woods drains his 12-footer for birdie on No. 14.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096507996031467520Woods is now back to two under, five shots behind Jordan Spieth, who has to be pleased to still be in front by two despite these soft conditions.3:17: Tiger hits a great shot on the difficult par-3 14th hole to about 15 feet. He'll have a good look at birdie coming up. In the meantime, here's a look at how the leader board stands with Jordan Spieth still leading the way.Jordan Spieth (-7) 2t. Tony Finau (-5) 2t. Patrick Rodgers (-5) 2t. Kramer Hickok (-5) 2t. Davis Love III (-5) 2t. Adam Scott (-5) 2t. J.B. Homes (-5)Click here for full scores.3:13: Woods stuck his approach to about four feet below the hole on No. 13. A bounce back birdie looked like a forgone conclusion until he pushed his effort. Woof. That's two three-putts and two short misses on the greens for Tiger today. He remains at one under. Meanwhile, Rory McIlroy, after getting to two under through eight, has fallen to one over after back-to-back bogeys. Justin Thomas, the third player in the group, continues to lead this trio at three under.3:05: After hitting fade after fade, Woods steps to the 13th tee and rips a draw around the corner, perfectly setting up his next shot. Good to see him working it both ways with ease.3:01: Tiger pushed his tee shot into the right rough, then hit a fantastic recovery shot from a thick lie onto the green. He had a long look at birdie that rolled about four feet past, leaving him with a tricky left-to-right par putt, which he missed. That's three three putts on the day for Woods, and he's still one under.2:39: Not the best chip from Woods, as he left himself about six feet for birdie, but he makes it anyway. Four straight for Tiger to get to two under for the day.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10964952191957975042:30: Woods rips a 3-wood from 269 to just in front of the green. Hate to jinx him, but there's no reason he shouldn't easily make his fourth straight birdie here (ducks).2:20: Three in a row for Woods as he rolls in another at No. 10 and moves to one under. If he finds the fairway again at the 11th, four in a row will be in his sights. Meanwhile, Rory makes his par to stay at one under and JT ends up holing his 10 footer for birdie to get to four under. Finally a little bit of JUICE from this threesome.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096489287753711616https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096489787672780800By the way, it looks like we know when they'll be heading back out for round two later today. Here's an update from the Tiger Tracker:https://twitter.com/GCTigerTracker/status/1096481806067523585That should give them enough time to get at least 11 or 12 holes in.At the 11th, Woods stripes another drive down the fairway. He's really starting to cook.2:12: Tiger's shot was a tad more difficult than we thought, as he had to avoid a bunker and take it up high to get it back to the pin. He was successful, sticking it to about three feet. Hell of a shot. Even better was Rory's shot, as he flopped it from a nice lie and got it to hang on just off the back of the green and stay out of the back bunker. Thomas, who had the easiest shot, put too much spin on his chip, leaving himself with about 10 feet for birdie.2:07: Finally, Tiger, Rory and JT hit their tee shots, and it looks like the ensuing entertainment will be well worth the wait. Tiger is in the collection area left of the green, where he has a straightforward chip that should set him up with a good chance to make birdie. Thomas is just in front of the green, and he'll have a great chance to make a birdie as well. Rory ... um ... not so much. He's in the rough with a greenside bunker in front of him and a pin he won't be able to get close to, and just holding the green would be a miracle.1:52: Woods drains his four-footer for bird and turns in even par 35. Real strong finish to his opening nine, and now it looks like he'll have a long wait at the 10th. DeChambeau, Kuchar and Rahm have still yet to hit their tee shots.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10964831254067896321:47: Tiger had just 122 left to the green and stuck one in there close. He has four feet left for birdie to turn in even par, which would be a small victory after that ugly three putt back at No. 7. Not to mention he'll have a prime opportunity to get into red figures at the driveable par-4 10th.1:41: Woods cranks another high fade right down the middle with the driver at No. 9. With the tees up today, he'll have a low iron in his hand for his approach.1:34: And he's on the board! Woods bounces back with a birdie putt from 15 feet, getting him back to one over. We'll see if that gets him going before making the turn.1:30: From 125 yards out, Woods hit a wedge and hated it from the second he made contact. While he did pull it, he's still hole high and inside 20 feet. Hideki Matsuyama-esque move from Tiger.1:24: Woods rips one right down the middle at the par-4 eighth. Should have a short iron in.1:15: Tiger's birdie putt was actually from just off the green on the fringe, and he rolled it by some four feet. Then, he missed the comebacker for par, dropping to two over on the day. Oof.1:09: Fairway and a green for Woods at the seventh. Good look at birdie coming up to get back to level par.12:58: Another hole, another par for Woods, who two-putted from 24 feet on the par-3 sixth. In the group up ahead, though, Jon Rahm is making a move at three under through six.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/109646557828021452912:47: Another meh hole for Tiger on No. 5, just missing the fairway with his tee shot, finding the front of the green with a so-so approach, and two-putting for another par from 43 feet. Woods remains at one over through five holes while his playing partners, McIlroy and Thomas, both remain at one under.12:42: As Matt Kuchar's ball is in the air on the par-3 sixth, a fan yells, \"Go low—just not with the gratuity!\" Despite Matt maintaining this is \"not a story,\" it is. And this won't be the last comment like this.12:29: Woods hit a nice shot to about 15 feet on the par-3 fourth, but ran his birdie effort by the hole. Still one over. Still no highlights. At least, from Tiger. Here was Spieth's closing birdie from about an hour ago, because there is not much else exciting going on right now.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/109644546143346688112:17: Another missed fairway and another short approach from Tiger on the par-4 third. Although, Woods found the putting surface, he was unable to two-putt from 63 feet, missing a seven-footer for par after badly misreading his first putt. That drops Tiger to one over through three holes. Not a lot of highlights so far. . .12:02: Tiger misses right off the tee on No. 2 then comes up short on another approach. But his pitch shot nearly goes down, leaving him with a tap-in par. Even par through two holes.11:49: After that perfect opening tee shot, Tiger hit a hideous approach with a 5-iron that came up way short in a fairway bunker. From there, he hit his third to 10 feet but missed the putt to walk away with a disappointing par. Both of Tiger's playing partners, McIlroy and Thomas, make birdie.11:38: Matt Kuchar just misses his eagle attempt from 25 feet on No. 1, but taps in for birdie. Kuchar has been in the news a lot this week over a caddie controversy dating back to his win at the Mayakoba Golf Classic. A controversy he didn't help with his comments on Wednesday. Is it possible some of those \"Kuuuuch\" shouts will turn to \"Mooooch\"? Kinda sounded like it on the first hole. . .11:34: Jordan Spieth is in with a seven-under-par 64 to take the early lead. Spieth needed only 21 putts during his bogey-free round. Of course, starting tournaments hasn't been a problem for Spieth of late. Finishing, however, has been a different story. Incredibly, Spieth is looking for his first win since the 2017 British Open and his first top 5 since last year's Masters.11:32: Woods smashes a driver off the first tee that finds the fairway. The opening par 5 at Riviera is essentially a long par 4 and one of the easiest holes on the PGA Tour all year so Tiger is thinking at least birdie after that tee shot.10:53: So far, so good on the Friday weather:https://twitter.com/GCTigerTracker/status/1096437235262533632And with lift, clean and place in play (for at least the first round), low scores are out there. Let's set the over/under on the Par-71 layout at 68.5.10:45: We are approximately 45 minutes away from Tiger's tee time and it's another major champ who is already off to a fantastic start. Jordan Spieth has the lead at six under through 15 holes. Spieth leads Patrick Rodgers by one and then there's a big group at four under, including Bill Haas, who is playing in the event a year after being involved in a car accident during last year's tournament that killed a friend he was staying with. Make sure you read Brian Wacker's piece from earlier in the week on how Haas is still trying to move on from that tragedy.10:35: As we move within an hour from Tiger teeing off, check out GOLFTV's latest behind-the-scenes video with Woods in which he says his bag has up to 16(!) golf gloves during rainy rounds and he explains why he doesn't like wearing rain jackets:https://twitter.com/GOLFTV/status/1096246456795697153\"Pops used to say, 'Once you're wet, you're wet.

Once he started running the front office, his blinking at Paul George on national TV contributed to the Lakers getting fined again for tampering. Johnson’s praise of Giannis Antetokounmpo drew yet another tampering fine.So, though he escaped punishment for his recent comments on 76ers guard Ben Simmons, Johnson refused to answer a question about Hornets guard Kemba Walker.Carolina Blitz:Asked Magic about Kemba and he said y’all aren’t going to catch him slipping anymore. pic.twitter.com/sQZtIWnQbn— Carolina Blitz (@KeepBlitzin) February 15, 2019Johnson:You know I can’t answer any questions about no players, because every time I do it, I get fined. But anybody else do it, they don’t get fined. So I’m going to stay away from that one.I don’t blame Johnson for feeling that way.Other teams’ owners, coaches and executives have repeatedly publicly discussed rival players without facing announced punishment.To be fair, the NBA doesn’t reveal every fine. Bucks owner Marc Lasry reportedly just got fined for tampering, but the league never announced it. But, at minimum, there’s an inconsistency with how the NBA exposes Johnson’s transgressions.Even NBA commissioner Adam Silver said last year there’s a spotlight on the Lakers due to prior tampering. That strikes me as unfair. The Lakers already paid for their prior violations and should now be held to the same standard as everyone else.And for what it’s worth, I wish that standard allowed an all-time great point guard like Johnson to publicly share his thoughts on Kemba Walker.Gareth Bale has landed himself in hot water after La Liga denounced the Real Madrid star for his celebration in the Madrid derby, which could carry a ban of four to 12 games.The Welsh forward scored as a substitute in the 3-1 victory over Atletico Madrid, bringing up his 100th goal for the club.And during the celebrations that followed, Bale \"lifted his right arm near his head in a clear sign of provocation towards the fans, then giving a gesture which could be seen as obscene and disdainful by folding his arm and striking it with his other hand.\"In a statement released by La Liga, Bale’s punishment will be decided by whether he incited the crowd or not.If Bale is guilty of “inciting opposition fans” to cause a hostile reaction, the punishment could carry four to 12 games, if there was no hostile reaction but intent, then it could be as little as one to three games.The gesture is referred to in Spain as ‘corte de mangas,’ with the moment not picked up in the referee’s match report.A committee will now decide whether the gesture merits a punishment.Bale also featured in Real’s Champions League victory over Ajax.Los Blancos take a 2-1 lead back to the Bernabeu for the second leg of the last 16 tie after Marco Asensio’s late winner.Earlier this week Heisman Trophy winner — and first round draft pick of the Oakland Athletics — Kyler Murray chose football over baseball, committing himself to the NFL draft. It was a move that, however sensible from Murray’s point of view, has led to a lot of soul-searching among baseball folks and has raised questions about what the sport offers young, talented athletes with other options.It’s not that bleak, however! Another outstanding college football player said no to football this week and reaffirmed his commitment to baseball. Tim Tebow! From PFT:One Florida Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback will not be coaching another in the Alliance of American Football.Steve Spurrier, the Florida Heisman winner who later coached the Gators to a national championship and is now head coach of the AAF’s Orlando Apollos, said this morning on PFT Live that after the AAF briefly reached out to Tebow in the ball, it became clear that Tebow’s focus is on playing baseball.Ok, so maybe Tebow is not turning down quite the football opportunity that Murray would’ve been. But take your victories where you can get them, baseball.Follow @craigcalcaterra\n"

In any case, you have to admit the NBA never fails to entertain.More from Yahoo Sports: • Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight When spring training camps opened this week around Major League Baseball, it brought hope that maybe, finally, Bryce Harper and Manny Machado would sign with teams and baseball’s long free-agent freeze would melt away.Nope. Not yet. Not only has that not happened, something else did happen: a number of talented young players around the league have agreed to team-friendly contract extensions.The latest was New York Yankees ace Luis Severino, who on Friday reportedly agreed to a four-year, $40 million deal. The deal, first reported by Joel Sherman of the New York Post, would buy up Severino’s arbitration years and comes with a $15 million club option for his first year of free agency.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]By agreeing to this deal, the Yankees and Severino avoid arbitration for 2019. He’ll make $4 million this season, $10 million next, then $10.25 million in 2021 and $11 million in 2022. The club option is for 2023. In the grand scheme of society, this is a very generous contract. In baseball’s economic bubble, it’s another young player signing for below-market value relative to his skills and potential.It’s hard to blame Severino for taking the deal, looking around at a free-agent world where Harper and Machado are still available, as are Dallas Keuchel and Craig Kimbrel. Especially since we haven’t heard even slight grumblings about teams being interested in Keuchel and Kimbrel.Coming off a breakout season in which he went 19-8 with a 3.39 ERA, the 25-year-old Severino was given a deal that’s pretty hard to turn down: “Do you want $40 million guaranteed, yes or no?”The other players faced with a similar question this week were Philadelphia Phillies ace Aaron Nola, who said yes to a four-year, $45 million deal Wednesday. It also avoided arbitration and bought out two of Nola’s free agency years, making it the most below-market deal of any of these.The Minnesota Twins locked up two of their talented young players Thursday, as right fielder Max Kepler agreed to a five-year, $35 million deal with a $10 million club option for 2024. It buys out three years of free agency for Kepler, 26. Shortstop Jorge Polanco also agreed to a five-year extension, his is worth $25.75 million with two option years that could keep him in Minnesota through 2025.In a vacuum, these types of extensions look like win-wins: The players get guaranteed money as they’re coming off good seasons. The clubs get cost-certainty to help them navigate the future — whether it’s the Yankees and Phillies trying to add big free agents this year or next, or a team like the Twins striving for contention with a homegrown core.In a bigger sense, though, it’s hard not to look at these deals in the current state of free agency and wonder if they’re a symptom of something else. Is it the market correcting itself? Is it baseball’s economy morphing into something new? Or maybe it’s just players looking around and saying, “Well, I better get my money now.”According to numerous reports, there’s a fear that for this generation of young players the light at the end of the tunnel — the big free-agency payday — won’t be there for them in the same way it was for so many other players.So while it’s great that stars like Justin Verlander, Clayton Kershaw and Max Scherzer are publicly speaking out about the current state of free agency, they’re on the right side of it. They got their mega deals.The younger players find themselves in a different sort of peril. It’s entirely possible that these are the biggest paydays these players ever get, which is a much different economic model that we’ve seen from baseball in the past.Whether it’s right or wrong — and that’s certainly something that’s up for debate heading into the next collective-bargaining agreement — baseball’s economy has often been backward. Players get paid less, relative to the market, in their pre-free agency years. The best recent example is Mike Trout winning the MVP in 2014 at age 22 while making $1 million.He got a raise to $6 million the next season, but in 2015 was still making a fraction of what people like Ryan Howard ($25M), Albert Pujols ($24M), Joe Mauer ($23M), Mark Teixeira ($22.5M) and Jose Reyes ($22M) were making.But that overpay is a necessary part baseball’s economic ecosystem too. It’s a fact: Players get overpaid as their careers decline. It’s almost like baseball’s way of making up for underpaying players during their early years. It’s baseball’s golden parachute. What’s happening these days is fewer teams are accepting that overpay as part of the how the system works.In the past few years, arbitration salaries have gotten higher and higher, and teams have tried harder to lock up younger stars before free agency. It’s why we’ve see players like Madison Bumgarner, Chris Archer, Chris Sale and Paul Goldschmidt become valuable trade chips for their team-friendly contract extensions.Teams are getting smarter about where their money goes, and how to keep value in their assets. These extensions to Severino, Nola and the rest show that they’re willing to spend money, just in the way that they want.Earlier this week, former Miami Marlins president David Samson tweeted something in response to Justin Verlander, saying the “broken system” talk was wrong. Players and their agents, Samson said, needed to adjust to a “new reality.”He may be right about the new reality part. The monster paydays at the end of the free agency tunnel could be fading away. If Bryce Harper and Manny Machado can’t get them, who can?The new reality could be players seizing their money. Whenever they can.– – – – – –Mike Oz is a writer at Yahoo Sports.

Follow @MikeOzMore from Yahoo Sports:• Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlightSt. Louis Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright became the latest player to forecast a “doom and gloom” outlook for Major League Baseball based on the growing financial and philosophical disconnect between the players and the owners.The sentiment that a strike will happen is one we’ve become accustomed to hearing from the players. However, Wainwright framed the situation with a little more urgency on Friday by expressing concerns that a day of reckoning could happen sooner than later.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]Speaking to InsideSTL.com’s Tim McKernan, Wainwright said it was inevitable that the players will go on strike unless major changes are made to help bridge the widening gap. But he’s also worried that frustrations could reach a boiling point during the season leading to some form of a revolt. Perhaps even a mid-season walkout.#STLCards pitcher Adam Wainwright on @TMASTL: “Unless something changes, there’s going to be a strike. 100%. I’m just worried people are going to walk-out mid-season.” pic.twitter.com/M8WeRVcASe— Tim McKernan (@tmckernan) February 15, 2019“Unless something changes, there’s going to be a strike. 100%,” Wainwright said regarding the free-agent freeze that has left stars like Bryce Harper and Manny Machado without contracts. “I’m just worried people are going to walkout midseason.”It’s conceivable given the current climate, but a players revolt on that level still feels like a long shot. The target date we should all still be looking at is Dec. 1, 2021. That’s when the current collective bargaining agreement ends and the owners will be forced to come to the table.That doesn’t mean we should just dismiss Wainwright’s concerns about a 2019 strike. While they might feel a little on the dramatic side, the frustration that has built all offseason as dozens of free agents, including and especially Harper and Machado, remain unsigned is becoming more palpable by the day. There’s a genuine feeling that owners are determined to cut back on salaries even as profits continue to reach new heights, it’s possible the players’ patience will run out if the free-agent freeze continues to drag on. Wainwright thinks so, and he’s far from alone.In Friday’s interview, the 37-year-old right-hander also criticized owners and front offense personnel for placing too much emphasis on “analytics” and placing everything in a “sabermetric box” that discounts intangibles and other immeasurable aspects of baseball.Adam Wainwright said today on ⁦@TMASTL⁩ that he expects there to be a strike “100%.”The context of the conversation comes from a discussion on how Bryce Harper and Manny Machado are still without teams.You can see Wainwright’s reasoning in the video below. pic.twitter.com/GXsmx4cXk1— Tim McKernan (@tmckernan) February 15, 2019Wainwright admitted that there’s always risk in making long-term financial commitments to players, but emphasized that doing so marks a commitment to winning that several teams seemingly lack.“Part of it is smart from their side of it, but you have to realize it’s about winning. So, if Bryce Harper wants 10 years and he’s 26 years old. He’s going to be a dynamic player. The same can be said about Manny Machado. These guys are superstar players.”The deeper we get into it the more obvious it is that the players know what battles lie ahead. The only real question is how much worse it will get before any progress is made toward a satisfactory resolution.More from Yahoo Sports:• Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight MLB rumors: Bryce Harper has made his decision, says D.C. radio host originally appeared on nbcsportsbayarea.comA report has come out from the East Coast saying Bryce Harper has come to a decision on which team he will play for in 2019 and beyond.Chris Russell, a sports radio talk show host from 106.7 The Fan in Washington D.C., (who has been on the Harper beat for some time) said the free agent slugger could make a decision in the next 24 hours.\"Maybe I took a little bit of a leap of faith here based on some indications I got from a real good source,\" Russell told 94WIP, in Philadelphia, on Friday.\"Bryce and his representatives, (Scott) Boras, his people, his wife Kayla, they've been meeting since Monday morning in Vegas. Bryce originally wanted this done, when it took this long, by Valentine's Day. Obviously, the contract has not been announced, signed, or whatever.\"\"But I'm led to believe by the people that I've talked to that are close to the situation -- and I have, again, a real good source that has helped me through this process, let's just leave it at that,\" Russell said. \"That Bryce was in a mood to celebrate yesterday. Now, the source said, 'I believe it's done.' I don't have concrete, 100 percent proof for you guys. I wish I did, otherwise, I would have it and I would be running around with it. But I don't have that, so I want to caution everybody in Philadelphia. But that's what I was led to believe, that this thing is now decided.\"Russell then mentioned the Phillies.\"Now, what comes then is hammering out a contract. And if we were to believe the report that the Philadelphia Phillies had not even extended a formal offer -- and I assume that to be a termed, written agreement, that type of thing, which I find hard to believe -- then there might be more legwork to this. And therefore, hey the decision may be done, but the contract still needs to be ironed out.\"[RELATED: Phillies fan participates in \"lent\" in hopes of recruiting Harper]Russell is being safe with the terminology he's using, which is understandable. And while we haven't been able to confirm these rumors, Harper, along with many other free agents, remains unsigned.The Giants appeared to be the \"mystery team\" that introduced themselves late into the Harper sweepstakes -- and when the radio hosts asked Russell his opinion on where the outfielder will end up next season, he believed Harper will be in an orange and black uniform.\"I don't think it's going to be the Nationals,\" Russell said. \"I think it's going to be the San Francisco Giants, but that is not by any means an 'I know that for a fact,' so I want to caution everybody -- I know how this works -- I get in trouble with everything I say on my radio show, and everyone blows it up.\" The wait continues ... Golden State Warriors stars Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant empathised with Steve Kerr after the head coach was ejected during the loss to the Portland Trail Blazers having thrown a clipboard in response to a flagrant foul call.Kerr was enraged late in the fourth quarter when Draymond Green was called for a flagrant foul after he stopped Zach Collins from approaching the rim as he went up for a shot.That drew Kerr's ire and after ranting in one referee's face, he slammed a clipboard down to earn an ejection, with Durant having to escort his head coach back off the court.The Warriors lost the game 129-107 but will still head into the All-Star break with the best record in the Western Conference.\"It was an emotional game. We fought really hard for 43 minutes,\" Curry told reporters afterwards.\"One questionable decision - the flagrant - obviously the fire came out. You see coach go and throw a clipboard. At that point you try to get us over the hump. An eight-point swing, it's tough to overcome.\"\"I looked at the replay and the amount of ball [Green] got, there was nothing excessive about it, he got all the ball.\"There was a lot of chirping, with Zach involved. There was probably a sensitivity to it, trying to put out some fires, but I thought it was a terrible call. We obviously paid the price for it with how everything unfolded after that.\"Durant shared that sympathy having been the one to pull Kerr away from the referees as he continued to rant at them.\"I felt for him, I understand his anger and his rage, especially for that call,\" he said.\"I thought we should have just kept playing, It was a common foul, I thought. Refs looked at it differently. \"I understand why coach was a little frustrated.\"Kerr explained that it was the disbelief at the call that had triggered his reaction.\"I was just shocked that that was called a flagrant foul,\" he said. \"I'm not sure how it's determined - if it's in New York or the officials on the call - but that was head-scratching: that that could be called a flagrant foul.\"The guy's going to go in for a dunk, you've got to make sure he doesn't dunk it.\"So, I told Kenny [Mauer] that I beg to differ. There might have been a couple of other words in there too!\"I'll have to ask the owner if the clipboard broke when I threw it down. I got a little anger out so that was good. I was too busy yelling to ask for an explanation.\"Charles Barkley thinks New Orleans Pelicans star Anthony Davis made a mistake with his trade request.The 25-year-old asked the Pelicans to move him in late January and the Los Angeles Lakers had been engaged in discussions about acquiring him. But, no deal was reached before the deadline and Davis remained with New Orleans.Barkley, an 11-time All-Star who works as an analyst for TNT, said he thinks Davis and his agent, Rich Paul, mishandled the situation.\"Don't ruin your reputation as a great player, one of the nicest guys in the world,\" Barkley told reporters on Thursday ahead of All-Star weekend (via the Washington Post).\"Remember, your agent works for you, you don't work for him. They handled that situation wrong. It's going to come back to bite them in the a***. It's unfortunate.\"The six-time All-Star entered play on Thursday averaging 28.5 points and 13.1 rebounds this season. But, he scored just three points in 24 minutes on the floor in the Pelicans' 118-88 loss to the Orlando Magic earlier this week.\"This is a bad situation,\" Barkley said. \"It's a bad look for the NBA. Because that kid can't go out there and give 100 per cent because he’s worried about getting hurt. The guy's the second-best player in the world and he's got three points? That's not a good look for the NBA.\"The Boston Celtics and New York Knicks, among others, are expected to explore dealing for Davis after the season. Barkley, however, said he believes the forward will eventually land in Los Angeles because of Paul's relationship with Lakers star LeBron James.Barkley tallied 22.1 points and 11.7 rebounds per game over his 16-year career. He retired in 2000 and was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame six years later.After an apology from Sergio Garcia, a non-apology from Matt Kuchar, and an uncooperative Mother Nature on Valentine's Day, it's time for everyone to focus again on Tiger Woods. Kidding. Sort of. A weather-delayed first round at Riviera re-starts on Friday morning and the 14-time major champ will be in the Hollywood-area spotlight as he finally begins his Genesis Open. And golf fans could potentially see a LOT of the tournament host as the event tries to play catch up after heavy rains on Thursday.Woods, Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas (Decent group, eh?) are scheduled to tee off at 8:32 local time (11:32 ET). The hope is they will complete their first rounds and then play as much of their second rounds as possible before darkness. And Tiger's hope is to finally win for the first time at this historic layout where he missed the cut last year. We'll be tracking Tiger every step of the way so keep it right here for the latest scores, news and highlights. (All times eastern)SATURDAY, 11:25: With a 25-foot birdie putt on No. 9, Woods' final hole of the second round, Tiger will likely make the cut. The birdie brought Woods back to even on his round and to one under overall.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096808527694245890After resuming play in the morning, Woods bogeyed his first hole, No. 4, then made four pars before his finishing birdie. His playing partners, however, fared much better. Justin Thomas shares the lead with Adam Scott at 11 under and Rory McIlroy birdied four of his six holes on Saturday morning to shoot 63 and move to seven under through 36 holes. Thursday's early wave is now on the course for their second rounds.-------------------FRIDAY-------------------8:25: And with that, the horn has sounded—play will be suspended for darkness on Friday at Riviera. Tiger, JT and Rory have six more holes to complete their second round. Justin Thomas is at 10-under, tied with Adam Scott for the lead. Tiger will hope Saturday brings some different momentum for him—as this marathon day ends with two bogeys in a row after the highlight eagle.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10965708926692065298:21: That's back-to-back bogeys now for Tiger Woods, dropping another shot here at the third hole (his 12th of the round). And over his past six holes, Tiger has four bogeys. The birdie at No. 1 helped negate most of that damage ... but Tiger's back to 1-under again—right on the current cut line.8:13: On his 30th hole of the day, Tiger is showing some obvious signs of being tired. And who could blame him—he's been playing golf for nearly 10 hours straight. From 165 yards out at the third hole, Tiger Woods tries to chop out a 6-iron and comes out of it. His ball comes to rest short of the green. With sunset in Pacific Palisades being 5:30 local time, this group will have time for maybe one more hole today.8:04: Tiger follows up that eagle putt at No. 1 with a bogey at the second hole. The third bogey of his second round moves Tiger back to 2-under overall.7:56: After a long wait at the second hole, Tiger sprays his second shot from 235 out with a fairway wood out to the right. He'll have his work cut out from the front right bunker to save par at the 482-yard par 4.7:40: This is exactly what Tiger Woods needed: He rolls in his 43-foot eagle putt at his 10th hole (the first) to get back to 3-under—negating those two bogeys he made on his front nine. What a putt! With the flagstick in!https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096570892669206529Tiger made a disappointing par to open his first round earlier today at the first hole. The unlikely eagle makes up for that effort—and could turn around Tiger's second round in a dramatic way. Tiger goes from toeing the cut line at 1-under to now all of a sudden being T-21.7:28: Tiger finds the fairway at the par-5 first hole, the group's 10th hole of their second round, as he attempts to get a shot back here after bogeying two of his final three holes on his front nine. Neither bogey was particularly bad—the 18th hole is playing brutally tough right now uphill and into the wind with the rain, making it even more of a challenging hole. And his break at 16 was very unlucky.7:16: Tiger and JT are gonna have their work cut out to save par at the 18th hole (their ninth). Each player had fairway wood approaches and tried playing a big cut. JT was way up left on the hill—Tiger was closer. He went high with his approach and will have about 11 feet left for par.Tiger misses the par putt, so he'll drop a shot along with JT as they make the turn. Tiger moves back to 1-under after 27 holes. That's where the cut line currently is—so all of a sudden, Tiger must be concerned about making the cut.7:01: Following Justin Thomas throwing a dart at the 17th to about 3 feet, Tiger puts his wedge shot from under 100 yards to outside 20 feet, so he'll be disappointed with that effort. The birdie putt misses on the high side, and Tiger taps in for par to remain at 2-under. His playing partner and buddy Justin Thomas stays hot, rolling in a fourth straight birdie to get to 9-under—tied for the lead with Adam Scott. Really impressive golf here from JT.6:54: The rain is really coming down now as the players head to the 17th hole. Tiger finds the fairway at the par-5 17th hole, but it was a short one—he has 326 yards left. Most players have been laying up at this par 5 all day.6:43: From a brutal position up against the back lip of the bunker, Tiger hacks it out—and somehow keeps the ball on the green, albeit the back portion. His par attempt from 44 feet away here comes up three feet shy. Tiger makes his bogey to move back to 2-under.Meanwhile, Justin Thomas is officially on fire. He has another birdie after a fabulous tee shot at 16. It's now two Kentucky boys tied at the top: Justin Thomas and J.B. Holmes (-8).https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10965576791939317766:39: Tiger will have serious lie issues at the par-3 16th hole. His tee shot came to rest up against the back lip of the bunker. As Billy Kratzert just remarked on PGA Tour Live, Tiger will do well just to keep this ball on the green. Though he avoided dropping a shot on his last hole, there might be a bogey in his future here.6:35: A clutchhh par save by Tiger at the 15th hole makes up for his poor chip—and Tiger keeps the momentum going on his second round, as he stays 3-under for the tournament and 2-under on the round.Justin Thomas, also in Tiger's group, holed out from in front of the green for birdie at the 14th hole, and he makes a long birdie putt at 15 to get to 7-under—just one back of fellow Kentucky native J.B. Holmes.6:32: A poor chip shot from Tiger at the 15th hole leaves him about 13 feet away. He'll need to convert that putt to prevent dropping his first shot of his second round.6:24: Tiger finds another fairway here at Riviera, this one at the 15th hole. The guy is feeeling it with his driver. Almost on auto pilot. His approach from 190 out turns a little too much, finding the rough to the left of the green. He'll have to get up and down to avoid dropping one here.6:20: From 20 feet out, Tiger's birdie bid comes up shy—never really scaring the hole, despite getting a good look at the line from Rory's putt. Tiger taps in for par to remain at 3-under.The putter has been disappointing for Tiger all day: He had 34 putts in his first round, including four three-putts, just the third time in his career he's done that.6:13: Tiger puts his tee shot at the par-3 14th hole just inside Rory's ball—about 20 feet right of the hole. He'll get a little teach from Rory's putt, too, as Tiger continues to hit it well today.6:07: Tiger just misses the left-to-right curling bid for birdie, leaving himself with an easy par at 13. He stays 3-under for the tournament and -2 through four on his round.Tiger's playing partners are also playing well—Rory has three birdies in his first four holes to get to 2-under. Look out for Rory at rainy Riviera. And Justin Thomas, despite hitting his tee shot out of bounds at 13, got up and down from 160 yards to avoid dropping multiple shots. He's now 5-under after that bogey.6:02: Another grooved tee shot for Tiger Woods at the 13th hole puts him in good position. He turned over his tee shot—putting his draw in the middle of the fairway at the dogleg left. Tiger spins his approach back to about 15 feet, just off the green in the fringe. He'll have a chance to knock another one here and keep the momentum going.5:51: Bang! Tiger nails the 25-footer for birdie at the 12th hole to add a second birdie to his card through three holes. Realistically, too, it could be three straight birdies for Tiger. But the 14-time major champion is now 2-under through 3—T-3 for the tournament (T-19)—and carries some strong momentum on his side at the start of his second round ... as the rain is coming down at Riviera.5:46: Tiger hits his approach hole high—about 25 feet from 181 yards. He'll have another chance to add a birdie to his third round.Tiger's currently at 2-under, which puts him at T-29. The projected cut is at 1-under—so he's comfortably inside the number as of now. But there's a ton of golf to be played, obviously.5:41: Tiger finds the fairway with his driver at the par-4 12th hole. The 12th usually plays as one of the toughest holes at Riviera—we'll see if Tiger can take advantage of his position here in the fairway.5:33: An excellent fairway-wood second shot by Tiger put him right in front of the par-5 11th green in two. But a very poor approach putt for his third leaves him more than 10 feet away. His birdie try slides by for a very disappointing par being so close in 2. That should've been a golden opportunity to start his second round with two birdies—instead, Tiger stays at 2-under.5:12: Tiger goes high with his pitch—having to navigate around the front bunker, and plays it nicely—spinning it about 7 feet short of the hole. So Tiger will have a good look for an opening birdie to start his second round. Tiger converts the birdie putt to move to 2-under.5:02: Only a little more than a half hour after finishing his first round, Tiger Woods (-1) -- along with Justin Thomas (-5) and Rory McIlroy (+1) -- has teed off in his second round. The group started on the drivable 10th hole, and Tiger has driven his tee shot just off the green. He'll have a chance to put his pitch shot close to start his second round with a birdie.4:24: Tiger narrowly misses the birdie putt at the 18th hole, so he'll tap in for a par and an opening-round, one-under 70 at Riviera. Having three-putted for a fourth time on the 17th hole to drop a shot in disappointing fashion, Tiger will head to his second round a bit frustrated. But the four consecutive birdies showed him being able to score well at Riviera, where he has never won.Tiger, JT (who birdied 18 to finish at 5-under) and Rory will head right back for their second round in this marathon day for them.4:18: Tiger responds to that shocking three-putt with a perfect drive and a towering 6-iron on Riviera's famed 18th. Woods is in good shape to at least make par the difficult hole, but as we've seen all day, a two-putt is anything but automatic.Here's an unusual stat on Tiger three-putting four times this afternoon. He's making some history in a bad way...https://twitter.com/JustinRayGolf/status/10965196250582507574:06: So much for the momentum. . . After a decent approach shot that spins back to about 20 feet, Woods runs his birdie putt a couple feet by and. . . gulp. . . misses the comebacker from about two feet. Wow. That's four three-putts on the day as Tiger falls back to one under with one hole to play.3:57: Uh-oh, it's raining in southern California again. Meanwhile, Woods is plodding his way up the par-5 17th. After pulling his drive into the left rough and drawing a poor lie, Woods pushed his layup slightly into the first cut of the right rough. He'll have a some sort of wedge to a back-right hole location.3:50: Tiger's tee shot was tracking on the par-3 16th, but it comes up about 30 feet short. From there, he two-putts for par to remain at two under. Justin Thomas makes his 10-foot birdie effort to move to four under, while Rory McIlroy remains at one over. McIlroy hast two holes to avert his first over-par score of 2019.3:40: After another great drive and a solid approach, Woods races his birdie attempt nearly five feet past the hole. But he keeps the overall positive momentum going by converting the par putt to remain at two under. Tiger has three more holes to play. At least, before he gets a lunch break.3:24: BANG! There's the bounce back from Tiger. It just came one hole later. And from farther away as Woods drains his 12-footer for birdie on No. 14.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096507996031467520Woods is now back to two under, five shots behind Jordan Spieth, who has to be pleased to still be in front by two despite these soft conditions.3:17: Tiger hits a great shot on the difficult par-3 14th hole to about 15 feet. He'll have a good look at birdie coming up. In the meantime, here's a look at how the leader board stands with Jordan Spieth still leading the way.Jordan Spieth (-7) 2t. Tony Finau (-5) 2t. Patrick Rodgers (-5) 2t. Kramer Hickok (-5) 2t. Davis Love III (-5) 2t. Adam Scott (-5) 2t. J.B. Homes (-5)Click here for full scores.3:13: Woods stuck his approach to about four feet below the hole on No. 13. A bounce back birdie looked like a forgone conclusion until he pushed his effort. Woof. That's two three-putts and two short misses on the greens for Tiger today. He remains at one under. Meanwhile, Rory McIlroy, after getting to two under through eight, has fallen to one over after back-to-back bogeys. Justin Thomas, the third player in the group, continues to lead this trio at three under.3:05: After hitting fade after fade, Woods steps to the 13th tee and rips a draw around the corner, perfectly setting up his next shot. Good to see him working it both ways with ease.3:01: Tiger pushed his tee shot into the right rough, then hit a fantastic recovery shot from a thick lie onto the green. He had a long look at birdie that rolled about four feet past, leaving him with a tricky left-to-right par putt, which he missed. That's three three putts on the day for Woods, and he's still one under.2:39: Not the best chip from Woods, as he left himself about six feet for birdie, but he makes it anyway. Four straight for Tiger to get to two under for the day.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10964952191957975042:30: Woods rips a 3-wood from 269 to just in front of the green. Hate to jinx him, but there's no reason he shouldn't easily make his fourth straight birdie here (ducks).2:20: Three in a row for Woods as he rolls in another at No. 10 and moves to one under. If he finds the fairway again at the 11th, four in a row will be in his sights. Meanwhile, Rory makes his par to stay at one under and JT ends up holing his 10 footer for birdie to get to four under. Finally a little bit of JUICE from this threesome.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096489287753711616https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096489787672780800By the way, it looks like we know when they'll be heading back out for round two later today. Here's an update from the Tiger Tracker:https://twitter.com/GCTigerTracker/status/1096481806067523585That should give them enough time to get at least 11 or 12 holes in.At the 11th, Woods stripes another drive down the fairway. He's really starting to cook.2:12: Tiger's shot was a tad more difficult than we thought, as he had to avoid a bunker and take it up high to get it back to the pin. He was successful, sticking it to about three feet. Hell of a shot. Even better was Rory's shot, as he flopped it from a nice lie and got it to hang on just off the back of the green and stay out of the back bunker. Thomas, who had the easiest shot, put too much spin on his chip, leaving himself with about 10 feet for birdie.2:07: Finally, Tiger, Rory and JT hit their tee shots, and it looks like the ensuing entertainment will be well worth the wait. Tiger is in the collection area left of the green, where he has a straightforward chip that should set him up with a good chance to make birdie. Thomas is just in front of the green, and he'll have a great chance to make a birdie as well. Rory ... um ... not so much. He's in the rough with a greenside bunker in front of him and a pin he won't be able to get close to, and just holding the green would be a miracle.1:52: Woods drains his four-footer for bird and turns in even par 35. Real strong finish to his opening nine, and now it looks like he'll have a long wait at the 10th. DeChambeau, Kuchar and Rahm have still yet to hit their tee shots.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10964831254067896321:47: Tiger had just 122 left to the green and stuck one in there close. He has four feet left for birdie to turn in even par, which would be a small victory after that ugly three putt back at No. 7. Not to mention he'll have a prime opportunity to get into red figures at the driveable par-4 10th.1:41: Woods cranks another high fade right down the middle with the driver at No. 9. With the tees up today, he'll have a low iron in his hand for his approach.1:34: And he's on the board! Woods bounces back with a birdie putt from 15 feet, getting him back to one over. We'll see if that gets him going before making the turn.1:30: From 125 yards out, Woods hit a wedge and hated it from the second he made contact. While he did pull it, he's still hole high and inside 20 feet. Hideki Matsuyama-esque move from Tiger.1:24: Woods rips one right down the middle at the par-4 eighth. Should have a short iron in.1:15: Tiger's birdie putt was actually from just off the green on the fringe, and he rolled it by some four feet. Then, he missed the comebacker for par, dropping to two over on the day. Oof.1:09: Fairway and a green for Woods at the seventh. Good look at birdie coming up to get back to level par.12:58: Another hole, another par for Woods, who two-putted from 24 feet on the par-3 sixth. In the group up ahead, though, Jon Rahm is making a move at three under through six.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/109646557828021452912:47: Another meh hole for Tiger on No. 5, just missing the fairway with his tee shot, finding the front of the green with a so-so approach, and two-putting for another par from 43 feet. Woods remains at one over through five holes while his playing partners, McIlroy and Thomas, both remain at one under.12:42: As Matt Kuchar's ball is in the air on the par-3 sixth, a fan yells, \"Go low—just not with the gratuity!\" Despite Matt maintaining this is \"not a story,\" it is. And this won't be the last comment like this.12:29: Woods hit a nice shot to about 15 feet on the par-3 fourth, but ran his birdie effort by the hole. Still one over. Still no highlights. At least, from Tiger. Here was Spieth's closing birdie from about an hour ago, because there is not much else exciting going on right now.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/109644546143346688112:17: Another missed fairway and another short approach from Tiger on the par-4 third. Although, Woods found the putting surface, he was unable to two-putt from 63 feet, missing a seven-footer for par after badly misreading his first putt. That drops Tiger to one over through three holes. Not a lot of highlights so far. . .12:02: Tiger misses right off the tee on No. 2 then comes up short on another approach. But his pitch shot nearly goes down, leaving him with a tap-in par. Even par through two holes.11:49: After that perfect opening tee shot, Tiger hit a hideous approach with a 5-iron that came up way short in a fairway bunker. From there, he hit his third to 10 feet but missed the putt to walk away with a disappointing par. Both of Tiger's playing partners, McIlroy and Thomas, make birdie.11:38: Matt Kuchar just misses his eagle attempt from 25 feet on No. 1, but taps in for birdie. Kuchar has been in the news a lot this week over a caddie controversy dating back to his win at the Mayakoba Golf Classic. A controversy he didn't help with his comments on Wednesday. Is it possible some of those \"Kuuuuch\" shouts will turn to \"Mooooch\"? Kinda sounded like it on the first hole. . .11:34: Jordan Spieth is in with a seven-under-par 64 to take the early lead. Spieth needed only 21 putts during his bogey-free round. Of course, starting tournaments hasn't been a problem for Spieth of late. Finishing, however, has been a different story. Incredibly, Spieth is looking for his first win since the 2017 British Open and his first top 5 since last year's Masters.11:32: Woods smashes a driver off the first tee that finds the fairway. The opening par 5 at Riviera is essentially a long par 4 and one of the easiest holes on the PGA Tour all year so Tiger is thinking at least birdie after that tee shot.10:53: So far, so good on the Friday weather:https://twitter.com/GCTigerTracker/status/1096437235262533632And with lift, clean and place in play (for at least the first round), low scores are out there. Let's set the over/under on the Par-71 layout at 68.5.10:45: We are approximately 45 minutes away from Tiger's tee time and it's another major champ who is already off to a fantastic start. Jordan Spieth has the lead at six under through 15 holes. Spieth leads Patrick Rodgers by one and then there's a big group at four under, including Bill Haas, who is playing in the event a year after being involved in a car accident during last year's tournament that killed a friend he was staying with. Make sure you read Brian Wacker's piece from earlier in the week on how Haas is still trying to move on from that tragedy.10:35: As we move within an hour from Tiger teeing off, check out GOLFTV's latest behind-the-scenes video with Woods in which he says his bag has up to 16(!) golf gloves during rainy rounds and he explains why he doesn't like wearing rain jackets:https://twitter.com/GOLFTV/status/1096246456795697153\"Pops used to say, 'Once you're wet, you're wet.

Once he started running the front office, his blinking at Paul George on national TV contributed to the Lakers getting fined again for tampering.

But anybody else do it, they don’t get fined. So I’m going to stay away from that one.I don’t blame Johnson for feeling that way.Other teams’ owners, coaches and executives have repeatedly publicly discussed rival players without facing announced punishment.To be fair, the NBA doesn’t reveal every fine. Bucks owner Marc Lasry reportedly just got fined for tampering, but the league never announced it. But, at minimum, there’s an inconsistency with how the NBA exposes Johnson’s transgressions.Even NBA commissioner Adam Silver said last year there’s a spotlight on the Lakers due to prior tampering. That strikes me as unfair. The Lakers already paid for their prior violations and should now be held to the same standard as everyone else.And for what it’s worth, I wish that standard allowed an all-time great point guard like Johnson to publicly share his thoughts on Kemba Walker.Gareth Bale has landed himself in hot water after La Liga denounced the Real Madrid star for his celebration in the Madrid derby, which could carry a ban of four to 12 games.The Welsh forward scored as a substitute in the 3-1 victory over Atletico Madrid, bringing up his 100th goal for the club.And during the celebrations that followed, Bale \"lifted his right arm near his head in a clear sign of provocation towards the fans, then giving a gesture which could be seen as obscene and disdainful by folding his arm and striking it with his other hand.\"In a statement released by La Liga, Bale’s punishment will be decided by whether he incited the crowd or not.If Bale is guilty of “inciting opposition fans” to cause a hostile reaction, the punishment could carry four to 12 games, if there was no hostile reaction but intent, then it could be as little as one to three games.The gesture is referred to in Spain as ‘corte de mangas,’ with the moment not picked up in the referee’s match report.A committee will now decide whether the gesture merits a punishment.Bale also featured in Real’s Champions League victory over Ajax.Los Blancos take a 2-1 lead back to the Bernabeu for the second leg of the last 16 tie after Marco Asensio’s late winner.Earlier this week Heisman Trophy winner — and first round draft pick of the Oakland Athletics — Kyler Murray chose football over baseball, committing himself to the NFL draft. It was a move that, however sensible from Murray’s point of view, has led to a lot of soul-searching among baseball folks and has raised questions about what the sport offers young, talented athletes with other options.It’s not that bleak, however! Another outstanding college football player said no to football this week and reaffirmed his commitment to baseball. Tim Tebow! From PFT:One Florida Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback will not be coaching another in the Alliance of American Football.Steve Spurrier, the Florida Heisman winner who later coached the Gators to a national championship and is now head coach of the AAF’s Orlando Apollos, said this morning on PFT Live that after the AAF briefly reached out to Tebow in the ball, it became clear that Tebow’s focus is on playing baseball.Ok, so maybe Tebow is not turning down quite the football opportunity that Murray would’ve been. But take your victories where you can get them, baseball.Follow @craigcalcaterraPhil Mickelson is on an all-time heater in the early portion of the 2019 season. In the last month alone he's won his 44th PGA Tour event, finished second in another, hit every fairway in a round for the first time in 21 years, shot a 60, pulled off this impossible recovery shot, gone viral just by rolling his eyes and said he might drop the Players from his schedule because he's already won it (a literal mic drop). The man simply cannot be stopped right now.Leave it to the weather to literally rain on Lefty's parade. On Thursday at the Genesis Open, Mickelson began his first round at the difficult short par-4 10th and drove into one of the bunkers up near the green, leaving him with a dreaded lengthy sand shot. He wound up hitting it over the green, and his ball plugged in the back bunker, setting up an even harder shot than he just had. As you'll hear PGA Tour Live commentator Shane Bacon say, avoiding making a six was probably the goal, but after Mickelson hit his third into another bunker on the other side of the green, a six suddenly became best-case scenario. How does a four sound instead?https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096076528142626818Find us a more Phil Mickelson par ever... you can't. He's always got a flair for the dramatic. The problem? It's not going to count, as the tour wiped scores from the first 30 minutes of play due to the weather, thus making this the greatest par that never counted. It still counts in his mind though:https://twitter.com/PhilMickelson/status/1096106399958937605Peak Phil.RELATED: Where does Phil Mickelson rank among the greatest OMGs? (Old man golfers)\n"

      "        ©2019 Oath Inc. All Rights Reserved.    Yahoo Sports' Charles Robinson and Amanda Borges address the settlement between the players and the NFL, and what it means for their continuing efforts to promote social activism.The NBA jerseys of the future have a new feature to them: the ability to customize them after purchase by changing the name and number.In an awkward reveal reminiscent of a tech presentation, NBA commissioner Adam Silver and sportscaster Ahmad Rashad demonstrated the jersey at the NBA Tech Summit on Friday ahead of All-Star Weekend in Charlotte, switching a No. 30 Stephen Curry jersey to No. 23 Michael Jordan threads.Adam Silver just revealed the NBA jersey of the future that changes the name and number 🤯(via @NBA)pic.twitter.com/cgJk7KcIIU— Yahoo Sports (@YahooSports) February 15, 2019If Silver is trying to pull a Steve Jobs, perhaps he should stick to his day job. But in all seriousness, the jersey presents some interesting questions: Will it be easier for fans to “bandwagon”? Can players switch jerseys mid-game? Will Drake be first in line for this new prop?Meanwhile, Twitter had all of the jokes.Jersey cost only 20 easy installments of, $999.99.— Vod Kanockers (@JHoward2716) February 15, 2019Kevin Durant can now switch teams mid game with these new #NBA jerseys 😳 pic.twitter.com/a01rMkiexr— OT Sports Podcast Network (@OTSportsPod) February 15, 2019This could go one of two ways: Either the NBA will have found another way to separate itself from the other sports leagues or it will be a pointless feature that exists just because there is the technology to make it happen and for Twitter to crack jokes. In any case, you have to admit the NBA never fails to entertain.More from Yahoo Sports: • Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight When spring training camps opened this week around Major League Baseball, it brought hope that maybe, finally, Bryce Harper and Manny Machado would sign with teams and baseball’s long free-agent freeze would melt away.Nope. Not yet. Not only has that not happened, something else did happen: a number of talented young players around the league have agreed to team-friendly contract extensions.The latest was New York Yankees ace Luis Severino, who on Friday reportedly agreed to a four-year, $40 million deal. The deal, first reported by Joel Sherman of the New York Post, would buy up Severino’s arbitration years and comes with a $15 million club option for his first year of free agency.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]By agreeing to this deal, the Yankees and Severino avoid arbitration for 2019. He’ll make $4 million this season, $10 million next, then $10.25 million in 2021 and $11 million in 2022. The club option is for 2023. In the grand scheme of society, this is a very generous contract. In baseball’s economic bubble, it’s another young player signing for below-market value relative to his skills and potential.It’s hard to blame Severino for taking the deal, looking around at a free-agent world where Harper and Machado are still available, as are Dallas Keuchel and Craig Kimbrel. Especially since we haven’t heard even slight grumblings about teams being interested in Keuchel and Kimbrel.Coming off a breakout season in which he went 19-8 with a 3.39 ERA, the 25-year-old Severino was given a deal that’s pretty hard to turn down: “Do you want $40 million guaranteed, yes or no?”The other players faced with a similar question this week were Philadelphia Phillies ace Aaron Nola, who said yes to a four-year, $45 million deal Wednesday. It also avoided arbitration and bought out two of Nola’s free agency years, making it the most below-market deal of any of these.The Minnesota Twins locked up two of their talented young players Thursday, as right fielder Max Kepler agreed to a five-year, $35 million deal with a $10 million club option for 2024. It buys out three years of free agency for Kepler, 26. Shortstop Jorge Polanco also agreed to a five-year extension, his is worth $25.75 million with two option years that could keep him in Minnesota through 2025.In a vacuum, these types of extensions look like win-wins: The players get guaranteed money as they’re coming off good seasons. The clubs get cost-certainty to help them navigate the future — whether it’s the Yankees and Phillies trying to add big free agents this year or next, or a team like the Twins striving for contention with a homegrown core.In a bigger sense, though, it’s hard not to look at these deals in the current state of free agency and wonder if they’re a symptom of something else. Is it the market correcting itself? Is it baseball’s economy morphing into something new? Or maybe it’s just players looking around and saying, “Well, I better get my money now.”According to numerous reports, there’s a fear that for this generation of young players the light at the end of the tunnel — the big free-agency payday — won’t be there for them in the same way it was for so many other players.So while it’s great that stars like Justin Verlander, Clayton Kershaw and Max Scherzer are publicly speaking out about the current state of free agency, they’re on the right side of it. They got their mega deals.The younger players find themselves in a different sort of peril. It’s entirely possible that these are the biggest paydays these players ever get, which is a much different economic model that we’ve seen from baseball in the past.Whether it’s right or wrong — and that’s certainly something that’s up for debate heading into the next collective-bargaining agreement — baseball’s economy has often been backward. Players get paid less, relative to the market, in their pre-free agency years. The best recent example is Mike Trout winning the MVP in 2014 at age 22 while making $1 million.He got a raise to $6 million the next season, but in 2015 was still making a fraction of what people like Ryan Howard ($25M), Albert Pujols ($24M), Joe Mauer ($23M), Mark Teixeira ($22.5M) and Jose Reyes ($22M) were making.But that overpay is a necessary part baseball’s economic ecosystem too. It’s a fact: Players get overpaid as their careers decline. It’s almost like baseball’s way of making up for underpaying players during their early years. It’s baseball’s golden parachute. What’s happening these days is fewer teams are accepting that overpay as part of the how the system works.In the past few years, arbitration salaries have gotten higher and higher, and teams have tried harder to lock up younger stars before free agency. It’s why we’ve see players like Madison Bumgarner, Chris Archer, Chris Sale and Paul Goldschmidt become valuable trade chips for their team-friendly contract extensions.Teams are getting smarter about where their money goes, and how to keep value in their assets. These extensions to Severino, Nola and the rest show that they’re willing to spend money, just in the way that they want.Earlier this week, former Miami Marlins president David Samson tweeted something in response to Justin Verlander, saying the “broken system” talk was wrong. Players and their agents, Samson said, needed to adjust to a “new reality.”He may be right about the new reality part. The monster paydays at the end of the free agency tunnel could be fading away. If Bryce Harper and Manny Machado can’t get them, who can?The new reality could be players seizing their money. Whenever they can.– – – – – –Mike Oz is a writer at Yahoo Sports.

Follow @MikeOzMore from Yahoo Sports:• Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlightSt. Louis Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright became the latest player to forecast a “doom and gloom” outlook for Major League Baseball based on the growing financial and philosophical disconnect between the players and the owners.The sentiment that a strike will happen is one we’ve become accustomed to hearing from the players. However, Wainwright framed the situation with a little more urgency on Friday by expressing concerns that a day of reckoning could happen sooner than later.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]Speaking to InsideSTL.com’s Tim McKernan, Wainwright said it was inevitable that the players will go on strike unless major changes are made to help bridge the widening gap. But he’s also worried that frustrations could reach a boiling point during the season leading to some form of a revolt. Perhaps even a mid-season walkout.#STLCards pitcher Adam Wainwright on @TMASTL: “Unless something changes, there’s going to be a strike. 100%. I’m just worried people are going to walk-out mid-season.” pic.twitter.com/M8WeRVcASe— Tim McKernan (@tmckernan) February 15, 2019“Unless something changes, there’s going to be a strike. 100%,” Wainwright said regarding the free-agent freeze that has left stars like Bryce Harper and Manny Machado without contracts. “I’m just worried people are going to walkout midseason.”It’s conceivable given the current climate, but a players revolt on that level still feels like a long shot. The target date we should all still be looking at is Dec. 1, 2021. That’s when the current collective bargaining agreement ends and the owners will be forced to come to the table.That doesn’t mean we should just dismiss Wainwright’s concerns about a 2019 strike. While they might feel a little on the dramatic side, the frustration that has built all offseason as dozens of free agents, including and especially Harper and Machado, remain unsigned is becoming more palpable by the day. There’s a genuine feeling that owners are determined to cut back on salaries even as profits continue to reach new heights, it’s possible the players’ patience will run out if the free-agent freeze continues to drag on. Wainwright thinks so, and he’s far from alone.In Friday’s interview, the 37-year-old right-hander also criticized owners and front offense personnel for placing too much emphasis on “analytics” and placing everything in a “sabermetric box” that discounts intangibles and other immeasurable aspects of baseball.Adam Wainwright said today on ⁦@TMASTL⁩ that he expects there to be a strike “100%.”The context of the conversation comes from a discussion on how Bryce Harper and Manny Machado are still without teams.You can see Wainwright’s reasoning in the video below. pic.twitter.com/GXsmx4cXk1— Tim McKernan (@tmckernan) February 15, 2019Wainwright admitted that there’s always risk in making long-term financial commitments to players, but emphasized that doing so marks a commitment to winning that several teams seemingly lack.“Part of it is smart from their side of it, but you have to realize it’s about winning. So, if Bryce Harper wants 10 years and he’s 26 years old. He’s going to be a dynamic player. The same can be said about Manny Machado. These guys are superstar players.”The deeper we get into it the more obvious it is that the players know what battles lie ahead. The only real question is how much worse it will get before any progress is made toward a satisfactory resolution.More from Yahoo Sports:• Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight MLB rumors: Bryce Harper has made his decision, says D.C. radio host originally appeared on nbcsportsbayarea.comA report has come out from the East Coast saying Bryce Harper has come to a decision on which team he will play for in 2019 and beyond.Chris Russell, a sports radio talk show host from 106.7 The Fan in Washington D.C., (who has been on the Harper beat for some time) said the free agent slugger could make a decision in the next 24 hours.\"Maybe I took a little bit of a leap of faith here based on some indications I got from a real good source,\" Russell told 94WIP, in Philadelphia, on Friday.\"Bryce and his representatives, (Scott) Boras, his people, his wife Kayla, they've been meeting since Monday morning in Vegas. Bryce originally wanted this done, when it took this long, by Valentine's Day. Obviously, the contract has not been announced, signed, or whatever.\"\"But I'm led to believe by the people that I've talked to that are close to the situation -- and I have, again, a real good source that has helped me through this process, let's just leave it at that,\" Russell said. \"That Bryce was in a mood to celebrate yesterday. Now, the source said, 'I believe it's done.' I don't have concrete, 100 percent proof for you guys. I wish I did, otherwise, I would have it and I would be running around with it. But I don't have that, so I want to caution everybody in Philadelphia. But that's what I was led to believe, that this thing is now decided.\"Russell then mentioned the Phillies.\"Now, what comes then is hammering out a contract. And if we were to believe the report that the Philadelphia Phillies had not even extended a formal offer -- and I assume that to be a termed, written agreement, that type of thing, which I find hard to believe -- then there might be more legwork to this. And therefore, hey the decision may be done, but the contract still needs to be ironed out.\"[RELATED: Phillies fan participates in \"lent\" in hopes of recruiting Harper]Russell is being safe with the terminology he's using, which is understandable. And while we haven't been able to confirm these rumors, Harper, along with many other free agents, remains unsigned.The Giants appeared to be the \"mystery team\" that introduced themselves late into the Harper sweepstakes -- and when the radio hosts asked Russell his opinion on where the outfielder will end up next season, he believed Harper will be in an orange and black uniform.\"I don't think it's going to be the Nationals,\" Russell said. \"I think it's going to be the San Francisco Giants, but that is not by any means an 'I know that for a fact,' so I want to caution everybody -- I know how this works -- I get in trouble with everything I say on my radio show, and everyone blows it up.\" The wait continues ... Golden State Warriors stars Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant empathised with Steve Kerr after the head coach was ejected during the loss to the Portland Trail Blazers having thrown a clipboard in response to a flagrant foul call.Kerr was enraged late in the fourth quarter when Draymond Green was called for a flagrant foul after he stopped Zach Collins from approaching the rim as he went up for a shot.That drew Kerr's ire and after ranting in one referee's face, he slammed a clipboard down to earn an ejection, with Durant having to escort his head coach back off the court.The Warriors lost the game 129-107 but will still head into the All-Star break with the best record in the Western Conference.\"It was an emotional game. We fought really hard for 43 minutes,\" Curry told reporters afterwards.\"One questionable decision - the flagrant - obviously the fire came out. You see coach go and throw a clipboard. At that point you try to get us over the hump. An eight-point swing, it's tough to overcome.\"\"I looked at the replay and the amount of ball [Green] got, there was nothing excessive about it, he got all the ball.\"There was a lot of chirping, with Zach involved. There was probably a sensitivity to it, trying to put out some fires, but I thought it was a terrible call. We obviously paid the price for it with how everything unfolded after that.\"Durant shared that sympathy having been the one to pull Kerr away from the referees as he continued to rant at them.\"I felt for him, I understand his anger and his rage, especially for that call,\" he said.\"I thought we should have just kept playing, It was a common foul, I thought. Refs looked at it differently. \"I understand why coach was a little frustrated.\"Kerr explained that it was the disbelief at the call that had triggered his reaction.\"I was just shocked that that was called a flagrant foul,\" he said. \"I'm not sure how it's determined - if it's in New York or the officials on the call - but that was head-scratching: that that could be called a flagrant foul.\"The guy's going to go in for a dunk, you've got to make sure he doesn't dunk it.\"So, I told Kenny [Mauer] that I beg to differ. There might have been a couple of other words in there too!\"I'll have to ask the owner if the clipboard broke when I threw it down. I got a little anger out so that was good. I was too busy yelling to ask for an explanation.\"Charles Barkley thinks New Orleans Pelicans star Anthony Davis made a mistake with his trade request.The 25-year-old asked the Pelicans to move him in late January and the Los Angeles Lakers had been engaged in discussions about acquiring him. But, no deal was reached before the deadline and Davis remained with New Orleans.Barkley, an 11-time All-Star who works as an analyst for TNT, said he thinks Davis and his agent, Rich Paul, mishandled the situation.\"Don't ruin your reputation as a great player, one of the nicest guys in the world,\" Barkley told reporters on Thursday ahead of All-Star weekend (via the Washington Post).\"Remember, your agent works for you, you don't work for him. They handled that situation wrong. It's going to come back to bite them in the a***. It's unfortunate.\"The six-time All-Star entered play on Thursday averaging 28.5 points and 13.1 rebounds this season. But, he scored just three points in 24 minutes on the floor in the Pelicans' 118-88 loss to the Orlando Magic earlier this week.\"This is a bad situation,\" Barkley said. \"It's a bad look for the NBA. Because that kid can't go out there and give 100 per cent because he’s worried about getting hurt. The guy's the second-best player in the world and he's got three points? That's not a good look for the NBA.\"The Boston Celtics and New York Knicks, among others, are expected to explore dealing for Davis after the season. Barkley, however, said he believes the forward will eventually land in Los Angeles because of Paul's relationship with Lakers star LeBron James.Barkley tallied 22.1 points and 11.7 rebounds per game over his 16-year career. He retired in 2000 and was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame six years later.After an apology from Sergio Garcia, a non-apology from Matt Kuchar, and an uncooperative Mother Nature on Valentine's Day, it's time for everyone to focus again on Tiger Woods. Kidding. Sort of. A weather-delayed first round at Riviera re-starts on Friday morning and the 14-time major champ will be in the Hollywood-area spotlight as he finally begins his Genesis Open. And golf fans could potentially see a LOT of the tournament host as the event tries to play catch up after heavy rains on Thursday.Woods, Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas (Decent group, eh?) are scheduled to tee off at 8:32 local time (11:32 ET). The hope is they will complete their first rounds and then play as much of their second rounds as possible before darkness. And Tiger's hope is to finally win for the first time at this historic layout where he missed the cut last year. We'll be tracking Tiger every step of the way so keep it right here for the latest scores, news and highlights. (All times eastern)SATURDAY, 11:25: With a 25-foot birdie putt on No. 9, Woods' final hole of the second round, Tiger will likely make the cut. The birdie brought Woods back to even on his round and to one under overall.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096808527694245890After resuming play in the morning, Woods bogeyed his first hole, No. 4, then made four pars before his finishing birdie. His playing partners, however, fared much better. Justin Thomas shares the lead with Adam Scott at 11 under and Rory McIlroy birdied four of his six holes on Saturday morning to shoot 63 and move to seven under through 36 holes. Thursday's early wave is now on the course for their second rounds.-------------------FRIDAY-------------------8:25: And with that, the horn has sounded—play will be suspended for darkness on Friday at Riviera. Tiger, JT and Rory have six more holes to complete their second round. Justin Thomas is at 10-under, tied with Adam Scott for the lead. Tiger will hope Saturday brings some different momentum for him—as this marathon day ends with two bogeys in a row after the highlight eagle.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10965708926692065298:21: That's back-to-back bogeys now for Tiger Woods, dropping another shot here at the third hole (his 12th of the round). And over his past six holes, Tiger has four bogeys. The birdie at No. 1 helped negate most of that damage ... but Tiger's back to 1-under again—right on the current cut line.8:13: On his 30th hole of the day, Tiger is showing some obvious signs of being tired. And who could blame him—he's been playing golf for nearly 10 hours straight. From 165 yards out at the third hole, Tiger Woods tries to chop out a 6-iron and comes out of it. His ball comes to rest short of the green. With sunset in Pacific Palisades being 5:30 local time, this group will have time for maybe one more hole today.8:04: Tiger follows up that eagle putt at No. 1 with a bogey at the second hole. The third bogey of his second round moves Tiger back to 2-under overall.7:56: After a long wait at the second hole, Tiger sprays his second shot from 235 out with a fairway wood out to the right. He'll have his work cut out from the front right bunker to save par at the 482-yard par 4.7:40: This is exactly what Tiger Woods needed: He rolls in his 43-foot eagle putt at his 10th hole (the first) to get back to 3-under—negating those two bogeys he made on his front nine. What a putt! With the flagstick in!https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096570892669206529Tiger made a disappointing par to open his first round earlier today at the first hole. The unlikely eagle makes up for that effort—and could turn around Tiger's second round in a dramatic way. Tiger goes from toeing the cut line at 1-under to now all of a sudden being T-21.7:28: Tiger finds the fairway at the par-5 first hole, the group's 10th hole of their second round, as he attempts to get a shot back here after bogeying two of his final three holes on his front nine. Neither bogey was particularly bad—the 18th hole is playing brutally tough right now uphill and into the wind with the rain, making it even more of a challenging hole. And his break at 16 was very unlucky.7:16: Tiger and JT are gonna have their work cut out to save par at the 18th hole (their ninth). Each player had fairway wood approaches and tried playing a big cut. JT was way up left on the hill—Tiger was closer. He went high with his approach and will have about 11 feet left for par.Tiger misses the par putt, so he'll drop a shot along with JT as they make the turn. Tiger moves back to 1-under after 27 holes. That's where the cut line currently is—so all of a sudden, Tiger must be concerned about making the cut.7:01: Following Justin Thomas throwing a dart at the 17th to about 3 feet, Tiger puts his wedge shot from under 100 yards to outside 20 feet, so he'll be disappointed with that effort. The birdie putt misses on the high side, and Tiger taps in for par to remain at 2-under. His playing partner and buddy Justin Thomas stays hot, rolling in a fourth straight birdie to get to 9-under—tied for the lead with Adam Scott. Really impressive golf here from JT.6:54: The rain is really coming down now as the players head to the 17th hole. Tiger finds the fairway at the par-5 17th hole, but it was a short one—he has 326 yards left. Most players have been laying up at this par 5 all day.6:43: From a brutal position up against the back lip of the bunker, Tiger hacks it out—and somehow keeps the ball on the green, albeit the back portion. His par attempt from 44 feet away here comes up three feet shy. Tiger makes his bogey to move back to 2-under.Meanwhile, Justin Thomas is officially on fire. He has another birdie after a fabulous tee shot at 16. It's now two Kentucky boys tied at the top: Justin Thomas and J.B. Holmes (-8).https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10965576791939317766:39: Tiger will have serious lie issues at the par-3 16th hole. His tee shot came to rest up against the back lip of the bunker. As Billy Kratzert just remarked on PGA Tour Live, Tiger will do well just to keep this ball on the green. Though he avoided dropping a shot on his last hole, there might be a bogey in his future here.6:35: A clutchhh par save by Tiger at the 15th hole makes up for his poor chip—and Tiger keeps the momentum going on his second round, as he stays 3-under for the tournament and 2-under on the round.Justin Thomas, also in Tiger's group, holed out from in front of the green for birdie at the 14th hole, and he makes a long birdie putt at 15 to get to 7-under—just one back of fellow Kentucky native J.B. Holmes.6:32: A poor chip shot from Tiger at the 15th hole leaves him about 13 feet away. He'll need to convert that putt to prevent dropping his first shot of his second round.6:24: Tiger finds another fairway here at Riviera, this one at the 15th hole. The guy is feeeling it with his driver. Almost on auto pilot. His approach from 190 out turns a little too much, finding the rough to the left of the green. He'll have to get up and down to avoid dropping one here.6:20: From 20 feet out, Tiger's birdie bid comes up shy—never really scaring the hole, despite getting a good look at the line from Rory's putt. Tiger taps in for par to remain at 3-under.The putter has been disappointing for Tiger all day: He had 34 putts in his first round, including four three-putts, just the third time in his career he's done that.6:13: Tiger puts his tee shot at the par-3 14th hole just inside Rory's ball—about 20 feet right of the hole. He'll get a little teach from Rory's putt, too, as Tiger continues to hit it well today.6:07: Tiger just misses the left-to-right curling bid for birdie, leaving himself with an easy par at 13. He stays 3-under for the tournament and -2 through four on his round.Tiger's playing partners are also playing well—Rory has three birdies in his first four holes to get to 2-under. Look out for Rory at rainy Riviera. And Justin Thomas, despite hitting his tee shot out of bounds at 13, got up and down from 160 yards to avoid dropping multiple shots. He's now 5-under after that bogey.6:02: Another grooved tee shot for Tiger Woods at the 13th hole puts him in good position. He turned over his tee shot—putting his draw in the middle of the fairway at the dogleg left. Tiger spins his approach back to about 15 feet, just off the green in the fringe. He'll have a chance to knock another one here and keep the momentum going.5:51: Bang! Tiger nails the 25-footer for birdie at the 12th hole to add a second birdie to his card through three holes. Realistically, too, it could be three straight birdies for Tiger. But the 14-time major champion is now 2-under through 3—T-3 for the tournament (T-19)—and carries some strong momentum on his side at the start of his second round ... as the rain is coming down at Riviera.5:46: Tiger hits his approach hole high—about 25 feet from 181 yards. He'll have another chance to add a birdie to his third round.Tiger's currently at 2-under, which puts him at T-29. The projected cut is at 1-under—so he's comfortably inside the number as of now. But there's a ton of golf to be played, obviously.5:41: Tiger finds the fairway with his driver at the par-4 12th hole. The 12th usually plays as one of the toughest holes at Riviera—we'll see if Tiger can take advantage of his position here in the fairway.5:33: An excellent fairway-wood second shot by Tiger put him right in front of the par-5 11th green in two. But a very poor approach putt for his third leaves him more than 10 feet away. His birdie try slides by for a very disappointing par being so close in 2. That should've been a golden opportunity to start his second round with two birdies—instead, Tiger stays at 2-under.5:12: Tiger goes high with his pitch—having to navigate around the front bunker, and plays it nicely—spinning it about 7 feet short of the hole. So Tiger will have a good look for an opening birdie to start his second round. Tiger converts the birdie putt to move to 2-under.5:02: Only a little more than a half hour after finishing his first round, Tiger Woods (-1) -- along with Justin Thomas (-5) and Rory McIlroy (+1) -- has teed off in his second round. The group started on the drivable 10th hole, and Tiger has driven his tee shot just off the green. He'll have a chance to put his pitch shot close to start his second round with a birdie.4:24: Tiger narrowly misses the birdie putt at the 18th hole, so he'll tap in for a par and an opening-round, one-under 70 at Riviera. Having three-putted for a fourth time on the 17th hole to drop a shot in disappointing fashion, Tiger will head to his second round a bit frustrated. But the four consecutive birdies showed him being able to score well at Riviera, where he has never won.Tiger, JT (who birdied 18 to finish at 5-under) and Rory will head right back for their second round in this marathon day for them.4:18: Tiger responds to that shocking three-putt with a perfect drive and a towering 6-iron on Riviera's famed 18th. Woods is in good shape to at least make par the difficult hole, but as we've seen all day, a two-putt is anything but automatic.Here's an unusual stat on Tiger three-putting four times this afternoon. He's making some history in a bad way...https://twitter.com/JustinRayGolf/status/10965196250582507574:06: So much for the momentum. . . After a decent approach shot that spins back to about 20 feet, Woods runs his birdie putt a couple feet by and. . . gulp. . . misses the comebacker from about two feet. Wow. That's four three-putts on the day as Tiger falls back to one under with one hole to play.3:57: Uh-oh, it's raining in southern California again. Meanwhile, Woods is plodding his way up the par-5 17th. After pulling his drive into the left rough and drawing a poor lie, Woods pushed his layup slightly into the first cut of the right rough. He'll have a some sort of wedge to a back-right hole location.3:50: Tiger's tee shot was tracking on the par-3 16th, but it comes up about 30 feet short. From there, he two-putts for par to remain at two under. Justin Thomas makes his 10-foot birdie effort to move to four under, while Rory McIlroy remains at one over. McIlroy hast two holes to avert his first over-par score of 2019.3:40: After another great drive and a solid approach, Woods races his birdie attempt nearly five feet past the hole. But he keeps the overall positive momentum going by converting the par putt to remain at two under. Tiger has three more holes to play. At least, before he gets a lunch break.3:24: BANG! There's the bounce back from Tiger. It just came one hole later. And from farther away as Woods drains his 12-footer for birdie on No. 14.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096507996031467520Woods is now back to two under, five shots behind Jordan Spieth, who has to be pleased to still be in front by two despite these soft conditions.3:17: Tiger hits a great shot on the difficult par-3 14th hole to about 15 feet. He'll have a good look at birdie coming up. In the meantime, here's a look at how the leader board stands with Jordan Spieth still leading the way.Jordan Spieth (-7) 2t. Tony Finau (-5) 2t. Patrick Rodgers (-5) 2t. Kramer Hickok (-5) 2t. Davis Love III (-5) 2t. Adam Scott (-5) 2t. J.B. Homes (-5)Click here for full scores.3:13: Woods stuck his approach to about four feet below the hole on No. 13. A bounce back birdie looked like a forgone conclusion until he pushed his effort. Woof. That's two three-putts and two short misses on the greens for Tiger today. He remains at one under. Meanwhile, Rory McIlroy, after getting to two under through eight, has fallen to one over after back-to-back bogeys. Justin Thomas, the third player in the group, continues to lead this trio at three under.3:05: After hitting fade after fade, Woods steps to the 13th tee and rips a draw around the corner, perfectly setting up his next shot. Good to see him working it both ways with ease.3:01: Tiger pushed his tee shot into the right rough, then hit a fantastic recovery shot from a thick lie onto the green. He had a long look at birdie that rolled about four feet past, leaving him with a tricky left-to-right par putt, which he missed. That's three three putts on the day for Woods, and he's still one under.2:39: Not the best chip from Woods, as he left himself about six feet for birdie, but he makes it anyway. Four straight for Tiger to get to two under for the day.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10964952191957975042:30: Woods rips a 3-wood from 269 to just in front of the green. Hate to jinx him, but there's no reason he shouldn't easily make his fourth straight birdie here (ducks).2:20: Three in a row for Woods as he rolls in another at No. 10 and moves to one under. If he finds the fairway again at the 11th, four in a row will be in his sights. Meanwhile, Rory makes his par to stay at one under and JT ends up holing his 10 footer for birdie to get to four under. Finally a little bit of JUICE from this threesome.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096489287753711616https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096489787672780800By the way, it looks like we know when they'll be heading back out for round two later today. Here's an update from the Tiger Tracker:https://twitter.com/GCTigerTracker/status/1096481806067523585That should give them enough time to get at least 11 or 12 holes in.At the 11th, Woods stripes another drive down the fairway. He's really starting to cook.2:12: Tiger's shot was a tad more difficult than we thought, as he had to avoid a bunker and take it up high to get it back to the pin. He was successful, sticking it to about three feet. Hell of a shot. Even better was Rory's shot, as he flopped it from a nice lie and got it to hang on just off the back of the green and stay out of the back bunker. Thomas, who had the easiest shot, put too much spin on his chip, leaving himself with about 10 feet for birdie.2:07: Finally, Tiger, Rory and JT hit their tee shots, and it looks like the ensuing entertainment will be well worth the wait. Tiger is in the collection area left of the green, where he has a straightforward chip that should set him up with a good chance to make birdie. Thomas is just in front of the green, and he'll have a great chance to make a birdie as well. Rory ... um ... not so much. He's in the rough with a greenside bunker in front of him and a pin he won't be able to get close to, and just holding the green would be a miracle.1:52: Woods drains his four-footer for bird and turns in even par 35. Real strong finish to his opening nine, and now it looks like he'll have a long wait at the 10th. DeChambeau, Kuchar and Rahm have still yet to hit their tee shots.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10964831254067896321:47: Tiger had just 122 left to the green and stuck one in there close. He has four feet left for birdie to turn in even par, which would be a small victory after that ugly three putt back at No. 7. Not to mention he'll have a prime opportunity to get into red figures at the driveable par-4 10th.1:41: Woods cranks another high fade right down the middle with the driver at No. 9. With the tees up today, he'll have a low iron in his hand for his approach.1:34: And he's on the board! Woods bounces back with a birdie putt from 15 feet, getting him back to one over. We'll see if that gets him going before making the turn.1:30: From 125 yards out, Woods hit a wedge and hated it from the second he made contact. While he did pull it, he's still hole high and inside 20 feet. Hideki Matsuyama-esque move from Tiger.1:24: Woods rips one right down the middle at the par-4 eighth. Should have a short iron in.1:15: Tiger's birdie putt was actually from just off the green on the fringe, and he rolled it by some four feet. Then, he missed the comebacker for par, dropping to two over on the day. Oof.1:09: Fairway and a green for Woods at the seventh. Good look at birdie coming up to get back to level par.12:58: Another hole, another par for Woods, who two-putted from 24 feet on the par-3 sixth. In the group up ahead, though, Jon Rahm is making a move at three under through six.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/109646557828021452912:47: Another meh hole for Tiger on No. 5, just missing the fairway with his tee shot, finding the front of the green with a so-so approach, and two-putting for another par from 43 feet. Woods remains at one over through five holes while his playing partners, McIlroy and Thomas, both remain at one under.12:42: As Matt Kuchar's ball is in the air on the par-3 sixth, a fan yells, \"Go low—just not with the gratuity!\" Despite Matt maintaining this is \"not a story,\" it is. And this won't be the last comment like this.12:29: Woods hit a nice shot to about 15 feet on the par-3 fourth, but ran his birdie effort by the hole. Still one over. Still no highlights. At least, from Tiger. Here was Spieth's closing birdie from about an hour ago, because there is not much else exciting going on right now.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/109644546143346688112:17: Another missed fairway and another short approach from Tiger on the par-4 third. Although, Woods found the putting surface, he was unable to two-putt from 63 feet, missing a seven-footer for par after badly misreading his first putt. That drops Tiger to one over through three holes. Not a lot of highlights so far. . .12:02: Tiger misses right off the tee on No. 2 then comes up short on another approach. But his pitch shot nearly goes down, leaving him with a tap-in par. Even par through two holes.11:49: After that perfect opening tee shot, Tiger hit a hideous approach with a 5-iron that came up way short in a fairway bunker. From there, he hit his third to 10 feet but missed the putt to walk away with a disappointing par. Both of Tiger's playing partners, McIlroy and Thomas, make birdie.11:38: Matt Kuchar just misses his eagle attempt from 25 feet on No. 1, but taps in for birdie. Kuchar has been in the news a lot this week over a caddie controversy dating back to his win at the Mayakoba Golf Classic. A controversy he didn't help with his comments on Wednesday. Is it possible some of those \"Kuuuuch\" shouts will turn to \"Mooooch\"? Kinda sounded like it on the first hole. . .11:34: Jordan Spieth is in with a seven-under-par 64 to take the early lead. Spieth needed only 21 putts during his bogey-free round. Of course, starting tournaments hasn't been a problem for Spieth of late. Finishing, however, has been a different story. Incredibly, Spieth is looking for his first win since the 2017 British Open and his first top 5 since last year's Masters.11:32: Woods smashes a driver off the first tee that finds the fairway. The opening par 5 at Riviera is essentially a long par 4 and one of the easiest holes on the PGA Tour all year so Tiger is thinking at least birdie after that tee shot.10:53: So far, so good on the Friday weather:https://twitter.com/GCTigerTracker/status/1096437235262533632And with lift, clean and place in play (for at least the first round), low scores are out there. Let's set the over/under on the Par-71 layout at 68.5.10:45: We are approximately 45 minutes away from Tiger's tee time and it's another major champ who is already off to a fantastic start. Jordan Spieth has the lead at six under through 15 holes. Spieth leads Patrick Rodgers by one and then there's a big group at four under, including Bill Haas, who is playing in the event a year after being involved in a car accident during last year's tournament that killed a friend he was staying with. Make sure you read Brian Wacker's piece from earlier in the week on how Haas is still trying to move on from that tragedy.10:35: As we move within an hour from Tiger teeing off, check out GOLFTV's latest behind-the-scenes video with Woods in which he says his bag has up to 16(!) golf gloves during rainy rounds and he explains why he doesn't like wearing rain jackets:https://twitter.com/GOLFTV/status/1096246456795697153\"Pops used to say, 'Once you're wet, you're wet.

Once he started running the front office, his blinking at Paul George on national TV contributed to the Lakers getting fined again for tampering. Johnson’s praise of Giannis Antetokounmpo drew yet another tampering fine.So, though he escaped punishment for his recent comments on 76ers guard Ben Simmons, Johnson refused to answer a question about Hornets guard Kemba Walker.Carolina Blitz:Asked Magic about Kemba and he said y’all aren’t going to catch him slipping anymore. pic.twitter.com/sQZtIWnQbn— Carolina Blitz (@KeepBlitzin) February 15, 2019Johnson:You know I can’t answer any questions about no players, because every time I do it, I get fined. But anybody else do it, they don’t get fined. So I’m going to stay away from that one.I don’t blame Johnson for feeling that way.Other teams’ owners, coaches and executives have repeatedly publicly discussed rival players without facing announced punishment.To be fair, the NBA doesn’t reveal every fine. Bucks owner Marc Lasry reportedly just got fined for tampering, but the league never announced it. But, at minimum, there’s an inconsistency with how the NBA exposes Johnson’s transgressions.Even NBA commissioner Adam Silver said last year there’s a spotlight on the Lakers due to prior tampering. That strikes me as unfair. The Lakers already paid for their prior violations and should now be held to the same standard as everyone else.And for what it’s worth, I wish that standard allowed an all-time great point guard like Johnson to publicly share his thoughts on Kemba Walker.Gareth Bale has landed himself in hot water after La Liga denounced the Real Madrid star for his celebration in the Madrid derby, which could carry a ban of four to 12 games.The Welsh forward scored as a substitute in the 3-1 victory over Atletico Madrid, bringing up his 100th goal for the club.And during the celebrations that followed, Bale \"lifted his right arm near his head in a clear sign of provocation towards the fans, then giving a gesture which could be seen as obscene and disdainful by folding his arm and striking it with his other hand.\"In a statement released by La Liga, Bale’s punishment will be decided by whether he incited the crowd or not.If Bale is guilty of “inciting opposition fans” to cause a hostile reaction, the punishment could carry four to 12 games, if there was no hostile reaction but intent, then it could be as little as one to three games.The gesture is referred to in Spain as ‘corte de mangas,’ with the moment not picked up in the referee’s match report.A committee will now decide whether the gesture merits a punishment.Bale also featured in Real’s Champions League victory over Ajax.Los Blancos take a 2-1 lead back to the Bernabeu for the second leg of the last 16 tie after Marco Asensio’s late winner.Earlier this week Heisman Trophy winner — and first round draft pick of the Oakland Athletics — Kyler Murray chose football over baseball, committing himself to the NFL draft. It was a move that, however sensible from Murray’s point of view, has led to a lot of soul-searching among baseball folks and has raised questions about what the sport offers young, talented athletes with other options.It’s not that bleak, however! Another outstanding college football player said no to football this week and reaffirmed his commitment to baseball. Tim Tebow! From PFT:One Florida Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback will not be coaching another in the Alliance of American Football.Steve Spurrier, the Florida Heisman winner who later coached the Gators to a national championship and is now head coach of the AAF’s Orlando Apollos, said this morning on PFT Live that after the AAF briefly reached out to Tebow in the ball, it became clear that Tebow’s focus is on playing baseball.Ok, so maybe Tebow is not turning down quite the football opportunity that Murray would’ve been. But take your victories where you can get them, baseball.Follow @craigcalcaterraPhil Mickelson is on an all-time heater in the early portion of the 2019 season. In the last month alone he's won his 44th PGA Tour event, finished second in another, hit every fairway in a round for the first time in 21 years, shot a 60, pulled off this impossible recovery shot, gone viral just by rolling his eyes and said he might drop the Players from his schedule because he's already won it (a literal mic drop). The man simply cannot be stopped right now.Leave it to the weather to literally rain on Lefty's parade. On Thursday at the Genesis Open, Mickelson began his first round at the difficult short par-4 10th and drove into one of the bunkers up near the green, leaving him with a dreaded lengthy sand shot. He wound up hitting it over the green, and his ball plugged in the back bunker, setting up an even harder shot than he just had. As you'll hear PGA Tour Live commentator Shane Bacon say, avoiding making a six was probably the goal, but after Mickelson hit his third into another bunker on the other side of the green, a six suddenly became best-case scenario. How does a four sound instead?https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096076528142626818Find us a more Phil Mickelson par ever... you can't. He's always got a flair for the dramatic. The problem? It's not going to count, as the tour wiped scores from the first 30 minutes of play due to the weather, thus making this the greatest par that never counted. It still counts in his mind though:https://twitter.com/PhilMickelson/status/1096106399958937605Peak Phil.RELATED: Where does Phil Mickelson rank among the greatest OMGs? (Old man golfers)The dust is barely settled in the wake of the end of the Markelle Fultz era in Philadelphia, and the former 76ers guard is already taking shots at his old team.His old coach Brett Brown in particular.Fultz had his introductory press conference with the Orlando Magic on Thursday after being traded at last week’s deadline and praised his new coach Steve Clifford while taking a veiled shot at Brown.“It just excites me to know that I have a coach that’s going to push you to be better and not just going to tell you what you want to hear,” Fultz said.That’s direct praise for his new coach. But the message for Brown is clear. Fultz didn’t like what he heard from the Philadelphia coaching staff.Fultz never had any public dispute with the 76ers, but it was evident that he and the team had different approaches to the struggles that saw him shoot 41.4 percent from the field, 26.7 percent from 3-point distance and 53.4 percent from the line in limited action after being selected as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2017 draft.It’s still not clear whether injury or a mental block – or both – are the cause of his shooting issues.After his agent announced that the nerve disorder thoracic outlet syndrome was the root of the shooting woes, Fultz never played again for the 76ers.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]Fultz appears to be fully embracing the fresh start in Orlando as a player and a person.“I think the biggest thing we talked about what doing thing the right way,” Fultz said. “Just building me up both as a man and on the court. I think that’s music to my ears, really just. Two things I really want to do is be the best player I can be and be the best young man I can be.”Fultz described the experience of his nerve disorder to reporters.“It’s hard to lift up your arms, you lose feeling in your fingers,” Fultz said. “You can’t tell when it’s going to happen. It’s not like you do the same motion every time. You get tingling in your fingers, numbness. Stuff like that.”He also curtly dismissed any notion that his shooting struggles are due to anything but injury.“I had an injury,” Fultz said. “I was out there trying to play through that. I never lost confidence.”Asked about a timetable to return, Fultz dodged the question to talk about rehab.“Right now it’s just about getting everything the right way,” he said. “Rehab’s been going great. I’m just taking my time and doing everything the right way.”More from Yahoo Sports: • PGA Tour pro defends paying caddie $5K on $1.3M win • NFL bars NCAA’s all-time sack leader from combine • Only one NBA team failed to scout Antetokounmpo • Black History honor for Kaepernick sacked by lawmakers \n"

Yahoo Sports' Charles Robinson and Amanda Borges address the settlement between the players and the NFL, and what it means for their continuing efforts to promote social activism.The NBA jerseys of the future have a new feature to them: the ability to customize them after purchase by changing the name and number.In an awkward reveal reminiscent of a tech presentation, NBA commissioner Adam Silver and sportscaster Ahmad Rashad demonstrated the jersey at the NBA Tech Summit on Friday ahead of All-Star Weekend in Charlotte, switching a No. 30 Stephen Curry jersey to No. 23 Michael Jordan threads.Adam Silver just revealed the NBA jersey of the future that changes the name and number 🤯(via @NBA)pic.twitter.com/cgJk7KcIIU— Yahoo Sports (@YahooSports) February 15, 2019If Silver is trying to pull a Steve Jobs, perhaps he should stick to his day job. But in all seriousness, the jersey presents some interesting questions: Will it be easier for fans to “bandwagon”? Can players switch jerseys mid-game? Will Drake be first in line for this new prop?Meanwhile, Twitter had all of the jokes.Jersey cost only 20 easy installments of, $999.99.— Vod Kanockers (@JHoward2716) February 15, 2019Kevin Durant can now switch teams mid game with these new #NBA jerseys 😳 pic.twitter.com/a01rMkiexr— OT Sports Podcast Network (@OTSportsPod) February 15, 2019This could go one of two ways: Either the NBA will have found another way to separate itself from the other sports leagues or it will be a pointless feature that exists just because there is the technology to make it happen and for Twitter to crack jokes. In any case, you have to admit the NBA never fails to entertain.More from Yahoo Sports: • Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight When spring training camps opened this week around Major League Baseball, it brought hope that maybe, finally, Bryce Harper and Manny Machado would sign with teams and baseball’s long free-agent freeze would melt away.Nope. Not yet. Not only has that not happened, something else did happen: a number of talented young players around the league have agreed to team-friendly contract extensions.The latest was New York Yankees ace Luis Severino, who on Friday reportedly agreed to a four-year, $40 million deal. The deal, first reported by Joel Sherman of the New York Post, would buy up Severino’s arbitration years and comes with a $15 million club option for his first year of free agency.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]By agreeing to this deal, the Yankees and Severino avoid arbitration for 2019. He’ll make $4 million this season, $10 million next, then $10.25 million in 2021 and $11 million in 2022. The club option is for 2023. In the grand scheme of society, this is a very generous contract. In baseball’s economic bubble, it’s another young player signing for below-market value relative to his skills and potential.It’s hard to blame Severino for taking the deal, looking around at a free-agent world where Harper and Machado are still available, as are Dallas Keuchel and Craig Kimbrel. Especially since we haven’t heard even slight grumblings about teams being interested in Keuchel and Kimbrel.Coming off a breakout season in which he went 19-8 with a 3.39 ERA, the 25-year-old Severino was given a deal that’s pretty hard to turn down: “Do you want $40 million guaranteed, yes or no?”The other players faced with a similar question this week were Philadelphia Phillies ace Aaron Nola, who said yes to a four-year, $45 million deal Wednesday. It also avoided arbitration and bought out two of Nola’s free agency years, making it the most below-market deal of any of these.The Minnesota Twins locked up two of their talented young players Thursday, as right fielder Max Kepler agreed to a five-year, $35 million deal with a $10 million club option for 2024. It buys out three years of free agency for Kepler, 26. Shortstop Jorge Polanco also agreed to a five-year extension, his is worth $25.75 million with two option years that could keep him in Minnesota through 2025.In a vacuum, these types of extensions look like win-wins: The players get guaranteed money as they’re coming off good seasons. The clubs get cost-certainty to help them navigate the future — whether it’s the Yankees and Phillies trying to add big free agents this year or next, or a team like the Twins striving for contention with a homegrown core.In a bigger sense, though, it’s hard not to look at these deals in the current state of free agency and wonder if they’re a symptom of something else. Is it the market correcting itself? Is it baseball’s economy morphing into something new? Or maybe it’s just players looking around and saying, “Well, I better get my money now.”According to numerous reports, there’s a fear that for this generation of young players the light at the end of the tunnel — the big free-agency payday — won’t be there for them in the same way it was for so many other players.So while it’s great that stars like Justin Verlander, Clayton Kershaw and Max Scherzer are publicly speaking out about the current state of free agency, they’re on the right side of it. They got their mega deals.The younger players find themselves in a different sort of peril. It’s entirely possible that these are the biggest paydays these players ever get, which is a much different economic model that we’ve seen from baseball in the past.Whether it’s right or wrong — and that’s certainly something that’s up for debate heading into the next collective-bargaining agreement — baseball’s economy has often been backward. Players get paid less, relative to the market, in their pre-free agency years. The best recent example is Mike Trout winning the MVP in 2014 at age 22 while making $1 million.He got a raise to $6 million the next season, but in 2015 was still making a fraction of what people like Ryan Howard ($25M), Albert Pujols ($24M), Joe Mauer ($23M), Mark Teixeira ($22.5M) and Jose Reyes ($22M) were making.But that overpay is a necessary part baseball’s economic ecosystem too. It’s a fact: Players get overpaid as their careers decline. It’s almost like baseball’s way of making up for underpaying players during their early years. It’s baseball’s golden parachute. What’s happening these days is fewer teams are accepting that overpay as part of the how the system works.In the past few years, arbitration salaries have gotten higher and higher, and teams have tried harder to lock up younger stars before free agency. It’s why we’ve see players like Madison Bumgarner, Chris Archer, Chris Sale and Paul Goldschmidt become valuable trade chips for their team-friendly contract extensions.Teams are getting smarter about where their money goes, and how to keep value in their assets. These extensions to Severino, Nola and the rest show that they’re willing to spend money, just in the way that they want.Earlier this week, former Miami Marlins president David Samson tweeted something in response to Justin Verlander, saying the “broken system” talk was wrong. Players and their agents, Samson said, needed to adjust to a “new reality.”He may be right about the new reality part. The monster paydays at the end of the free agency tunnel could be fading away. If Bryce Harper and Manny Machado can’t get them, who can?The new reality could be players seizing their money. Whenever they can.– – – – – –Mike Oz is a writer at Yahoo Sports.

Follow @MikeOzMore from Yahoo Sports:• Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlightSt. Louis Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright became the latest player to forecast a “doom and gloom” outlook for Major League Baseball based on the growing financial and philosophical disconnect between the players and the owners.The sentiment that a strike will happen is one we’ve become accustomed to hearing from the players. However, Wainwright framed the situation with a little more urgency on Friday by expressing concerns that a day of reckoning could happen sooner than later.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]Speaking to InsideSTL.com’s Tim McKernan, Wainwright said it was inevitable that the players will go on strike unless major changes are made to help bridge the widening gap. But he’s also worried that frustrations could reach a boiling point during the season leading to some form of a revolt. Perhaps even a mid-season walkout.#STLCards pitcher Adam Wainwright on @TMASTL: “Unless something changes, there’s going to be a strike. 100%. I’m just worried people are going to walk-out mid-season.” pic.twitter.com/M8WeRVcASe— Tim McKernan (@tmckernan) February 15, 2019“Unless something changes, there’s going to be a strike. 100%,” Wainwright said regarding the free-agent freeze that has left stars like Bryce Harper and Manny Machado without contracts. “I’m just worried people are going to walkout midseason.”It’s conceivable given the current climate, but a players revolt on that level still feels like a long shot. The target date we should all still be looking at is Dec. 1, 2021. That’s when the current collective bargaining agreement ends and the owners will be forced to come to the table.That doesn’t mean we should just dismiss Wainwright’s concerns about a 2019 strike. While they might feel a little on the dramatic side, the frustration that has built all offseason as dozens of free agents, including and especially Harper and Machado, remain unsigned is becoming more palpable by the day. There’s a genuine feeling that owners are determined to cut back on salaries even as profits continue to reach new heights, it’s possible the players’ patience will run out if the free-agent freeze continues to drag on. Wainwright thinks so, and he’s far from alone.In Friday’s interview, the 37-year-old right-hander also criticized owners and front offense personnel for placing too much emphasis on “analytics” and placing everything in a “sabermetric box” that discounts intangibles and other immeasurable aspects of baseball.Adam Wainwright said today on ⁦@TMASTL⁩ that he expects there to be a strike “100%.”The context of the conversation comes from a discussion on how Bryce Harper and Manny Machado are still without teams.You can see Wainwright’s reasoning in the video below. pic.twitter.com/GXsmx4cXk1— Tim McKernan (@tmckernan) February 15, 2019Wainwright admitted that there’s always risk in making long-term financial commitments to players, but emphasized that doing so marks a commitment to winning that several teams seemingly lack.“Part of it is smart from their side of it, but you have to realize it’s about winning. So, if Bryce Harper wants 10 years and he’s 26 years old. He’s going to be a dynamic player. The same can be said about Manny Machado. These guys are superstar players.”The deeper we get into it the more obvious it is that the players know what battles lie ahead. The only real question is how much worse it will get before any progress is made toward a satisfactory resolution.More from Yahoo Sports:• Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight MLB rumors: Bryce Harper has made his decision, says D.C. radio host originally appeared on nbcsportsbayarea.comA report has come out from the East Coast saying Bryce Harper has come to a decision on which team he will play for in 2019 and beyond.Chris Russell, a sports radio talk show host from 106.7 The Fan in Washington D.C., (who has been on the Harper beat for some time) said the free agent slugger could make a decision in the next 24 hours.\"Maybe I took a little bit of a leap of faith here based on some indications I got from a real good source,\" Russell told 94WIP, in Philadelphia, on Friday.\"Bryce and his representatives, (Scott) Boras, his people, his wife Kayla, they've been meeting since Monday morning in Vegas. Bryce originally wanted this done, when it took this long, by Valentine's Day. Obviously, the contract has not been announced, signed, or whatever.\"\"But I'm led to believe by the people that I've talked to that are close to the situation -- and I have, again, a real good source that has helped me through this process, let's just leave it at that,\" Russell said. \"That Bryce was in a mood to celebrate yesterday. Now, the source said, 'I believe it's done.' I don't have concrete, 100 percent proof for you guys. I wish I did, otherwise, I would have it and I would be running around with it. But I don't have that, so I want to caution everybody in Philadelphia. But that's what I was led to believe, that this thing is now decided.\"Russell then mentioned the Phillies.\"Now, what comes then is hammering out a contract. And if we were to believe the report that the Philadelphia Phillies had not even extended a formal offer -- and I assume that to be a termed, written agreement, that type of thing, which I find hard to believe -- then there might be more legwork to this. And therefore, hey the decision may be done, but the contract still needs to be ironed out.\"[RELATED: Phillies fan participates in \"lent\" in hopes of recruiting Harper]Russell is being safe with the terminology he's using, which is understandable. And while we haven't been able to confirm these rumors, Harper, along with many other free agents, remains unsigned.The Giants appeared to be the \"mystery team\" that introduced themselves late into the Harper sweepstakes -- and when the radio hosts asked Russell his opinion on where the outfielder will end up next season, he believed Harper will be in an orange and black uniform.\"I don't think it's going to be the Nationals,\" Russell said. \"I think it's going to be the San Francisco Giants, but that is not by any means an 'I know that for a fact,' so I want to caution everybody -- I know how this works -- I get in trouble with everything I say on my radio show, and everyone blows it up.\" The wait continues ... Golden State Warriors stars Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant empathised with Steve Kerr after the head coach was ejected during the loss to the Portland Trail Blazers having thrown a clipboard in response to a flagrant foul call.Kerr was enraged late in the fourth quarter when Draymond Green was called for a flagrant foul after he stopped Zach Collins from approaching the rim as he went up for a shot.That drew Kerr's ire and after ranting in one referee's face, he slammed a clipboard down to earn an ejection, with Durant having to escort his head coach back off the court.The Warriors lost the game 129-107 but will still head into the All-Star break with the best record in the Western Conference.\"It was an emotional game. We fought really hard for 43 minutes,\" Curry told reporters afterwards.\"One questionable decision - the flagrant - obviously the fire came out. You see coach go and throw a clipboard. At that point you try to get us over the hump. An eight-point swing, it's tough to overcome.\"\"I looked at the replay and the amount of ball [Green] got, there was nothing excessive about it, he got all the ball.\"There was a lot of chirping, with Zach involved. There was probably a sensitivity to it, trying to put out some fires, but I thought it was a terrible call. We obviously paid the price for it with how everything unfolded after that.\"Durant shared that sympathy having been the one to pull Kerr away from the referees as he continued to rant at them.\"I felt for him, I understand his anger and his rage, especially for that call,\" he said.\"I thought we should have just kept playing, It was a common foul, I thought. Refs looked at it differently. \"I understand why coach was a little frustrated.\"Kerr explained that it was the disbelief at the call that had triggered his reaction.\"I was just shocked that that was called a flagrant foul,\" he said. \"I'm not sure how it's determined - if it's in New York or the officials on the call - but that was head-scratching: that that could be called a flagrant foul.\"The guy's going to go in for a dunk, you've got to make sure he doesn't dunk it.\"So, I told Kenny [Mauer] that I beg to differ. There might have been a couple of other words in there too!\"I'll have to ask the owner if the clipboard broke when I threw it down. I got a little anger out so that was good. I was too busy yelling to ask for an explanation.\"Charles Barkley thinks New Orleans Pelicans star Anthony Davis made a mistake with his trade request.The 25-year-old asked the Pelicans to move him in late January and the Los Angeles Lakers had been engaged in discussions about acquiring him. But, no deal was reached before the deadline and Davis remained with New Orleans.Barkley, an 11-time All-Star who works as an analyst for TNT, said he thinks Davis and his agent, Rich Paul, mishandled the situation.\"Don't ruin your reputation as a great player, one of the nicest guys in the world,\" Barkley told reporters on Thursday ahead of All-Star weekend (via the Washington Post).\"Remember, your agent works for you, you don't work for him. They handled that situation wrong. It's going to come back to bite them in the a***. It's unfortunate.\"The six-time All-Star entered play on Thursday averaging 28.5 points and 13.1 rebounds this season. But, he scored just three points in 24 minutes on the floor in the Pelicans' 118-88 loss to the Orlando Magic earlier this week.\"This is a bad situation,\" Barkley said. \"It's a bad look for the NBA. Because that kid can't go out there and give 100 per cent because he’s worried about getting hurt. The guy's the second-best player in the world and he's got three points? That's not a good look for the NBA.\"The Boston Celtics and New York Knicks, among others, are expected to explore dealing for Davis after the season. Barkley, however, said he believes the forward will eventually land in Los Angeles because of Paul's relationship with Lakers star LeBron James.Barkley tallied 22.1 points and 11.7 rebounds per game over his 16-year career. He retired in 2000 and was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame six years later.After an apology from Sergio Garcia, a non-apology from Matt Kuchar, and an uncooperative Mother Nature on Valentine's Day, it's time for everyone to focus again on Tiger Woods. Kidding. Sort of. A weather-delayed first round at Riviera re-starts on Friday morning and the 14-time major champ will be in the Hollywood-area spotlight as he finally begins his Genesis Open. And golf fans could potentially see a LOT of the tournament host as the event tries to play catch up after heavy rains on Thursday.Woods, Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas (Decent group, eh?) are scheduled to tee off at 8:32 local time (11:32 ET). The hope is they will complete their first rounds and then play as much of their second rounds as possible before darkness. And Tiger's hope is to finally win for the first time at this historic layout where he missed the cut last year. We'll be tracking Tiger every step of the way so keep it right here for the latest scores, news and highlights. (All times eastern)SATURDAY, 11:25: With a 25-foot birdie putt on No. 9, Woods' final hole of the second round, Tiger will likely make the cut. The birdie brought Woods back to even on his round and to one under overall.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096808527694245890After resuming play in the morning, Woods bogeyed his first hole, No. 4, then made four pars before his finishing birdie. His playing partners, however, fared much better. Justin Thomas shares the lead with Adam Scott at 11 under and Rory McIlroy birdied four of his six holes on Saturday morning to shoot 63 and move to seven under through 36 holes. Thursday's early wave is now on the course for their second rounds.-------------------FRIDAY-------------------8:25: And with that, the horn has sounded—play will be suspended for darkness on Friday at Riviera. Tiger, JT and Rory have six more holes to complete their second round. Justin Thomas is at 10-under, tied with Adam Scott for the lead. Tiger will hope Saturday brings some different momentum for him—as this marathon day ends with two bogeys in a row after the highlight eagle.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10965708926692065298:21: That's back-to-back bogeys now for Tiger Woods, dropping another shot here at the third hole (his 12th of the round). And over his past six holes, Tiger has four bogeys. The birdie at No. 1 helped negate most of that damage ... but Tiger's back to 1-under again—right on the current cut line.8:13: On his 30th hole of the day, Tiger is showing some obvious signs of being tired. And who could blame him—he's been playing golf for nearly 10 hours straight. From 165 yards out at the third hole, Tiger Woods tries to chop out a 6-iron and comes out of it. His ball comes to rest short of the green. With sunset in Pacific Palisades being 5:30 local time, this group will have time for maybe one more hole today.8:04: Tiger follows up that eagle putt at No. 1 with a bogey at the second hole. The third bogey of his second round moves Tiger back to 2-under overall.7:56: After a long wait at the second hole, Tiger sprays his second shot from 235 out with a fairway wood out to the right. He'll have his work cut out from the front right bunker to save par at the 482-yard par 4.7:40: This is exactly what Tiger Woods needed: He rolls in his 43-foot eagle putt at his 10th hole (the first) to get back to 3-under—negating those two bogeys he made on his front nine. What a putt! With the flagstick in!https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096570892669206529Tiger made a disappointing par to open his first round earlier today at the first hole. The unlikely eagle makes up for that effort—and could turn around Tiger's second round in a dramatic way. Tiger goes from toeing the cut line at 1-under to now all of a sudden being T-21.7:28: Tiger finds the fairway at the par-5 first hole, the group's 10th hole of their second round, as he attempts to get a shot back here after bogeying two of his final three holes on his front nine. Neither bogey was particularly bad—the 18th hole is playing brutally tough right now uphill and into the wind with the rain, making it even more of a challenging hole. And his break at 16 was very unlucky.7:16: Tiger and JT are gonna have their work cut out to save par at the 18th hole (their ninth). Each player had fairway wood approaches and tried playing a big cut. JT was way up left on the hill—Tiger was closer. He went high with his approach and will have about 11 feet left for par.Tiger misses the par putt, so he'll drop a shot along with JT as they make the turn. Tiger moves back to 1-under after 27 holes. That's where the cut line currently is—so all of a sudden, Tiger must be concerned about making the cut.7:01: Following Justin Thomas throwing a dart at the 17th to about 3 feet, Tiger puts his wedge shot from under 100 yards to outside 20 feet, so he'll be disappointed with that effort. The birdie putt misses on the high side, and Tiger taps in for par to remain at 2-under. His playing partner and buddy Justin Thomas stays hot, rolling in a fourth straight birdie to get to 9-under—tied for the lead with Adam Scott. Really impressive golf here from JT.6:54: The rain is really coming down now as the players head to the 17th hole. Tiger finds the fairway at the par-5 17th hole, but it was a short one—he has 326 yards left. Most players have been laying up at this par 5 all day.6:43: From a brutal position up against the back lip of the bunker, Tiger hacks it out—and somehow keeps the ball on the green, albeit the back portion. His par attempt from 44 feet away here comes up three feet shy. Tiger makes his bogey to move back to 2-under.Meanwhile, Justin Thomas is officially on fire. He has another birdie after a fabulous tee shot at 16. It's now two Kentucky boys tied at the top: Justin Thomas and J.B. Holmes (-8).https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10965576791939317766:39: Tiger will have serious lie issues at the par-3 16th hole. His tee shot came to rest up against the back lip of the bunker. As Billy Kratzert just remarked on PGA Tour Live, Tiger will do well just to keep this ball on the green. Though he avoided dropping a shot on his last hole, there might be a bogey in his future here.6:35: A clutchhh par save by Tiger at the 15th hole makes up for his poor chip—and Tiger keeps the momentum going on his second round, as he stays 3-under for the tournament and 2-under on the round.Justin Thomas, also in Tiger's group, holed out from in front of the green for birdie at the 14th hole, and he makes a long birdie putt at 15 to get to 7-under—just one back of fellow Kentucky native J.B. Holmes.6:32: A poor chip shot from Tiger at the 15th hole leaves him about 13 feet away. He'll need to convert that putt to prevent dropping his first shot of his second round.6:24: Tiger finds another fairway here at Riviera, this one at the 15th hole. The guy is feeeling it with his driver. Almost on auto pilot. His approach from 190 out turns a little too much, finding the rough to the left of the green. He'll have to get up and down to avoid dropping one here.6:20: From 20 feet out, Tiger's birdie bid comes up shy—never really scaring the hole, despite getting a good look at the line from Rory's putt. Tiger taps in for par to remain at 3-under.The putter has been disappointing for Tiger all day: He had 34 putts in his first round, including four three-putts, just the third time in his career he's done that.6:13: Tiger puts his tee shot at the par-3 14th hole just inside Rory's ball—about 20 feet right of the hole. He'll get a little teach from Rory's putt, too, as Tiger continues to hit it well today.6:07: Tiger just misses the left-to-right curling bid for birdie, leaving himself with an easy par at 13. He stays 3-under for the tournament and -2 through four on his round.Tiger's playing partners are also playing well—Rory has three birdies in his first four holes to get to 2-under. Look out for Rory at rainy Riviera. And Justin Thomas, despite hitting his tee shot out of bounds at 13, got up and down from 160 yards to avoid dropping multiple shots. He's now 5-under after that bogey.6:02: Another grooved tee shot for Tiger Woods at the 13th hole puts him in good position. He turned over his tee shot—putting his draw in the middle of the fairway at the dogleg left. Tiger spins his approach back to about 15 feet, just off the green in the fringe. He'll have a chance to knock another one here and keep the momentum going.5:51: Bang! Tiger nails the 25-footer for birdie at the 12th hole to add a second birdie to his card through three holes. Realistically, too, it could be three straight birdies for Tiger. But the 14-time major champion is now 2-under through 3—T-3 for the tournament (T-19)—and carries some strong momentum on his side at the start of his second round ... as the rain is coming down at Riviera.5:46: Tiger hits his approach hole high—about 25 feet from 181 yards. He'll have another chance to add a birdie to his third round.Tiger's currently at 2-under, which puts him at T-29. The projected cut is at 1-under—so he's comfortably inside the number as of now. But there's a ton of golf to be played, obviously.5:41: Tiger finds the fairway with his driver at the par-4 12th hole. The 12th usually plays as one of the toughest holes at Riviera—we'll see if Tiger can take advantage of his position here in the fairway.5:33: An excellent fairway-wood second shot by Tiger put him right in front of the par-5 11th green in two. But a very poor approach putt for his third leaves him more than 10 feet away. His birdie try slides by for a very disappointing par being so close in 2. That should've been a golden opportunity to start his second round with two birdies—instead, Tiger stays at 2-under.5:12: Tiger goes high with his pitch—having to navigate around the front bunker, and plays it nicely—spinning it about 7 feet short of the hole. So Tiger will have a good look for an opening birdie to start his second round. Tiger converts the birdie putt to move to 2-under.5:02: Only a little more than a half hour after finishing his first round, Tiger Woods (-1) -- along with Justin Thomas (-5) and Rory McIlroy (+1) -- has teed off in his second round. The group started on the drivable 10th hole, and Tiger has driven his tee shot just off the green. He'll have a chance to put his pitch shot close to start his second round with a birdie.4:24: Tiger narrowly misses the birdie putt at the 18th hole, so he'll tap in for a par and an opening-round, one-under 70 at Riviera. Having three-putted for a fourth time on the 17th hole to drop a shot in disappointing fashion, Tiger will head to his second round a bit frustrated. But the four consecutive birdies showed him being able to score well at Riviera, where he has never won.Tiger, JT (who birdied 18 to finish at 5-under) and Rory will head right back for their second round in this marathon day for them.4:18: Tiger responds to that shocking three-putt with a perfect drive and a towering 6-iron on Riviera's famed 18th. Woods is in good shape to at least make par the difficult hole, but as we've seen all day, a two-putt is anything but automatic.Here's an unusual stat on Tiger three-putting four times this afternoon. He's making some history in a bad way...https://twitter.com/JustinRayGolf/status/10965196250582507574:06: So much for the momentum. . . After a decent approach shot that spins back to about 20 feet, Woods runs his birdie putt a couple feet by and. . . gulp. . . misses the comebacker from about two feet. Wow. That's four three-putts on the day as Tiger falls back to one under with one hole to play.3:57: Uh-oh, it's raining in southern California again. Meanwhile, Woods is plodding his way up the par-5 17th. After pulling his drive into the left rough and drawing a poor lie, Woods pushed his layup slightly into the first cut of the right rough. He'll have a some sort of wedge to a back-right hole location.3:50: Tiger's tee shot was tracking on the par-3 16th, but it comes up about 30 feet short. From there, he two-putts for par to remain at two under. Justin Thomas makes his 10-foot birdie effort to move to four under, while Rory McIlroy remains at one over. McIlroy hast two holes to avert his first over-par score of 2019.3:40: After another great drive and a solid approach, Woods races his birdie attempt nearly five feet past the hole. But he keeps the overall positive momentum going by converting the par putt to remain at two under. Tiger has three more holes to play. At least, before he gets a lunch break.3:24: BANG! There's the bounce back from Tiger. It just came one hole later. And from farther away as Woods drains his 12-footer for birdie on No. 14.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096507996031467520Woods is now back to two under, five shots behind Jordan Spieth, who has to be pleased to still be in front by two despite these soft conditions.3:17: Tiger hits a great shot on the difficult par-3 14th hole to about 15 feet. He'll have a good look at birdie coming up. In the meantime, here's a look at how the leader board stands with Jordan Spieth still leading the way.Jordan Spieth (-7) 2t. Tony Finau (-5) 2t. Patrick Rodgers (-5) 2t. Kramer Hickok (-5) 2t. Davis Love III (-5) 2t. Adam Scott (-5) 2t. J.B. Homes (-5)Click here for full scores.3:13: Woods stuck his approach to about four feet below the hole on No. 13. A bounce back birdie looked like a forgone conclusion until he pushed his effort. Woof. That's two three-putts and two short misses on the greens for Tiger today. He remains at one under. Meanwhile, Rory McIlroy, after getting to two under through eight, has fallen to one over after back-to-back bogeys. Justin Thomas, the third player in the group, continues to lead this trio at three under.3:05: After hitting fade after fade, Woods steps to the 13th tee and rips a draw around the corner, perfectly setting up his next shot. Good to see him working it both ways with ease.3:01: Tiger pushed his tee shot into the right rough, then hit a fantastic recovery shot from a thick lie onto the green. He had a long look at birdie that rolled about four feet past, leaving him with a tricky left-to-right par putt, which he missed. That's three three putts on the day for Woods, and he's still one under.2:39: Not the best chip from Woods, as he left himself about six feet for birdie, but he makes it anyway. Four straight for Tiger to get to two under for the day.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10964952191957975042:30: Woods rips a 3-wood from 269 to just in front of the green. Hate to jinx him, but there's no reason he shouldn't easily make his fourth straight birdie here (ducks).2:20: Three in a row for Woods as he rolls in another at No. 10 and moves to one under. If he finds the fairway again at the 11th, four in a row will be in his sights. Meanwhile, Rory makes his par to stay at one under and JT ends up holing his 10 footer for birdie to get to four under. Finally a little bit of JUICE from this threesome.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096489287753711616https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096489787672780800By the way, it looks like we know when they'll be heading back out for round two later today. Here's an update from the Tiger Tracker:https://twitter.com/GCTigerTracker/status/1096481806067523585That should give them enough time to get at least 11 or 12 holes in.At the 11th, Woods stripes another drive down the fairway. He's really starting to cook.2:12: Tiger's shot was a tad more difficult than we thought, as he had to avoid a bunker and take it up high to get it back to the pin. He was successful, sticking it to about three feet. Hell of a shot. Even better was Rory's shot, as he flopped it from a nice lie and got it to hang on just off the back of the green and stay out of the back bunker. Thomas, who had the easiest shot, put too much spin on his chip, leaving himself with about 10 feet for birdie.2:07: Finally, Tiger, Rory and JT hit their tee shots, and it looks like the ensuing entertainment will be well worth the wait. Tiger is in the collection area left of the green, where he has a straightforward chip that should set him up with a good chance to make birdie. Thomas is just in front of the green, and he'll have a great chance to make a birdie as well. Rory ... um ... not so much. He's in the rough with a greenside bunker in front of him and a pin he won't be able to get close to, and just holding the green would be a miracle.1:52: Woods drains his four-footer for bird and turns in even par 35. Real strong finish to his opening nine, and now it looks like he'll have a long wait at the 10th. DeChambeau, Kuchar and Rahm have still yet to hit their tee shots.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10964831254067896321:47: Tiger had just 122 left to the green and stuck one in there close. He has four feet left for birdie to turn in even par, which would be a small victory after that ugly three putt back at No. 7. Not to mention he'll have a prime opportunity to get into red figures at the driveable par-4 10th.1:41: Woods cranks another high fade right down the middle with the driver at No. 9. With the tees up today, he'll have a low iron in his hand for his approach.1:34: And he's on the board! Woods bounces back with a birdie putt from 15 feet, getting him back to one over. We'll see if that gets him going before making the turn.1:30: From 125 yards out, Woods hit a wedge and hated it from the second he made contact. While he did pull it, he's still hole high and inside 20 feet. Hideki Matsuyama-esque move from Tiger.1:24: Woods rips one right down the middle at the par-4 eighth. Should have a short iron in.1:15: Tiger's birdie putt was actually from just off the green on the fringe, and he rolled it by some four feet. Then, he missed the comebacker for par, dropping to two over on the day. Oof.1:09: Fairway and a green for Woods at the seventh. Good look at birdie coming up to get back to level par.12:58: Another hole, another par for Woods, who two-putted from 24 feet on the par-3 sixth. In the group up ahead, though, Jon Rahm is making a move at three under through six.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/109646557828021452912:47: Another meh hole for Tiger on No. 5, just missing the fairway with his tee shot, finding the front of the green with a so-so approach, and two-putting for another par from 43 feet. Woods remains at one over through five holes while his playing partners, McIlroy and Thomas, both remain at one under.12:42: As Matt Kuchar's ball is in the air on the par-3 sixth, a fan yells, \"Go low—just not with the gratuity!\" Despite Matt maintaining this is \"not a story,\" it is. And this won't be the last comment like this.12:29: Woods hit a nice shot to about 15 feet on the par-3 fourth, but ran his birdie effort by the hole. Still one over. Still no highlights. At least, from Tiger. Here was Spieth's closing birdie from about an hour ago, because there is not much else exciting going on right now.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/109644546143346688112:17: Another missed fairway and another short approach from Tiger on the par-4 third. Although, Woods found the putting surface, he was unable to two-putt from 63 feet, missing a seven-footer for par after badly misreading his first putt. That drops Tiger to one over through three holes. Not a lot of highlights so far. . .12:02: Tiger misses right off the tee on No. 2 then comes up short on another approach. But his pitch shot nearly goes down, leaving him with a tap-in par. Even par through two holes.11:49: After that perfect opening tee shot, Tiger hit a hideous approach with a 5-iron that came up way short in a fairway bunker. From there, he hit his third to 10 feet but missed the putt to walk away with a disappointing par. Both of Tiger's playing partners, McIlroy and Thomas, make birdie.11:38: Matt Kuchar just misses his eagle attempt from 25 feet on No. 1, but taps in for birdie. Kuchar has been in the news a lot this week over a caddie controversy dating back to his win at the Mayakoba Golf Classic. A controversy he didn't help with his comments on Wednesday. Is it possible some of those \"Kuuuuch\" shouts will turn to \"Mooooch\"? Kinda sounded like it on the first hole. . .11:34: Jordan Spieth is in with a seven-under-par 64 to take the early lead. Spieth needed only 21 putts during his bogey-free round. Of course, starting tournaments hasn't been a problem for Spieth of late. Finishing, however, has been a different story. Incredibly, Spieth is looking for his first win since the 2017 British Open and his first top 5 since last year's Masters.11:32: Woods smashes a driver off the first tee that finds the fairway. The opening par 5 at Riviera is essentially a long par 4 and one of the easiest holes on the PGA Tour all year so Tiger is thinking at least birdie after that tee shot.10:53: So far, so good on the Friday weather:https://twitter.com/GCTigerTracker/status/1096437235262533632And with lift, clean and place in play (for at least the first round), low scores are out there. Let's set the over/under on the Par-71 layout at 68.5.10:45: We are approximately 45 minutes away from Tiger's tee time and it's another major champ who is already off to a fantastic start. Jordan Spieth has the lead at six under through 15 holes. Spieth leads Patrick Rodgers by one and then there's a big group at four under, including Bill Haas, who is playing in the event a year after being involved in a car accident during last year's tournament that killed a friend he was staying with. Make sure you read Brian Wacker's piece from earlier in the week on how Haas is still trying to move on from that tragedy.10:35: As we move within an hour from Tiger teeing off, check out GOLFTV's latest behind-the-scenes video with Woods in which he says his bag has up to 16(!) golf gloves during rainy rounds and he explains why he doesn't like wearing rain jackets:https://twitter.com/GOLFTV/status/1096246456795697153\"Pops used to say, 'Once you're wet, you're wet.

Once he started running the front office, his blinking at Paul George on national TV contributed to the Lakers getting fined again for tampering. Johnson’s praise of Giannis Antetokounmpo drew yet another tampering fine.So, though he escaped punishment for his recent comments on 76ers guard Ben Simmons, Johnson refused to answer a question about Hornets guard Kemba Walker.Carolina Blitz:Asked Magic about Kemba and he said y’all aren’t going to catch him slipping anymore. pic.twitter.com/sQZtIWnQbn— Carolina Blitz (@KeepBlitzin) February 15, 2019Johnson:You know I can’t answer any questions about no players, because every time I do it, I get fined. But anybody else do it, they don’t get fined. So I’m going to stay away from that one.I don’t blame Johnson for feeling that way.Other teams’ owners, coaches and executives have repeatedly publicly discussed rival players without facing announced punishment.To be fair, the NBA doesn’t reveal every fine. Bucks owner Marc Lasry reportedly just got fined for tampering, but the league never announced it. But, at minimum, there’s an inconsistency with how the NBA exposes Johnson’s transgressions.Even NBA commissioner Adam Silver said last year there’s a spotlight on the Lakers due to prior tampering. That strikes me as unfair. The Lakers already paid for their prior violations and should now be held to the same standard as everyone else.And for what it’s worth, I wish that standard allowed an all-time great point guard like Johnson to publicly share his thoughts on Kemba Walker.Gareth Bale has landed himself in hot water after La Liga denounced the Real Madrid star for his celebration in the Madrid derby, which could carry a ban of four to 12 games.The Welsh forward scored as a substitute in the 3-1 victory over Atletico Madrid, bringing up his 100th goal for the club.And during the celebrations that followed, Bale \"lifted his right arm near his head in a clear sign of provocation towards the fans, then giving a gesture which could be seen as obscene and disdainful by folding his arm and striking it with his other hand.\"In a statement released by La Liga, Bale’s punishment will be decided by whether he incited the crowd or not.If Bale is guilty of “inciting opposition fans” to cause a hostile reaction, the punishment could carry four to 12 games, if there was no hostile reaction but intent, then it could be as little as one to three games.The gesture is referred to in Spain as ‘corte de mangas,’ with the moment not picked up in the referee’s match report.A committee will now decide whether the gesture merits a punishment.Bale also featured in Real’s Champions League victory over Ajax.Los Blancos take a 2-1 lead back to the Bernabeu for the second leg of the last 16 tie after Marco Asensio’s late winner.Earlier this week Heisman Trophy winner — and first round draft pick of the Oakland Athletics — Kyler Murray chose football over baseball, committing himself to the NFL draft. It was a move that, however sensible from Murray’s point of view, has led to a lot of soul-searching among baseball folks and has raised questions about what the sport offers young, talented athletes with other options.It’s not that bleak, however! Another outstanding college football player said no to football this week and reaffirmed his commitment to baseball. Tim Tebow! From PFT:One Florida Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback will not be coaching another in the Alliance of American Football.Steve Spurrier, the Florida Heisman winner who later coached the Gators to a national championship and is now head coach of the AAF’s Orlando Apollos, said this morning on PFT Live that after the AAF briefly reached out to Tebow in the ball, it became clear that Tebow’s focus is on playing baseball.Ok, so maybe Tebow is not turning down quite the football opportunity that Murray would’ve been. But take your victories where you can get them, baseball.Follow @craigcalcaterraPhil Mickelson is on an all-time heater in the early portion of the 2019 season. In the last month alone he's won his 44th PGA Tour event, finished second in another, hit every fairway in a round for the first time in 21 years, shot a 60, pulled off this impossible recovery shot, gone viral just by rolling his eyes and said he might drop the Players from his schedule because he's already won it (a literal mic drop). The man simply cannot be stopped right now.Leave it to the weather to literally rain on Lefty's parade. On Thursday at the Genesis Open, Mickelson began his first round at the difficult short par-4 10th and drove into one of the bunkers up near the green, leaving him with a dreaded lengthy sand shot. He wound up hitting it over the green, and his ball plugged in the back bunker, setting up an even harder shot than he just had. As you'll hear PGA Tour Live commentator Shane Bacon say, avoiding making a six was probably the goal, but after Mickelson hit his third into another bunker on the other side of the green, a six suddenly became best-case scenario. How does a four sound instead?https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096076528142626818Find us a more Phil Mickelson par ever... you can't. He's always got a flair for the dramatic. The problem? It's not going to count, as the tour wiped scores from the first 30 minutes of play due to the weather, thus making this the greatest par that never counted. It still counts in his mind though:https://twitter.com/PhilMickelson/status/1096106399958937605Peak Phil.RELATED: Where does Phil Mickelson rank among the greatest OMGs? (Old man golfers)The dust is barely settled in the wake of the end of the Markelle Fultz era in Philadelphia, and the former 76ers guard is already taking shots at his old team.His old coach Brett Brown in particular.Fultz had his introductory press conference with the Orlando Magic on Thursday after being traded at last week’s deadline and praised his new coach Steve Clifford while taking a veiled shot at Brown.“It just excites me to know that I have a coach that’s going to push you to be better and not just going to tell you what you want to hear,” Fultz said.That’s direct praise for his new coach. But the message for Brown is clear. Fultz didn’t like what he heard from the Philadelphia coaching staff.Fultz never had any public dispute with the 76ers, but it was evident that he and the team had different approaches to the struggles that saw him shoot 41.4 percent from the field, 26.7 percent from 3-point distance and 53.4 percent from the line in limited action after being selected as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2017 draft.It’s still not clear whether injury or a mental block – or both – are the cause of his shooting issues.After his agent announced that the nerve disorder thoracic outlet syndrome was the root of the shooting woes, Fultz never played again for the 76ers.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]Fultz appears to be fully embracing the fresh start in Orlando as a player and a person.“I think the biggest thing we talked about what doing thing the right way,” Fultz said. “Just building me up both as a man and on the court. I think that’s music to my ears, really just. Two things I really want to do is be the best player I can be and be the best young man I can be.”Fultz described the experience of his nerve disorder to reporters.“It’s hard to lift up your arms, you lose feeling in your fingers,” Fultz said. “You can’t tell when it’s going to happen. It’s not like you do the same motion every time. You get tingling in your fingers, numbness. Stuff like that.”He also curtly dismissed any notion that his shooting struggles are due to anything but injury.“I had an injury,” Fultz said. “I was out there trying to play through that. I never lost confidence.”Asked about a timetable to return, Fultz dodged the question to talk about rehab.“Right now it’s just about getting everything the right way,” he said. “Rehab’s been going great. I’m just taking my time and doing everything the right way.”More from Yahoo Sports: • PGA Tour pro defends paying caddie $5K on $1.3M win • NFL bars NCAA’s all-time sack leader from combine • Only one NBA team failed to scout Antetokounmpo • Black History honor for Kaepernick sacked by lawmakers He might not be well known to NFL fans at large, but New England Patriots fans know linebacker Kyle Van Noy — acquired basically for free from the Detroit Lions at the 2016 trade deadline — has been a big part of the defense the last two years, and has a knack for making plays at the right time.Van Noy is getting a little shine after winning his second Super Bowl ring with New England, appearing on the “Pardon My Take” podcast on Thursday to dish on all things Patriots and Super Bowl LIII.One thing that Van Noy revealed: the Los Angeles Rams didn’t do anything surprising during the game on offense.“I couldn’t believe that,” Van Noy said. “They really didn’t do — not one wrinkle. I was like, ‘What the hell?’ They’ve got so many good players, they’ve got so many things they’ve done all year, and the one play they gave us which was a wrinkle was the [Brandin] Cooks screen that hit for a little bit.“And that was it… Or maybe too, we were playing so good they were like, ‘[Expletive], we don’t know what to do.’ ”Hindsight, of course, is 20-20, but given that the Patriots’ coaching staff is known for having its players prepared for any and everything, it seems unwise that Los Angeles didn’t add some new plays or looks to try to stump New England.Van Noy said the Patriots’ culture, specifically coach Bill Belichick’s practice of not sparing anyone in the film room, even Tom Brady, is part of why the team continues to win.“Oh yeah. Yeah, that [stuff is] sick, to be honest, because it sets the table,” Van Noy said. “Like, OK, it doesn’t matter who you are, everyone’s on an even playing field. This is how it is here at work. You come in and you earn everything.“And I respect that because I felt like that gave me a chance to get on the field when I came in mid-year, and [Belichick] was like, ‘It doesn’t matter who you are or what you’ve done. You earn your keep.’ ”More from Yahoo Sports: • Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight \n"

Yahoo Sports' Charles Robinson and Amanda Borges address the settlement between the players and the NFL, and what it means for their continuing efforts to promote social activism.The NBA jerseys of the future have a new feature to them: the ability to customize them after purchase by changing the name and number.In an awkward reveal reminiscent of a tech presentation, NBA commissioner Adam Silver and sportscaster Ahmad Rashad demonstrated the jersey at the NBA Tech Summit on Friday ahead of All-Star Weekend in Charlotte, switching a No. 30 Stephen Curry jersey to No. 23 Michael Jordan threads.Adam Silver just revealed the NBA jersey of the future that changes the name and number 🤯(via @NBA)pic.twitter.com/cgJk7KcIIU— Yahoo Sports (@YahooSports) February 15, 2019If Silver is trying to pull a Steve Jobs, perhaps he should stick to his day job. But in all seriousness, the jersey presents some interesting questions: Will it be easier for fans to “bandwagon”? Can players switch jerseys mid-game? Will Drake be first in line for this new prop?Meanwhile, Twitter had all of the jokes.Jersey cost only 20 easy installments of, $999.99.— Vod Kanockers (@JHoward2716) February 15, 2019Kevin Durant can now switch teams mid game with these new #NBA jerseys 😳 pic.twitter.com/a01rMkiexr— OT Sports Podcast Network (@OTSportsPod) February 15, 2019This could go one of two ways: Either the NBA will have found another way to separate itself from the other sports leagues or it will be a pointless feature that exists just because there is the technology to make it happen and for Twitter to crack jokes. In any case, you have to admit the NBA never fails to entertain.More from Yahoo Sports: • Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight When spring training camps opened this week around Major League Baseball, it brought hope that maybe, finally, Bryce Harper and Manny Machado would sign with teams and baseball’s long free-agent freeze would melt away.Nope. Not yet. Not only has that not happened, something else did happen: a number of talented young players around the league have agreed to team-friendly contract extensions.The latest was New York Yankees ace Luis Severino, who on Friday reportedly agreed to a four-year, $40 million deal. The deal, first reported by Joel Sherman of the New York Post, would buy up Severino’s arbitration years and comes with a $15 million club option for his first year of free agency.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]By agreeing to this deal, the Yankees and Severino avoid arbitration for 2019. He’ll make $4 million this season, $10 million next, then $10.25 million in 2021 and $11 million in 2022. The club option is for 2023. In the grand scheme of society, this is a very generous contract. In baseball’s economic bubble, it’s another young player signing for below-market value relative to his skills and potential.It’s hard to blame Severino for taking the deal, looking around at a free-agent world where Harper and Machado are still available, as are Dallas Keuchel and Craig Kimbrel. Especially since we haven’t heard even slight grumblings about teams being interested in Keuchel and Kimbrel.Coming off a breakout season in which he went 19-8 with a 3.39 ERA, the 25-year-old Severino was given a deal that’s pretty hard to turn down: “Do you want $40 million guaranteed, yes or no?”The other players faced with a similar question this week were Philadelphia Phillies ace Aaron Nola, who said yes to a four-year, $45 million deal Wednesday. It also avoided arbitration and bought out two of Nola’s free agency years, making it the most below-market deal of any of these.The Minnesota Twins locked up two of their talented young players Thursday, as right fielder Max Kepler agreed to a five-year, $35 million deal with a $10 million club option for 2024. It buys out three years of free agency for Kepler, 26. Shortstop Jorge Polanco also agreed to a five-year extension, his is worth $25.75 million with two option years that could keep him in Minnesota through 2025.In a vacuum, these types of extensions look like win-wins: The players get guaranteed money as they’re coming off good seasons. The clubs get cost-certainty to help them navigate the future — whether it’s the Yankees and Phillies trying to add big free agents this year or next, or a team like the Twins striving for contention with a homegrown core.In a bigger sense, though, it’s hard not to look at these deals in the current state of free agency and wonder if they’re a symptom of something else. Is it the market correcting itself? Is it baseball’s economy morphing into something new? Or maybe it’s just players looking around and saying, “Well, I better get my money now.”According to numerous reports, there’s a fear that for this generation of young players the light at the end of the tunnel — the big free-agency payday — won’t be there for them in the same way it was for so many other players.So while it’s great that stars like Justin Verlander, Clayton Kershaw and Max Scherzer are publicly speaking out about the current state of free agency, they’re on the right side of it. They got their mega deals.The younger players find themselves in a different sort of peril. It’s entirely possible that these are the biggest paydays these players ever get, which is a much different economic model that we’ve seen from baseball in the past.Whether it’s right or wrong — and that’s certainly something that’s up for debate heading into the next collective-bargaining agreement — baseball’s economy has often been backward. Players get paid less, relative to the market, in their pre-free agency years. The best recent example is Mike Trout winning the MVP in 2014 at age 22 while making $1 million.He got a raise to $6 million the next season, but in 2015 was still making a fraction of what people like Ryan Howard ($25M), Albert Pujols ($24M), Joe Mauer ($23M), Mark Teixeira ($22.5M) and Jose Reyes ($22M) were making.But that overpay is a necessary part baseball’s economic ecosystem too. It’s a fact: Players get overpaid as their careers decline. It’s almost like baseball’s way of making up for underpaying players during their early years. It’s baseball’s golden parachute. What’s happening these days is fewer teams are accepting that overpay as part of the how the system works.In the past few years, arbitration salaries have gotten higher and higher, and teams have tried harder to lock up younger stars before free agency. It’s why we’ve see players like Madison Bumgarner, Chris Archer, Chris Sale and Paul Goldschmidt become valuable trade chips for their team-friendly contract extensions.Teams are getting smarter about where their money goes, and how to keep value in their assets. These extensions to Severino, Nola and the rest show that they’re willing to spend money, just in the way that they want.Earlier this week, former Miami Marlins president David Samson tweeted something in response to Justin Verlander, saying the “broken system” talk was wrong. Players and their agents, Samson said, needed to adjust to a “new reality.”He may be right about the new reality part. The monster paydays at the end of the free agency tunnel could be fading away. If Bryce Harper and Manny Machado can’t get them, who can?The new reality could be players seizing their money. Whenever they can.– – – – – –Mike Oz is a writer at Yahoo Sports.

However, Wainwright framed the situation with a little more urgency on Friday by expressing concerns that a day of reckoning could happen sooner than later.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]Speaking to InsideSTL.com’s Tim McKernan, Wainwright said it was inevitable that the players will go on strike unless major changes are made to help bridge the widening gap. But he’s also worried that frustrations could reach a boiling point during the season leading to some form of a revolt. Perhaps even a mid-season walkout.#STLCards pitcher Adam Wainwright on @TMASTL: “Unless something changes, there’s going to be a strike. 100%. I’m just worried people are going to walk-out mid-season.” pic.twitter.com/M8WeRVcASe— Tim McKernan (@tmckernan) February 15, 2019“Unless something changes, there’s going to be a strike. 100%,” Wainwright said regarding the free-agent freeze that has left stars like Bryce Harper and Manny Machado without contracts. “I’m just worried people are going to walkout midseason.”It’s conceivable given the current climate, but a players revolt on that level still feels like a long shot. The target date we should all still be looking at is Dec. 1, 2021. That’s when the current collective bargaining agreement ends and the owners will be forced to come to the table.That doesn’t mean we should just dismiss Wainwright’s concerns about a 2019 strike. While they might feel a little on the dramatic side, the frustration that has built all offseason as dozens of free agents, including and especially Harper and Machado, remain unsigned is becoming more palpable by the day. There’s a genuine feeling that owners are determined to cut back on salaries even as profits continue to reach new heights, it’s possible the players’ patience will run out if the free-agent freeze continues to drag on. Wainwright thinks so, and he’s far from alone.In Friday’s interview, the 37-year-old right-hander also criticized owners and front offense personnel for placing too much emphasis on “analytics” and placing everything in a “sabermetric box” that discounts intangibles and other immeasurable aspects of baseball.Adam Wainwright said today on ⁦@TMASTL⁩ that he expects there to be a strike “100%.”The context of the conversation comes from a discussion on how Bryce Harper and Manny Machado are still without teams.You can see Wainwright’s reasoning in the video below. pic.twitter.com/GXsmx4cXk1— Tim McKernan (@tmckernan) February 15, 2019Wainwright admitted that there’s always risk in making long-term financial commitments to players, but emphasized that doing so marks a commitment to winning that several teams seemingly lack.“Part of it is smart from their side of it, but you have to realize it’s about winning. So, if Bryce Harper wants 10 years and he’s 26 years old. He’s going to be a dynamic player. The same can be said about Manny Machado. These guys are superstar players.”The deeper we get into it the more obvious it is that the players know what battles lie ahead. The only real question is how much worse it will get before any progress is made toward a satisfactory resolution.More from Yahoo Sports:• Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight MLB rumors: Bryce Harper has made his decision, says D.C. radio host originally appeared on nbcsportsbayarea.comA report has come out from the East Coast saying Bryce Harper has come to a decision on which team he will play for in 2019 and beyond.Chris Russell, a sports radio talk show host from 106.7 The Fan in Washington D.C., (who has been on the Harper beat for some time) said the free agent slugger could make a decision in the next 24 hours.\"Maybe I took a little bit of a leap of faith here based on some indications I got from a real good source,\" Russell told 94WIP, in Philadelphia, on Friday.\"Bryce and his representatives, (Scott) Boras, his people, his wife Kayla, they've been meeting since Monday morning in Vegas. Bryce originally wanted this done, when it took this long, by Valentine's Day. Obviously, the contract has not been announced, signed, or whatever.\"\"But I'm led to believe by the people that I've talked to that are close to the situation -- and I have, again, a real good source that has helped me through this process, let's just leave it at that,\" Russell said. \"That Bryce was in a mood to celebrate yesterday. Now, the source said, 'I believe it's done.' I don't have concrete, 100 percent proof for you guys. I wish I did, otherwise, I would have it and I would be running around with it. But I don't have that, so I want to caution everybody in Philadelphia. But that's what I was led to believe, that this thing is now decided.\"Russell then mentioned the Phillies.\"Now, what comes then is hammering out a contract. And if we were to believe the report that the Philadelphia Phillies had not even extended a formal offer -- and I assume that to be a termed, written agreement, that type of thing, which I find hard to believe -- then there might be more legwork to this. And therefore, hey the decision may be done, but the contract still needs to be ironed out.\"[RELATED: Phillies fan participates in \"lent\" in hopes of recruiting Harper]Russell is being safe with the terminology he's using, which is understandable. And while we haven't been able to confirm these rumors, Harper, along with many other free agents, remains unsigned.The Giants appeared to be the \"mystery team\" that introduced themselves late into the Harper sweepstakes -- and when the radio hosts asked Russell his opinion on where the outfielder will end up next season, he believed Harper will be in an orange and black uniform.\"I don't think it's going to be the Nationals,\" Russell said. \"I think it's going to be the San Francisco Giants, but that is not by any means an 'I know that for a fact,' so I want to caution everybody -- I know how this works -- I get in trouble with everything I say on my radio show, and everyone blows it up.\" The wait continues ... Golden State Warriors stars Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant empathised with Steve Kerr after the head coach was ejected during the loss to the Portland Trail Blazers having thrown a clipboard in response to a flagrant foul call.Kerr was enraged late in the fourth quarter when Draymond Green was called for a flagrant foul after he stopped Zach Collins from approaching the rim as he went up for a shot.That drew Kerr's ire and after ranting in one referee's face, he slammed a clipboard down to earn an ejection, with Durant having to escort his head coach back off the court.The Warriors lost the game 129-107 but will still head into the All-Star break with the best record in the Western Conference.\"It was an emotional game. We fought really hard for 43 minutes,\" Curry told reporters afterwards.\"One questionable decision - the flagrant - obviously the fire came out. You see coach go and throw a clipboard. At that point you try to get us over the hump. An eight-point swing, it's tough to overcome.\"\"I looked at the replay and the amount of ball [Green] got, there was nothing excessive about it, he got all the ball.\"There was a lot of chirping, with Zach involved. There was probably a sensitivity to it, trying to put out some fires, but I thought it was a terrible call. We obviously paid the price for it with how everything unfolded after that.\"Durant shared that sympathy having been the one to pull Kerr away from the referees as he continued to rant at them.\"I felt for him, I understand his anger and his rage, especially for that call,\" he said.\"I thought we should have just kept playing, It was a common foul, I thought. Refs looked at it differently. \"I understand why coach was a little frustrated.\"Kerr explained that it was the disbelief at the call that had triggered his reaction.\"I was just shocked that that was called a flagrant foul,\" he said. \"I'm not sure how it's determined - if it's in New York or the officials on the call - but that was head-scratching: that that could be called a flagrant foul.\"The guy's going to go in for a dunk, you've got to make sure he doesn't dunk it.\"So, I told Kenny [Mauer] that I beg to differ. There might have been a couple of other words in there too!\"I'll have to ask the owner if the clipboard broke when I threw it down. I got a little anger out so that was good. I was too busy yelling to ask for an explanation.\"Charles Barkley thinks New Orleans Pelicans star Anthony Davis made a mistake with his trade request.The 25-year-old asked the Pelicans to move him in late January and the Los Angeles Lakers had been engaged in discussions about acquiring him. But, no deal was reached before the deadline and Davis remained with New Orleans.Barkley, an 11-time All-Star who works as an analyst for TNT, said he thinks Davis and his agent, Rich Paul, mishandled the situation.\"Don't ruin your reputation as a great player, one of the nicest guys in the world,\" Barkley told reporters on Thursday ahead of All-Star weekend (via the Washington Post).\"Remember, your agent works for you, you don't work for him. They handled that situation wrong. It's going to come back to bite them in the a***. It's unfortunate.\"The six-time All-Star entered play on Thursday averaging 28.5 points and 13.1 rebounds this season. But, he scored just three points in 24 minutes on the floor in the Pelicans' 118-88 loss to the Orlando Magic earlier this week.\"This is a bad situation,\" Barkley said. \"It's a bad look for the NBA. Because that kid can't go out there and give 100 per cent because he’s worried about getting hurt. The guy's the second-best player in the world and he's got three points? That's not a good look for the NBA.\"The Boston Celtics and New York Knicks, among others, are expected to explore dealing for Davis after the season. Barkley, however, said he believes the forward will eventually land in Los Angeles because of Paul's relationship with Lakers star LeBron James.Barkley tallied 22.1 points and 11.7 rebounds per game over his 16-year career. He retired in 2000 and was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame six years later.After an apology from Sergio Garcia, a non-apology from Matt Kuchar, and an uncooperative Mother Nature on Valentine's Day, it's time for everyone to focus again on Tiger Woods. Kidding. Sort of. A weather-delayed first round at Riviera re-starts on Friday morning and the 14-time major champ will be in the Hollywood-area spotlight as he finally begins his Genesis Open. And golf fans could potentially see a LOT of the tournament host as the event tries to play catch up after heavy rains on Thursday.Woods, Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas (Decent group, eh?) are scheduled to tee off at 8:32 local time (11:32 ET). The hope is they will complete their first rounds and then play as much of their second rounds as possible before darkness. And Tiger's hope is to finally win for the first time at this historic layout where he missed the cut last year. We'll be tracking Tiger every step of the way so keep it right here for the latest scores, news and highlights. (All times eastern)SATURDAY, 11:25: With a 25-foot birdie putt on No. 9, Woods' final hole of the second round, Tiger will likely make the cut. The birdie brought Woods back to even on his round and to one under overall.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096808527694245890After resuming play in the morning, Woods bogeyed his first hole, No. 4, then made four pars before his finishing birdie. His playing partners, however, fared much better. Justin Thomas shares the lead with Adam Scott at 11 under and Rory McIlroy birdied four of his six holes on Saturday morning to shoot 63 and move to seven under through 36 holes. Thursday's early wave is now on the course for their second rounds.-------------------FRIDAY-------------------8:25: And with that, the horn has sounded—play will be suspended for darkness on Friday at Riviera. Tiger, JT and Rory have six more holes to complete their second round. Justin Thomas is at 10-under, tied with Adam Scott for the lead. Tiger will hope Saturday brings some different momentum for him—as this marathon day ends with two bogeys in a row after the highlight eagle.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10965708926692065298:21: That's back-to-back bogeys now for Tiger Woods, dropping another shot here at the third hole (his 12th of the round). And over his past six holes, Tiger has four bogeys. The birdie at No. 1 helped negate most of that damage ... but Tiger's back to 1-under again—right on the current cut line.8:13: On his 30th hole of the day, Tiger is showing some obvious signs of being tired. And who could blame him—he's been playing golf for nearly 10 hours straight. From 165 yards out at the third hole, Tiger Woods tries to chop out a 6-iron and comes out of it. His ball comes to rest short of the green. With sunset in Pacific Palisades being 5:30 local time, this group will have time for maybe one more hole today.8:04: Tiger follows up that eagle putt at No. 1 with a bogey at the second hole. The third bogey of his second round moves Tiger back to 2-under overall.7:56: After a long wait at the second hole, Tiger sprays his second shot from 235 out with a fairway wood out to the right. He'll have his work cut out from the front right bunker to save par at the 482-yard par 4.7:40: This is exactly what Tiger Woods needed: He rolls in his 43-foot eagle putt at his 10th hole (the first) to get back to 3-under—negating those two bogeys he made on his front nine. What a putt! With the flagstick in!https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096570892669206529Tiger made a disappointing par to open his first round earlier today at the first hole. The unlikely eagle makes up for that effort—and could turn around Tiger's second round in a dramatic way. Tiger goes from toeing the cut line at 1-under to now all of a sudden being T-21.7:28: Tiger finds the fairway at the par-5 first hole, the group's 10th hole of their second round, as he attempts to get a shot back here after bogeying two of his final three holes on his front nine. Neither bogey was particularly bad—the 18th hole is playing brutally tough right now uphill and into the wind with the rain, making it even more of a challenging hole. And his break at 16 was very unlucky.7:16: Tiger and JT are gonna have their work cut out to save par at the 18th hole (their ninth). Each player had fairway wood approaches and tried playing a big cut. JT was way up left on the hill—Tiger was closer. He went high with his approach and will have about 11 feet left for par.Tiger misses the par putt, so he'll drop a shot along with JT as they make the turn. Tiger moves back to 1-under after 27 holes. That's where the cut line currently is—so all of a sudden, Tiger must be concerned about making the cut.7:01: Following Justin Thomas throwing a dart at the 17th to about 3 feet, Tiger puts his wedge shot from under 100 yards to outside 20 feet, so he'll be disappointed with that effort. The birdie putt misses on the high side, and Tiger taps in for par to remain at 2-under. His playing partner and buddy Justin Thomas stays hot, rolling in a fourth straight birdie to get to 9-under—tied for the lead with Adam Scott. Really impressive golf here from JT.6:54: The rain is really coming down now as the players head to the 17th hole. Tiger finds the fairway at the par-5 17th hole, but it was a short one—he has 326 yards left. Most players have been laying up at this par 5 all day.6:43: From a brutal position up against the back lip of the bunker, Tiger hacks it out—and somehow keeps the ball on the green, albeit the back portion. His par attempt from 44 feet away here comes up three feet shy. Tiger makes his bogey to move back to 2-under.Meanwhile, Justin Thomas is officially on fire. He has another birdie after a fabulous tee shot at 16. It's now two Kentucky boys tied at the top: Justin Thomas and J.B. Holmes (-8).https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10965576791939317766:39: Tiger will have serious lie issues at the par-3 16th hole. His tee shot came to rest up against the back lip of the bunker. As Billy Kratzert just remarked on PGA Tour Live, Tiger will do well just to keep this ball on the green. Though he avoided dropping a shot on his last hole, there might be a bogey in his future here.6:35: A clutchhh par save by Tiger at the 15th hole makes up for his poor chip—and Tiger keeps the momentum going on his second round, as he stays 3-under for the tournament and 2-under on the round.Justin Thomas, also in Tiger's group, holed out from in front of the green for birdie at the 14th hole, and he makes a long birdie putt at 15 to get to 7-under—just one back of fellow Kentucky native J.B. Holmes.6:32: A poor chip shot from Tiger at the 15th hole leaves him about 13 feet away. He'll need to convert that putt to prevent dropping his first shot of his second round.6:24: Tiger finds another fairway here at Riviera, this one at the 15th hole. The guy is feeeling it with his driver. Almost on auto pilot. His approach from 190 out turns a little too much, finding the rough to the left of the green. He'll have to get up and down to avoid dropping one here.6:20: From 20 feet out, Tiger's birdie bid comes up shy—never really scaring the hole, despite getting a good look at the line from Rory's putt. Tiger taps in for par to remain at 3-under.The putter has been disappointing for Tiger all day: He had 34 putts in his first round, including four three-putts, just the third time in his career he's done that.6:13: Tiger puts his tee shot at the par-3 14th hole just inside Rory's ball—about 20 feet right of the hole. He'll get a little teach from Rory's putt, too, as Tiger continues to hit it well today.6:07: Tiger just misses the left-to-right curling bid for birdie, leaving himself with an easy par at 13. He stays 3-under for the tournament and -2 through four on his round.Tiger's playing partners are also playing well—Rory has three birdies in his first four holes to get to 2-under. Look out for Rory at rainy Riviera. And Justin Thomas, despite hitting his tee shot out of bounds at 13, got up and down from 160 yards to avoid dropping multiple shots. He's now 5-under after that bogey.6:02: Another grooved tee shot for Tiger Woods at the 13th hole puts him in good position. He turned over his tee shot—putting his draw in the middle of the fairway at the dogleg left. Tiger spins his approach back to about 15 feet, just off the green in the fringe. He'll have a chance to knock another one here and keep the momentum going.5:51: Bang! Tiger nails the 25-footer for birdie at the 12th hole to add a second birdie to his card through three holes. Realistically, too, it could be three straight birdies for Tiger. But the 14-time major champion is now 2-under through 3—T-3 for the tournament (T-19)—and carries some strong momentum on his side at the start of his second round ... as the rain is coming down at Riviera.5:46: Tiger hits his approach hole high—about 25 feet from 181 yards. He'll have another chance to add a birdie to his third round.Tiger's currently at 2-under, which puts him at T-29. The projected cut is at 1-under—so he's comfortably inside the number as of now. But there's a ton of golf to be played, obviously.5:41: Tiger finds the fairway with his driver at the par-4 12th hole. The 12th usually plays as one of the toughest holes at Riviera—we'll see if Tiger can take advantage of his position here in the fairway.5:33: An excellent fairway-wood second shot by Tiger put him right in front of the par-5 11th green in two. But a very poor approach putt for his third leaves him more than 10 feet away. His birdie try slides by for a very disappointing par being so close in 2. That should've been a golden opportunity to start his second round with two birdies—instead, Tiger stays at 2-under.5:12: Tiger goes high with his pitch—having to navigate around the front bunker, and plays it nicely—spinning it about 7 feet short of the hole. So Tiger will have a good look for an opening birdie to start his second round. Tiger converts the birdie putt to move to 2-under.5:02: Only a little more than a half hour after finishing his first round, Tiger Woods (-1) -- along with Justin Thomas (-5) and Rory McIlroy (+1) -- has teed off in his second round. The group started on the drivable 10th hole, and Tiger has driven his tee shot just off the green. He'll have a chance to put his pitch shot close to start his second round with a birdie.4:24: Tiger narrowly misses the birdie putt at the 18th hole, so he'll tap in for a par and an opening-round, one-under 70 at Riviera. Having three-putted for a fourth time on the 17th hole to drop a shot in disappointing fashion, Tiger will head to his second round a bit frustrated. But the four consecutive birdies showed him being able to score well at Riviera, where he has never won.Tiger, JT (who birdied 18 to finish at 5-under) and Rory will head right back for their second round in this marathon day for them.4:18: Tiger responds to that shocking three-putt with a perfect drive and a towering 6-iron on Riviera's famed 18th. Woods is in good shape to at least make par the difficult hole, but as we've seen all day, a two-putt is anything but automatic.Here's an unusual stat on Tiger three-putting four times this afternoon. He's making some history in a bad way...https://twitter.com/JustinRayGolf/status/10965196250582507574:06: So much for the momentum. . . After a decent approach shot that spins back to about 20 feet, Woods runs his birdie putt a couple feet by and. . . gulp. . . misses the comebacker from about two feet. Wow. That's four three-putts on the day as Tiger falls back to one under with one hole to play.3:57: Uh-oh, it's raining in southern California again. Meanwhile, Woods is plodding his way up the par-5 17th. After pulling his drive into the left rough and drawing a poor lie, Woods pushed his layup slightly into the first cut of the right rough. He'll have a some sort of wedge to a back-right hole location.3:50: Tiger's tee shot was tracking on the par-3 16th, but it comes up about 30 feet short. From there, he two-putts for par to remain at two under. Justin Thomas makes his 10-foot birdie effort to move to four under, while Rory McIlroy remains at one over. McIlroy hast two holes to avert his first over-par score of 2019.3:40: After another great drive and a solid approach, Woods races his birdie attempt nearly five feet past the hole. But he keeps the overall positive momentum going by converting the par putt to remain at two under. Tiger has three more holes to play. At least, before he gets a lunch break.3:24: BANG! There's the bounce back from Tiger. It just came one hole later. And from farther away as Woods drains his 12-footer for birdie on No. 14.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096507996031467520Woods is now back to two under, five shots behind Jordan Spieth, who has to be pleased to still be in front by two despite these soft conditions.3:17: Tiger hits a great shot on the difficult par-3 14th hole to about 15 feet. He'll have a good look at birdie coming up. In the meantime, here's a look at how the leader board stands with Jordan Spieth still leading the way.Jordan Spieth (-7) 2t. Tony Finau (-5) 2t. Patrick Rodgers (-5) 2t. Kramer Hickok (-5) 2t. Davis Love III (-5) 2t. Adam Scott (-5) 2t. J.B. Homes (-5)Click here for full scores.3:13: Woods stuck his approach to about four feet below the hole on No. 13. A bounce back birdie looked like a forgone conclusion until he pushed his effort. Woof. That's two three-putts and two short misses on the greens for Tiger today. He remains at one under. Meanwhile, Rory McIlroy, after getting to two under through eight, has fallen to one over after back-to-back bogeys. Justin Thomas, the third player in the group, continues to lead this trio at three under.3:05: After hitting fade after fade, Woods steps to the 13th tee and rips a draw around the corner, perfectly setting up his next shot. Good to see him working it both ways with ease.3:01: Tiger pushed his tee shot into the right rough, then hit a fantastic recovery shot from a thick lie onto the green. He had a long look at birdie that rolled about four feet past, leaving him with a tricky left-to-right par putt, which he missed. That's three three putts on the day for Woods, and he's still one under.2:39: Not the best chip from Woods, as he left himself about six feet for birdie, but he makes it anyway. Four straight for Tiger to get to two under for the day.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10964952191957975042:30: Woods rips a 3-wood from 269 to just in front of the green. Hate to jinx him, but there's no reason he shouldn't easily make his fourth straight birdie here (ducks).2:20: Three in a row for Woods as he rolls in another at No. 10 and moves to one under. If he finds the fairway again at the 11th, four in a row will be in his sights. Meanwhile, Rory makes his par to stay at one under and JT ends up holing his 10 footer for birdie to get to four under. Finally a little bit of JUICE from this threesome.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096489287753711616https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096489787672780800By the way, it looks like we know when they'll be heading back out for round two later today. Here's an update from the Tiger Tracker:https://twitter.com/GCTigerTracker/status/1096481806067523585That should give them enough time to get at least 11 or 12 holes in.At the 11th, Woods stripes another drive down the fairway. He's really starting to cook.2:12: Tiger's shot was a tad more difficult than we thought, as he had to avoid a bunker and take it up high to get it back to the pin. He was successful, sticking it to about three feet. Hell of a shot. Even better was Rory's shot, as he flopped it from a nice lie and got it to hang on just off the back of the green and stay out of the back bunker. Thomas, who had the easiest shot, put too much spin on his chip, leaving himself with about 10 feet for birdie.2:07: Finally, Tiger, Rory and JT hit their tee shots, and it looks like the ensuing entertainment will be well worth the wait. Tiger is in the collection area left of the green, where he has a straightforward chip that should set him up with a good chance to make birdie. Thomas is just in front of the green, and he'll have a great chance to make a birdie as well. Rory ... um ... not so much. He's in the rough with a greenside bunker in front of him and a pin he won't be able to get close to, and just holding the green would be a miracle.1:52: Woods drains his four-footer for bird and turns in even par 35. Real strong finish to his opening nine, and now it looks like he'll have a long wait at the 10th. DeChambeau, Kuchar and Rahm have still yet to hit their tee shots.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10964831254067896321:47: Tiger had just 122 left to the green and stuck one in there close. He has four feet left for birdie to turn in even par, which would be a small victory after that ugly three putt back at No. 7. Not to mention he'll have a prime opportunity to get into red figures at the driveable par-4 10th.1:41: Woods cranks another high fade right down the middle with the driver at No. 9. With the tees up today, he'll have a low iron in his hand for his approach.1:34: And he's on the board! Woods bounces back with a birdie putt from 15 feet, getting him back to one over. We'll see if that gets him going before making the turn.1:30: From 125 yards out, Woods hit a wedge and hated it from the second he made contact. While he did pull it, he's still hole high and inside 20 feet. Hideki Matsuyama-esque move from Tiger.1:24: Woods rips one right down the middle at the par-4 eighth. Should have a short iron in.1:15: Tiger's birdie putt was actually from just off the green on the fringe, and he rolled it by some four feet. Then, he missed the comebacker for par, dropping to two over on the day. Oof.1:09: Fairway and a green for Woods at the seventh. Good look at birdie coming up to get back to level par.12:58: Another hole, another par for Woods, who two-putted from 24 feet on the par-3 sixth. In the group up ahead, though, Jon Rahm is making a move at three under through six.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/109646557828021452912:47: Another meh hole for Tiger on No. 5, just missing the fairway with his tee shot, finding the front of the green with a so-so approach, and two-putting for another par from 43 feet. Woods remains at one over through five holes while his playing partners, McIlroy and Thomas, both remain at one under.12:42: As Matt Kuchar's ball is in the air on the par-3 sixth, a fan yells, \"Go low—just not with the gratuity!\" Despite Matt maintaining this is \"not a story,\" it is. And this won't be the last comment like this.12:29: Woods hit a nice shot to about 15 feet on the par-3 fourth, but ran his birdie effort by the hole. Still one over. Still no highlights. At least, from Tiger. Here was Spieth's closing birdie from about an hour ago, because there is not much else exciting going on right now.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/109644546143346688112:17: Another missed fairway and another short approach from Tiger on the par-4 third. Although, Woods found the putting surface, he was unable to two-putt from 63 feet, missing a seven-footer for par after badly misreading his first putt. That drops Tiger to one over through three holes. Not a lot of highlights so far. . .12:02: Tiger misses right off the tee on No. 2 then comes up short on another approach. But his pitch shot nearly goes down, leaving him with a tap-in par. Even par through two holes.11:49: After that perfect opening tee shot, Tiger hit a hideous approach with a 5-iron that came up way short in a fairway bunker. From there, he hit his third to 10 feet but missed the putt to walk away with a disappointing par. Both of Tiger's playing partners, McIlroy and Thomas, make birdie.11:38: Matt Kuchar just misses his eagle attempt from 25 feet on No. 1, but taps in for birdie. Kuchar has been in the news a lot this week over a caddie controversy dating back to his win at the Mayakoba Golf Classic. A controversy he didn't help with his comments on Wednesday. Is it possible some of those \"Kuuuuch\" shouts will turn to \"Mooooch\"? Kinda sounded like it on the first hole. . .11:34: Jordan Spieth is in with a seven-under-par 64 to take the early lead. Spieth needed only 21 putts during his bogey-free round. Of course, starting tournaments hasn't been a problem for Spieth of late. Finishing, however, has been a different story. Incredibly, Spieth is looking for his first win since the 2017 British Open and his first top 5 since last year's Masters.11:32: Woods smashes a driver off the first tee that finds the fairway. The opening par 5 at Riviera is essentially a long par 4 and one of the easiest holes on the PGA Tour all year so Tiger is thinking at least birdie after that tee shot.10:53: So far, so good on the Friday weather:https://twitter.com/GCTigerTracker/status/1096437235262533632And with lift, clean and place in play (for at least the first round), low scores are out there. Let's set the over/under on the Par-71 layout at 68.5.10:45: We are approximately 45 minutes away from Tiger's tee time and it's another major champ who is already off to a fantastic start. Jordan Spieth has the lead at six under through 15 holes. Spieth leads Patrick Rodgers by one and then there's a big group at four under, including Bill Haas, who is playing in the event a year after being involved in a car accident during last year's tournament that killed a friend he was staying with. Make sure you read Brian Wacker's piece from earlier in the week on how Haas is still trying to move on from that tragedy.10:35: As we move within an hour from Tiger teeing off, check out GOLFTV's latest behind-the-scenes video with Woods in which he says his bag has up to 16(!) golf gloves during rainy rounds and he explains why he doesn't like wearing rain jackets:https://twitter.com/GOLFTV/status/1096246456795697153\"Pops used to say, 'Once you're wet, you're wet.

Once he started running the front office, his blinking at Paul George on national TV contributed to the Lakers getting fined again for tampering. Johnson’s praise of Giannis Antetokounmpo drew yet another tampering fine.So, though he escaped punishment for his recent comments on 76ers guard Ben Simmons, Johnson refused to answer a question about Hornets guard Kemba Walker.Carolina Blitz:Asked Magic about Kemba and he said y’all aren’t going to catch him slipping anymore. pic.twitter.com/sQZtIWnQbn— Carolina Blitz (@KeepBlitzin) February 15, 2019Johnson:You know I can’t answer any questions about no players, because every time I do it, I get fined. But anybody else do it, they don’t get fined. So I’m going to stay away from that one.I don’t blame Johnson for feeling that way.Other teams’ owners, coaches and executives have repeatedly publicly discussed rival players without facing announced punishment.To be fair, the NBA doesn’t reveal every fine. Bucks owner Marc Lasry reportedly just got fined for tampering, but the league never announced it. But, at minimum, there’s an inconsistency with how the NBA exposes Johnson’s transgressions.Even NBA commissioner Adam Silver said last year there’s a spotlight on the Lakers due to prior tampering. That strikes me as unfair. The Lakers already paid for their prior violations and should now be held to the same standard as everyone else.And for what it’s worth, I wish that standard allowed an all-time great point guard like Johnson to publicly share his thoughts on Kemba Walker.Gareth Bale has landed himself in hot water after La Liga denounced the Real Madrid star for his celebration in the Madrid derby, which could carry a ban of four to 12 games.The Welsh forward scored as a substitute in the 3-1 victory over Atletico Madrid, bringing up his 100th goal for the club.And during the celebrations that followed, Bale \"lifted his right arm near his head in a clear sign of provocation towards the fans, then giving a gesture which could be seen as obscene and disdainful by folding his arm and striking it with his other hand.\"In a statement released by La Liga, Bale’s punishment will be decided by whether he incited the crowd or not.If Bale is guilty of “inciting opposition fans” to cause a hostile reaction, the punishment could carry four to 12 games, if there was no hostile reaction but intent, then it could be as little as one to three games.The gesture is referred to in Spain as ‘corte de mangas,’ with the moment not picked up in the referee’s match report.A committee will now decide whether the gesture merits a punishment.Bale also featured in Real’s Champions League victory over Ajax.Los Blancos take a 2-1 lead back to the Bernabeu for the second leg of the last 16 tie after Marco Asensio’s late winner.Earlier this week Heisman Trophy winner — and first round draft pick of the Oakland Athletics — Kyler Murray chose football over baseball, committing himself to the NFL draft. It was a move that, however sensible from Murray’s point of view, has led to a lot of soul-searching among baseball folks and has raised questions about what the sport offers young, talented athletes with other options.It’s not that bleak, however! Another outstanding college football player said no to football this week and reaffirmed his commitment to baseball. Tim Tebow! From PFT:One Florida Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback will not be coaching another in the Alliance of American Football.Steve Spurrier, the Florida Heisman winner who later coached the Gators to a national championship and is now head coach of the AAF’s Orlando Apollos, said this morning on PFT Live that after the AAF briefly reached out to Tebow in the ball, it became clear that Tebow’s focus is on playing baseball.Ok, so maybe Tebow is not turning down quite the football opportunity that Murray would’ve been. But take your victories where you can get them, baseball.Follow @craigcalcaterraPhil Mickelson is on an all-time heater in the early portion of the 2019 season. In the last month alone he's won his 44th PGA Tour event, finished second in another, hit every fairway in a round for the first time in 21 years, shot a 60, pulled off this impossible recovery shot, gone viral just by rolling his eyes and said he might drop the Players from his schedule because he's already won it (a literal mic drop). The man simply cannot be stopped right now.Leave it to the weather to literally rain on Lefty's parade. On Thursday at the Genesis Open, Mickelson began his first round at the difficult short par-4 10th and drove into one of the bunkers up near the green, leaving him with a dreaded lengthy sand shot. He wound up hitting it over the green, and his ball plugged in the back bunker, setting up an even harder shot than he just had. As you'll hear PGA Tour Live commentator Shane Bacon say, avoiding making a six was probably the goal, but after Mickelson hit his third into another bunker on the other side of the green, a six suddenly became best-case scenario. How does a four sound instead?https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096076528142626818Find us a more Phil Mickelson par ever... you can't. He's always got a flair for the dramatic. The problem? It's not going to count, as the tour wiped scores from the first 30 minutes of play due to the weather, thus making this the greatest par that never counted.

(Old man golfers)The dust is barely settled in the wake of the end of the Markelle Fultz era in Philadelphia, and the former 76ers guard is already taking shots at his old team.His old coach Brett Brown in particular.Fultz had his introductory press conference with the Orlando Magic on Thursday after being traded at last week’s deadline and praised his new coach Steve Clifford while taking a veiled shot at Brown.“It just excites me to know that I have a coach that’s going to push you to be better and not just going to tell you what you want to hear,” Fultz said.That’s direct praise for his new coach. But the message for Brown is clear. Fultz didn’t like what he heard from the Philadelphia coaching staff.Fultz never had any public dispute with the 76ers, but it was evident that he and the team had different approaches to the struggles that saw him shoot 41.4 percent from the field, 26.7 percent from 3-point distance and 53.4 percent from the line in limited action after being selected as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2017 draft.It’s still not clear whether injury or a mental block – or both – are the cause of his shooting issues.After his agent announced that the nerve disorder thoracic outlet syndrome was the root of the shooting woes, Fultz never played again for the 76ers.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]Fultz appears to be fully embracing the fresh start in Orlando as a player and a person.“I think the biggest thing we talked about what doing thing the right way,” Fultz said. “Just building me up both as a man and on the court. I think that’s music to my ears, really just. Two things I really want to do is be the best player I can be and be the best young man I can be.”Fultz described the experience of his nerve disorder to reporters.“It’s hard to lift up your arms, you lose feeling in your fingers,” Fultz said. “You can’t tell when it’s going to happen. It’s not like you do the same motion every time. You get tingling in your fingers, numbness. Stuff like that.”He also curtly dismissed any notion that his shooting struggles are due to anything but injury.“I had an injury,” Fultz said. “I was out there trying to play through that. I never lost confidence.”Asked about a timetable to return, Fultz dodged the question to talk about rehab.“Right now it’s just about getting everything the right way,” he said. “Rehab’s been going great. I’m just taking my time and doing everything the right way.”More from Yahoo Sports: • PGA Tour pro defends paying caddie $5K on $1.3M win • NFL bars NCAA’s all-time sack leader from combine • Only one NBA team failed to scout Antetokounmpo • Black History honor for Kaepernick sacked by lawmakers He might not be well known to NFL fans at large, but New England Patriots fans know linebacker Kyle Van Noy — acquired basically for free from the Detroit Lions at the 2016 trade deadline — has been a big part of the defense the last two years, and has a knack for making plays at the right time.Van Noy is getting a little shine after winning his second Super Bowl ring with New England, appearing on the “Pardon My Take” podcast on Thursday to dish on all things Patriots and Super Bowl LIII.One thing that Van Noy revealed: the Los Angeles Rams didn’t do anything surprising during the game on offense.“I couldn’t believe that,” Van Noy said. “They really didn’t do — not one wrinkle. I was like, ‘What the hell?’ They’ve got so many good players, they’ve got so many things they’ve done all year, and the one play they gave us which was a wrinkle was the [Brandin] Cooks screen that hit for a little bit.“And that was it… Or maybe too, we were playing so good they were like, ‘[Expletive], we don’t know what to do.’ ”Hindsight, of course, is 20-20, but given that the Patriots’ coaching staff is known for having its players prepared for any and everything, it seems unwise that Los Angeles didn’t add some new plays or looks to try to stump New England.Van Noy said the Patriots’ culture, specifically coach Bill Belichick’s practice of not sparing anyone in the film room, even Tom Brady, is part of why the team continues to win.“Oh yeah. Yeah, that [stuff is] sick, to be honest, because it sets the table,” Van Noy said. “Like, OK, it doesn’t matter who you are, everyone’s on an even playing field. This is how it is here at work. You come in and you earn everything.“And I respect that because I felt like that gave me a chance to get on the field when I came in mid-year, and [Belichick] was like, ‘It doesn’t matter who you are or what you’ve done. You earn your keep.’ ”More from Yahoo Sports: • Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight The Brady Conundrum: How do you go about replacing the GOAT? originally appeared on nbcsportsboston.comThe Patriots hatched a Tom Brady succession plan after the 2013 season when they drafted Jimmy Garoppolo.Brady blew that up.Now, five years, four Super Bowl appearances, three Super Bowl wins, two Super Bowl MVPs and a regular-season MVP later, it's time to gingerly -- caaaauuuuuutiooooousssssllllyyyyy -- begin the process again.This time should be different.Even though Brady's contract hasn't been extended past the 2019 season, the love and happiness we saw on the field after the Rams were dispatched in SB53 is a good sign.MORE PATRIOTSAreas of Change: Will Pats be able to retain free agents Trey Flowers and Trent Brown?Brady's wariness about the Patriots' plans for him, and Bill Belichick's wariness about wedding his team to a quarterback who's closer to 50 years old than he is to 30, has dissipated.Once a new deal is in place -- Jonathan Kraft indicated that might be before training camp, though as of the Super Bowl conversations hadn't started -- Brady will have a written assurance that he will leave the Patriots and the NFL on his terms.That wasn't the case in early 2014 when the soon-to-be-37-year-old Brady saw the Patriots spend a first-round pick on a defensive tackle (Dominique Easley) and their second-rounder on Garoppolo. That, after a '13 season Brady spent throwing to the likes of Aaron Dobson, Josh Boyce, Kenbrell Thompkins and Austin Collie.Garoppolo was a stick of dynamite under Brady's behind. He was the existential threat Brady feared made flesh.Jimmy might have thought he was drafted to learn how to play quarterback in the NFL and have a nice career. To Brady, Garoppolo was there to take his job, throw his career into upheaval, uproot his family and see Brady cast out into the NFL wilderness.MORE PATRIOTSPerry: If Beckham is on the trade block, should Patriots be willing to pay the price?And, in contrast to the guy Brady succeeded in 2001 (and, by extension, did all those things to), Brady wasn't going to snort derisively at the plucky little draft pick here to take his job. He would crush the threat.He did.Brady played so well that -- despite Garoppolo developing into a bona-fide front-line quarterback under Belichick and Josh McDaniels (and Brady) -- Brady left the ever-prepared Patriots with no recourse when Garoppolo's contract was about to expire.Brady was too good to bench and too important to trade. Garoppolo was too expensive to franchise and too smart to take a \"bridge\" contract so he could watch Brady from the sidelines while his own hair started to gray at the temples. So off he went around Halloween, 2017.A lot's happened in the 16 months since.MORE PATRIOTSPhil Perry's Mock Draft 1.0: Pats start looking for Gronk's replacementBut now here we are, in the offseason of Brady's 42nd year. And the complex question of how to find the player who will eventually replace the greatest quarterback in NFL history still lingers.Do you draft his successor? If you do, do you do it this year? Do you do it next year?Do you try to get into the top 10 to get your pick of the litter? Do you stay put, confident that the muttonheads across the league will miss out as they did with Brady and Garoppolo (or Aaron Rodgers, Russell Wilson, Drew Brees, Brett Favre, Johnny Unitas . . . you get the point)? How much will it cost to get into the top 10? Do you package picks from this season -- when you will have six in the first three rounds -- and pick a sucker who will suck next year and fleece them for their 2020 first-rounder? How high do you have to go for a blue-chip, given the number of first-round quarterbacks that will be taken this year and that were taken in 2018?Is it a trade for somebody another team's given up on or has no work for, like San Francisco's Nick Mullens? A veteran who will hit free agency like Nick Foles, Case Keenum or Teddy Bridgewater?How does the successor play the position? Similar to Brady in that brain/eyes/accuracy/commitment trumps legs/arm strength/versatility?MORE PATRIOTSShould Pats be interested in Demaryius Thomas? No . . . and yesOr is there an embrace of the fact that trying to find a quarterback similar to a guy who came into the league after four years at Michigan at the end of last century with a once-in-a-lifetime work ethic is a pipe dream?Aside from who the successor is and how he plays, can Brady -- the lion in winter -- be tapped to help groom whoever is being brought aboard to take over?Brady -- contrary to sexed-up speculation -- didn't actively undermine Garoppolo at any point. They were teammates. He helped Garoppolo play the position better. They became close. But he wasn't quite showing him his world, either. Brady is famous for saying he's not giving away his secrets to younger quarterbacks until after he's done.With the end-date likely to be agreed upon when he signs an extension, does he become more a mentor so that the success of the franchise has a better chance to continue after he leaves? Would the Patriots want him to do that?Or would they want a blank(ish) slate to work with that isn't saying, \"But Tom said . . . \" when they try to shape him to succeed?And that contract? What's it look like? Does Brady demand pay commensurate with what he's accomplished? Is he in the mood to do the team another financial solid given the only bump they have him in 2018 was incentives he never reached? How does that impact the structure of the team?These questions aren't new. What is new is the level of angst and anxiousness. It's dissipated tremendously.That won't make finding his replacement or choosing the means by which the Patriots will do it any easier. But it's less fraught now.The irony is, the Patriots already successfully found Brady's successor. It's just that 2014 was too soon to go looking for him.Now, can they do it again?Click here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!

      "        ©2019 Oath Inc. All Rights Reserved.    Yahoo Sports' Charles Robinson and Amanda Borges address the settlement between the players and the NFL, and what it means for their continuing efforts to promote social activism.The NBA jerseys of the future have a new feature to them: the ability to customize them after purchase by changing the name and number.In an awkward reveal reminiscent of a tech presentation, NBA commissioner Adam Silver and sportscaster Ahmad Rashad demonstrated the jersey at the NBA Tech Summit on Friday ahead of All-Star Weekend in Charlotte, switching a No. 30 Stephen Curry jersey to No. 23 Michael Jordan threads.Adam Silver just revealed the NBA jersey of the future that changes the name and number 🤯(via @NBA)pic.twitter.com/cgJk7KcIIU— Yahoo Sports (@YahooSports) February 15, 2019If Silver is trying to pull a Steve Jobs, perhaps he should stick to his day job. But in all seriousness, the jersey presents some interesting questions: Will it be easier for fans to “bandwagon”? Can players switch jerseys mid-game? Will Drake be first in line for this new prop?Meanwhile, Twitter had all of the jokes.Jersey cost only 20 easy installments of, $999.99.— Vod Kanockers (@JHoward2716) February 15, 2019Kevin Durant can now switch teams mid game with these new #NBA jerseys 😳 pic.twitter.com/a01rMkiexr— OT Sports Podcast Network (@OTSportsPod) February 15, 2019This could go one of two ways: Either the NBA will have found another way to separate itself from the other sports leagues or it will be a pointless feature that exists just because there is the technology to make it happen and for Twitter to crack jokes. In any case, you have to admit the NBA never fails to entertain.More from Yahoo Sports: • Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight When spring training camps opened this week around Major League Baseball, it brought hope that maybe, finally, Bryce Harper and Manny Machado would sign with teams and baseball’s long free-agent freeze would melt away.Nope. Not yet. Not only has that not happened, something else did happen: a number of talented young players around the league have agreed to team-friendly contract extensions.The latest was New York Yankees ace Luis Severino, who on Friday reportedly agreed to a four-year, $40 million deal. The deal, first reported by Joel Sherman of the New York Post, would buy up Severino’s arbitration years and comes with a $15 million club option for his first year of free agency.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]By agreeing to this deal, the Yankees and Severino avoid arbitration for 2019. He’ll make $4 million this season, $10 million next, then $10.25 million in 2021 and $11 million in 2022. The club option is for 2023. In the grand scheme of society, this is a very generous contract. In baseball’s economic bubble, it’s another young player signing for below-market value relative to his skills and potential.It’s hard to blame Severino for taking the deal, looking around at a free-agent world where Harper and Machado are still available, as are Dallas Keuchel and Craig Kimbrel. Especially since we haven’t heard even slight grumblings about teams being interested in Keuchel and Kimbrel.Coming off a breakout season in which he went 19-8 with a 3.39 ERA, the 25-year-old Severino was given a deal that’s pretty hard to turn down: “Do you want $40 million guaranteed, yes or no?”The other players faced with a similar question this week were Philadelphia Phillies ace Aaron Nola, who said yes to a four-year, $45 million deal Wednesday. It also avoided arbitration and bought out two of Nola’s free agency years, making it the most below-market deal of any of these.The Minnesota Twins locked up two of their talented young players Thursday, as right fielder Max Kepler agreed to a five-year, $35 million deal with a $10 million club option for 2024. It buys out three years of free agency for Kepler, 26. Shortstop Jorge Polanco also agreed to a five-year extension, his is worth $25.75 million with two option years that could keep him in Minnesota through 2025.In a vacuum, these types of extensions look like win-wins: The players get guaranteed money as they’re coming off good seasons. The clubs get cost-certainty to help them navigate the future — whether it’s the Yankees and Phillies trying to add big free agents this year or next, or a team like the Twins striving for contention with a homegrown core.In a bigger sense, though, it’s hard not to look at these deals in the current state of free agency and wonder if they’re a symptom of something else. Is it the market correcting itself? Is it baseball’s economy morphing into something new? Or maybe it’s just players looking around and saying, “Well, I better get my money now.”According to numerous reports, there’s a fear that for this generation of young players the light at the end of the tunnel — the big free-agency payday — won’t be there for them in the same way it was for so many other players.So while it’s great that stars like Justin Verlander, Clayton Kershaw and Max Scherzer are publicly speaking out about the current state of free agency, they’re on the right side of it. They got their mega deals.The younger players find themselves in a different sort of peril. It’s entirely possible that these are the biggest paydays these players ever get, which is a much different economic model that we’ve seen from baseball in the past.Whether it’s right or wrong — and that’s certainly something that’s up for debate heading into the next collective-bargaining agreement — baseball’s economy has often been backward. Players get paid less, relative to the market, in their pre-free agency years. The best recent example is Mike Trout winning the MVP in 2014 at age 22 while making $1 million.He got a raise to $6 million the next season, but in 2015 was still making a fraction of what people like Ryan Howard ($25M), Albert Pujols ($24M), Joe Mauer ($23M), Mark Teixeira ($22.5M) and Jose Reyes ($22M) were making.But that overpay is a necessary part baseball’s economic ecosystem too. It’s a fact: Players get overpaid as their careers decline. It’s almost like baseball’s way of making up for underpaying players during their early years. It’s baseball’s golden parachute. What’s happening these days is fewer teams are accepting that overpay as part of the how the system works.In the past few years, arbitration salaries have gotten higher and higher, and teams have tried harder to lock up younger stars before free agency. It’s why we’ve see players like Madison Bumgarner, Chris Archer, Chris Sale and Paul Goldschmidt become valuable trade chips for their team-friendly contract extensions.Teams are getting smarter about where their money goes, and how to keep value in their assets. These extensions to Severino, Nola and the rest show that they’re willing to spend money, just in the way that they want.Earlier this week, former Miami Marlins president David Samson tweeted something in response to Justin Verlander, saying the “broken system” talk was wrong. Players and their agents, Samson said, needed to adjust to a “new reality.”He may be right about the new reality part. The monster paydays at the end of the free agency tunnel could be fading away. If Bryce Harper and Manny Machado can’t get them, who can?The new reality could be players seizing their money. Whenever they can.– – – – – –Mike Oz is a writer at Yahoo Sports.

Follow @MikeOzMore from Yahoo Sports:• Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlightSt. Louis Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright became the latest player to forecast a “doom and gloom” outlook for Major League Baseball based on the growing financial and philosophical disconnect between the players and the owners.The sentiment that a strike will happen is one we’ve become accustomed to hearing from the players. However, Wainwright framed the situation with a little more urgency on Friday by expressing concerns that a day of reckoning could happen sooner than later.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]Speaking to InsideSTL.com’s Tim McKernan, Wainwright said it was inevitable that the players will go on strike unless major changes are made to help bridge the widening gap. But he’s also worried that frustrations could reach a boiling point during the season leading to some form of a revolt. Perhaps even a mid-season walkout.#STLCards pitcher Adam Wainwright on @TMASTL: “Unless something changes, there’s going to be a strike. 100%. I’m just worried people are going to walk-out mid-season.” pic.twitter.com/M8WeRVcASe— Tim McKernan (@tmckernan) February 15, 2019“Unless something changes, there’s going to be a strike. 100%,” Wainwright said regarding the free-agent freeze that has left stars like Bryce Harper and Manny Machado without contracts. “I’m just worried people are going to walkout midseason.”It’s conceivable given the current climate, but a players revolt on that level still feels like a long shot. The target date we should all still be looking at is Dec. 1, 2021. That’s when the current collective bargaining agreement ends and the owners will be forced to come to the table.That doesn’t mean we should just dismiss Wainwright’s concerns about a 2019 strike. While they might feel a little on the dramatic side, the frustration that has built all offseason as dozens of free agents, including and especially Harper and Machado, remain unsigned is becoming more palpable by the day. There’s a genuine feeling that owners are determined to cut back on salaries even as profits continue to reach new heights, it’s possible the players’ patience will run out if the free-agent freeze continues to drag on. Wainwright thinks so, and he’s far from alone.In Friday’s interview, the 37-year-old right-hander also criticized owners and front offense personnel for placing too much emphasis on “analytics” and placing everything in a “sabermetric box” that discounts intangibles and other immeasurable aspects of baseball.Adam Wainwright said today on ⁦@TMASTL⁩ that he expects there to be a strike “100%.”The context of the conversation comes from a discussion on how Bryce Harper and Manny Machado are still without teams.You can see Wainwright’s reasoning in the video below. pic.twitter.com/GXsmx4cXk1— Tim McKernan (@tmckernan) February 15, 2019Wainwright admitted that there’s always risk in making long-term financial commitments to players, but emphasized that doing so marks a commitment to winning that several teams seemingly lack.“Part of it is smart from their side of it, but you have to realize it’s about winning. So, if Bryce Harper wants 10 years and he’s 26 years old. He’s going to be a dynamic player. The same can be said about Manny Machado. These guys are superstar players.”The deeper we get into it the more obvious it is that the players know what battles lie ahead. The only real question is how much worse it will get before any progress is made toward a satisfactory resolution.More from Yahoo Sports:• Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight MLB rumors: Bryce Harper has made his decision, says D.C. radio host originally appeared on nbcsportsbayarea.comA report has come out from the East Coast saying Bryce Harper has come to a decision on which team he will play for in 2019 and beyond.Chris Russell, a sports radio talk show host from 106.7 The Fan in Washington D.C., (who has been on the Harper beat for some time) said the free agent slugger could make a decision in the next 24 hours.\"Maybe I took a little bit of a leap of faith here based on some indications I got from a real good source,\" Russell told 94WIP, in Philadelphia, on Friday.\"Bryce and his representatives, (Scott) Boras, his people, his wife Kayla, they've been meeting since Monday morning in Vegas. Bryce originally wanted this done, when it took this long, by Valentine's Day. Obviously, the contract has not been announced, signed, or whatever.\"\"But I'm led to believe by the people that I've talked to that are close to the situation -- and I have, again, a real good source that has helped me through this process, let's just leave it at that,\" Russell said. \"That Bryce was in a mood to celebrate yesterday. Now, the source said, 'I believe it's done.' I don't have concrete, 100 percent proof for you guys. I wish I did, otherwise, I would have it and I would be running around with it. But I don't have that, so I want to caution everybody in Philadelphia. But that's what I was led to believe, that this thing is now decided.\"Russell then mentioned the Phillies.\"Now, what comes then is hammering out a contract. And if we were to believe the report that the Philadelphia Phillies had not even extended a formal offer -- and I assume that to be a termed, written agreement, that type of thing, which I find hard to believe -- then there might be more legwork to this. And therefore, hey the decision may be done, but the contract still needs to be ironed out.\"[RELATED: Phillies fan participates in \"lent\" in hopes of recruiting Harper]Russell is being safe with the terminology he's using, which is understandable. And while we haven't been able to confirm these rumors, Harper, along with many other free agents, remains unsigned.The Giants appeared to be the \"mystery team\" that introduced themselves late into the Harper sweepstakes -- and when the radio hosts asked Russell his opinion on where the outfielder will end up next season, he believed Harper will be in an orange and black uniform.\"I don't think it's going to be the Nationals,\" Russell said. \"I think it's going to be the San Francisco Giants, but that is not by any means an 'I know that for a fact,' so I want to caution everybody -- I know how this works -- I get in trouble with everything I say on my radio show, and everyone blows it up.\" The wait continues ... Golden State Warriors stars Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant empathised with Steve Kerr after the head coach was ejected during the loss to the Portland Trail Blazers having thrown a clipboard in response to a flagrant foul call.Kerr was enraged late in the fourth quarter when Draymond Green was called for a flagrant foul after he stopped Zach Collins from approaching the rim as he went up for a shot.That drew Kerr's ire and after ranting in one referee's face, he slammed a clipboard down to earn an ejection, with Durant having to escort his head coach back off the court.The Warriors lost the game 129-107 but will still head into the All-Star break with the best record in the Western Conference.\"It was an emotional game. We fought really hard for 43 minutes,\" Curry told reporters afterwards.\"One questionable decision - the flagrant - obviously the fire came out. You see coach go and throw a clipboard. At that point you try to get us over the hump. An eight-point swing, it's tough to overcome.\"\"I looked at the replay and the amount of ball [Green] got, there was nothing excessive about it, he got all the ball.\"There was a lot of chirping, with Zach involved. There was probably a sensitivity to it, trying to put out some fires, but I thought it was a terrible call. We obviously paid the price for it with how everything unfolded after that.\"Durant shared that sympathy having been the one to pull Kerr away from the referees as he continued to rant at them.\"I felt for him, I understand his anger and his rage, especially for that call,\" he said.\"I thought we should have just kept playing, It was a common foul, I thought. Refs looked at it differently. \"I understand why coach was a little frustrated.\"Kerr explained that it was the disbelief at the call that had triggered his reaction.\"I was just shocked that that was called a flagrant foul,\" he said. \"I'm not sure how it's determined - if it's in New York or the officials on the call - but that was head-scratching: that that could be called a flagrant foul.\"The guy's going to go in for a dunk, you've got to make sure he doesn't dunk it.\"So, I told Kenny [Mauer] that I beg to differ. There might have been a couple of other words in there too!\"I'll have to ask the owner if the clipboard broke when I threw it down. I got a little anger out so that was good. I was too busy yelling to ask for an explanation.\"Charles Barkley thinks New Orleans Pelicans star Anthony Davis made a mistake with his trade request.The 25-year-old asked the Pelicans to move him in late January and the Los Angeles Lakers had been engaged in discussions about acquiring him. But, no deal was reached before the deadline and Davis remained with New Orleans.Barkley, an 11-time All-Star who works as an analyst for TNT, said he thinks Davis and his agent, Rich Paul, mishandled the situation.\"Don't ruin your reputation as a great player, one of the nicest guys in the world,\" Barkley told reporters on Thursday ahead of All-Star weekend (via the Washington Post).\"Remember, your agent works for you, you don't work for him. They handled that situation wrong. It's going to come back to bite them in the a***. It's unfortunate.\"The six-time All-Star entered play on Thursday averaging 28.5 points and 13.1 rebounds this season. But, he scored just three points in 24 minutes on the floor in the Pelicans' 118-88 loss to the Orlando Magic earlier this week.\"This is a bad situation,\" Barkley said. \"It's a bad look for the NBA. Because that kid can't go out there and give 100 per cent because he’s worried about getting hurt. The guy's the second-best player in the world and he's got three points? That's not a good look for the NBA.\"The Boston Celtics and New York Knicks, among others, are expected to explore dealing for Davis after the season. Barkley, however, said he believes the forward will eventually land in Los Angeles because of Paul's relationship with Lakers star LeBron James.Barkley tallied 22.1 points and 11.7 rebounds per game over his 16-year career. He retired in 2000 and was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame six years later.After an apology from Sergio Garcia, a non-apology from Matt Kuchar, and an uncooperative Mother Nature on Valentine's Day, it's time for everyone to focus again on Tiger Woods. Kidding. Sort of. A weather-delayed first round at Riviera re-starts on Friday morning and the 14-time major champ will be in the Hollywood-area spotlight as he finally begins his Genesis Open. And golf fans could potentially see a LOT of the tournament host as the event tries to play catch up after heavy rains on Thursday.Woods, Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas (Decent group, eh?) are scheduled to tee off at 8:32 local time (11:32 ET). The hope is they will complete their first rounds and then play as much of their second rounds as possible before darkness. And Tiger's hope is to finally win for the first time at this historic layout where he missed the cut last year. We'll be tracking Tiger every step of the way so keep it right here for the latest scores, news and highlights. (All times eastern)SATURDAY, 11:25: With a 25-foot birdie putt on No. 9, Woods' final hole of the second round, Tiger will likely make the cut. The birdie brought Woods back to even on his round and to one under overall.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096808527694245890After resuming play in the morning, Woods bogeyed his first hole, No. 4, then made four pars before his finishing birdie. His playing partners, however, fared much better. Justin Thomas shares the lead with Adam Scott at 11 under and Rory McIlroy birdied four of his six holes on Saturday morning to shoot 63 and move to seven under through 36 holes. Thursday's early wave is now on the course for their second rounds.-------------------FRIDAY-------------------8:25: And with that, the horn has sounded—play will be suspended for darkness on Friday at Riviera. Tiger, JT and Rory have six more holes to complete their second round. Justin Thomas is at 10-under, tied with Adam Scott for the lead. Tiger will hope Saturday brings some different momentum for him—as this marathon day ends with two bogeys in a row after the highlight eagle.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10965708926692065298:21: That's back-to-back bogeys now for Tiger Woods, dropping another shot here at the third hole (his 12th of the round). And over his past six holes, Tiger has four bogeys. The birdie at No. 1 helped negate most of that damage ... but Tiger's back to 1-under again—right on the current cut line.8:13: On his 30th hole of the day, Tiger is showing some obvious signs of being tired. And who could blame him—he's been playing golf for nearly 10 hours straight. From 165 yards out at the third hole, Tiger Woods tries to chop out a 6-iron and comes out of it. His ball comes to rest short of the green. With sunset in Pacific Palisades being 5:30 local time, this group will have time for maybe one more hole today.8:04: Tiger follows up that eagle putt at No. 1 with a bogey at the second hole. The third bogey of his second round moves Tiger back to 2-under overall.7:56: After a long wait at the second hole, Tiger sprays his second shot from 235 out with a fairway wood out to the right. He'll have his work cut out from the front right bunker to save par at the 482-yard par 4.7:40: This is exactly what Tiger Woods needed: He rolls in his 43-foot eagle putt at his 10th hole (the first) to get back to 3-under—negating those two bogeys he made on his front nine. What a putt! With the flagstick in!https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096570892669206529Tiger made a disappointing par to open his first round earlier today at the first hole. The unlikely eagle makes up for that effort—and could turn around Tiger's second round in a dramatic way. Tiger goes from toeing the cut line at 1-under to now all of a sudden being T-21.7:28: Tiger finds the fairway at the par-5 first hole, the group's 10th hole of their second round, as he attempts to get a shot back here after bogeying two of his final three holes on his front nine. Neither bogey was particularly bad—the 18th hole is playing brutally tough right now uphill and into the wind with the rain, making it even more of a challenging hole. And his break at 16 was very unlucky.7:16: Tiger and JT are gonna have their work cut out to save par at the 18th hole (their ninth). Each player had fairway wood approaches and tried playing a big cut. JT was way up left on the hill—Tiger was closer. He went high with his approach and will have about 11 feet left for par.Tiger misses the par putt, so he'll drop a shot along with JT as they make the turn. Tiger moves back to 1-under after 27 holes. That's where the cut line currently is—so all of a sudden, Tiger must be concerned about making the cut.7:01: Following Justin Thomas throwing a dart at the 17th to about 3 feet, Tiger puts his wedge shot from under 100 yards to outside 20 feet, so he'll be disappointed with that effort. The birdie putt misses on the high side, and Tiger taps in for par to remain at 2-under. His playing partner and buddy Justin Thomas stays hot, rolling in a fourth straight birdie to get to 9-under—tied for the lead with Adam Scott. Really impressive golf here from JT.6:54: The rain is really coming down now as the players head to the 17th hole. Tiger finds the fairway at the par-5 17th hole, but it was a short one—he has 326 yards left. Most players have been laying up at this par 5 all day.6:43: From a brutal position up against the back lip of the bunker, Tiger hacks it out—and somehow keeps the ball on the green, albeit the back portion. His par attempt from 44 feet away here comes up three feet shy. Tiger makes his bogey to move back to 2-under.Meanwhile, Justin Thomas is officially on fire. He has another birdie after a fabulous tee shot at 16. It's now two Kentucky boys tied at the top: Justin Thomas and J.B. Holmes (-8).https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10965576791939317766:39: Tiger will have serious lie issues at the par-3 16th hole. His tee shot came to rest up against the back lip of the bunker. As Billy Kratzert just remarked on PGA Tour Live, Tiger will do well just to keep this ball on the green. Though he avoided dropping a shot on his last hole, there might be a bogey in his future here.6:35: A clutchhh par save by Tiger at the 15th hole makes up for his poor chip—and Tiger keeps the momentum going on his second round, as he stays 3-under for the tournament and 2-under on the round.Justin Thomas, also in Tiger's group, holed out from in front of the green for birdie at the 14th hole, and he makes a long birdie putt at 15 to get to 7-under—just one back of fellow Kentucky native J.B. Holmes.6:32: A poor chip shot from Tiger at the 15th hole leaves him about 13 feet away. He'll need to convert that putt to prevent dropping his first shot of his second round.6:24: Tiger finds another fairway here at Riviera, this one at the 15th hole. The guy is feeeling it with his driver. Almost on auto pilot. His approach from 190 out turns a little too much, finding the rough to the left of the green. He'll have to get up and down to avoid dropping one here.6:20: From 20 feet out, Tiger's birdie bid comes up shy—never really scaring the hole, despite getting a good look at the line from Rory's putt. Tiger taps in for par to remain at 3-under.The putter has been disappointing for Tiger all day: He had 34 putts in his first round, including four three-putts, just the third time in his career he's done that.6:13: Tiger puts his tee shot at the par-3 14th hole just inside Rory's ball—about 20 feet right of the hole. He'll get a little teach from Rory's putt, too, as Tiger continues to hit it well today.6:07: Tiger just misses the left-to-right curling bid for birdie, leaving himself with an easy par at 13. He stays 3-under for the tournament and -2 through four on his round.Tiger's playing partners are also playing well—Rory has three birdies in his first four holes to get to 2-under. Look out for Rory at rainy Riviera. And Justin Thomas, despite hitting his tee shot out of bounds at 13, got up and down from 160 yards to avoid dropping multiple shots. He's now 5-under after that bogey.6:02: Another grooved tee shot for Tiger Woods at the 13th hole puts him in good position. He turned over his tee shot—putting his draw in the middle of the fairway at the dogleg left. Tiger spins his approach back to about 15 feet, just off the green in the fringe. He'll have a chance to knock another one here and keep the momentum going.5:51: Bang! Tiger nails the 25-footer for birdie at the 12th hole to add a second birdie to his card through three holes. Realistically, too, it could be three straight birdies for Tiger. But the 14-time major champion is now 2-under through 3—T-3 for the tournament (T-19)—and carries some strong momentum on his side at the start of his second round ... as the rain is coming down at Riviera.5:46: Tiger hits his approach hole high—about 25 feet from 181 yards. He'll have another chance to add a birdie to his third round.Tiger's currently at 2-under, which puts him at T-29. The projected cut is at 1-under—so he's comfortably inside the number as of now. But there's a ton of golf to be played, obviously.5:41: Tiger finds the fairway with his driver at the par-4 12th hole. The 12th usually plays as one of the toughest holes at Riviera—we'll see if Tiger can take advantage of his position here in the fairway.5:33: An excellent fairway-wood second shot by Tiger put him right in front of the par-5 11th green in two. But a very poor approach putt for his third leaves him more than 10 feet away. His birdie try slides by for a very disappointing par being so close in 2. That should've been a golden opportunity to start his second round with two birdies—instead, Tiger stays at 2-under.5:12: Tiger goes high with his pitch—having to navigate around the front bunker, and plays it nicely—spinning it about 7 feet short of the hole. So Tiger will have a good look for an opening birdie to start his second round. Tiger converts the birdie putt to move to 2-under.5:02: Only a little more than a half hour after finishing his first round, Tiger Woods (-1) -- along with Justin Thomas (-5) and Rory McIlroy (+1) -- has teed off in his second round. The group started on the drivable 10th hole, and Tiger has driven his tee shot just off the green. He'll have a chance to put his pitch shot close to start his second round with a birdie.4:24: Tiger narrowly misses the birdie putt at the 18th hole, so he'll tap in for a par and an opening-round, one-under 70 at Riviera. Having three-putted for a fourth time on the 17th hole to drop a shot in disappointing fashion, Tiger will head to his second round a bit frustrated. But the four consecutive birdies showed him being able to score well at Riviera, where he has never won.Tiger, JT (who birdied 18 to finish at 5-under) and Rory will head right back for their second round in this marathon day for them.4:18: Tiger responds to that shocking three-putt with a perfect drive and a towering 6-iron on Riviera's famed 18th. Woods is in good shape to at least make par the difficult hole, but as we've seen all day, a two-putt is anything but automatic.Here's an unusual stat on Tiger three-putting four times this afternoon. He's making some history in a bad way...https://twitter.com/JustinRayGolf/status/10965196250582507574:06: So much for the momentum. . . After a decent approach shot that spins back to about 20 feet, Woods runs his birdie putt a couple feet by and. . . gulp. . . misses the comebacker from about two feet. Wow. That's four three-putts on the day as Tiger falls back to one under with one hole to play.3:57: Uh-oh, it's raining in southern California again. Meanwhile, Woods is plodding his way up the par-5 17th. After pulling his drive into the left rough and drawing a poor lie, Woods pushed his layup slightly into the first cut of the right rough. He'll have a some sort of wedge to a back-right hole location.3:50: Tiger's tee shot was tracking on the par-3 16th, but it comes up about 30 feet short. From there, he two-putts for par to remain at two under. Justin Thomas makes his 10-foot birdie effort to move to four under, while Rory McIlroy remains at one over. McIlroy hast two holes to avert his first over-par score of 2019.3:40: After another great drive and a solid approach, Woods races his birdie attempt nearly five feet past the hole. But he keeps the overall positive momentum going by converting the par putt to remain at two under. Tiger has three more holes to play. At least, before he gets a lunch break.3:24: BANG! There's the bounce back from Tiger. It just came one hole later. And from farther away as Woods drains his 12-footer for birdie on No. 14.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096507996031467520Woods is now back to two under, five shots behind Jordan Spieth, who has to be pleased to still be in front by two despite these soft conditions.3:17: Tiger hits a great shot on the difficult par-3 14th hole to about 15 feet. He'll have a good look at birdie coming up. In the meantime, here's a look at how the leader board stands with Jordan Spieth still leading the way.Jordan Spieth (-7) 2t. Tony Finau (-5) 2t. Patrick Rodgers (-5) 2t. Kramer Hickok (-5) 2t. Davis Love III (-5) 2t. Adam Scott (-5) 2t. J.B. Homes (-5)Click here for full scores.3:13: Woods stuck his approach to about four feet below the hole on No. 13. A bounce back birdie looked like a forgone conclusion until he pushed his effort. Woof. That's two three-putts and two short misses on the greens for Tiger today. He remains at one under. Meanwhile, Rory McIlroy, after getting to two under through eight, has fallen to one over after back-to-back bogeys. Justin Thomas, the third player in the group, continues to lead this trio at three under.3:05: After hitting fade after fade, Woods steps to the 13th tee and rips a draw around the corner, perfectly setting up his next shot. Good to see him working it both ways with ease.3:01: Tiger pushed his tee shot into the right rough, then hit a fantastic recovery shot from a thick lie onto the green. He had a long look at birdie that rolled about four feet past, leaving him with a tricky left-to-right par putt, which he missed. That's three three putts on the day for Woods, and he's still one under.2:39: Not the best chip from Woods, as he left himself about six feet for birdie, but he makes it anyway. Four straight for Tiger to get to two under for the day.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10964952191957975042:30: Woods rips a 3-wood from 269 to just in front of the green. Hate to jinx him, but there's no reason he shouldn't easily make his fourth straight birdie here (ducks).2:20: Three in a row for Woods as he rolls in another at No. 10 and moves to one under. If he finds the fairway again at the 11th, four in a row will be in his sights. Meanwhile, Rory makes his par to stay at one under and JT ends up holing his 10 footer for birdie to get to four under. Finally a little bit of JUICE from this threesome.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096489287753711616https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096489787672780800By the way, it looks like we know when they'll be heading back out for round two later today. Here's an update from the Tiger Tracker:https://twitter.com/GCTigerTracker/status/1096481806067523585That should give them enough time to get at least 11 or 12 holes in.At the 11th, Woods stripes another drive down the fairway. He's really starting to cook.2:12: Tiger's shot was a tad more difficult than we thought, as he had to avoid a bunker and take it up high to get it back to the pin. He was successful, sticking it to about three feet. Hell of a shot. Even better was Rory's shot, as he flopped it from a nice lie and got it to hang on just off the back of the green and stay out of the back bunker. Thomas, who had the easiest shot, put too much spin on his chip, leaving himself with about 10 feet for birdie.2:07: Finally, Tiger, Rory and JT hit their tee shots, and it looks like the ensuing entertainment will be well worth the wait. Tiger is in the collection area left of the green, where he has a straightforward chip that should set him up with a good chance to make birdie. Thomas is just in front of the green, and he'll have a great chance to make a birdie as well. Rory ... um ... not so much. He's in the rough with a greenside bunker in front of him and a pin he won't be able to get close to, and just holding the green would be a miracle.1:52: Woods drains his four-footer for bird and turns in even par 35. Real strong finish to his opening nine, and now it looks like he'll have a long wait at the 10th. DeChambeau, Kuchar and Rahm have still yet to hit their tee shots.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10964831254067896321:47: Tiger had just 122 left to the green and stuck one in there close. He has four feet left for birdie to turn in even par, which would be a small victory after that ugly three putt back at No. 7. Not to mention he'll have a prime opportunity to get into red figures at the driveable par-4 10th.1:41: Woods cranks another high fade right down the middle with the driver at No. 9. With the tees up today, he'll have a low iron in his hand for his approach.1:34: And he's on the board! Woods bounces back with a birdie putt from 15 feet, getting him back to one over. We'll see if that gets him going before making the turn.1:30: From 125 yards out, Woods hit a wedge and hated it from the second he made contact. While he did pull it, he's still hole high and inside 20 feet. Hideki Matsuyama-esque move from Tiger.1:24: Woods rips one right down the middle at the par-4 eighth. Should have a short iron in.1:15: Tiger's birdie putt was actually from just off the green on the fringe, and he rolled it by some four feet. Then, he missed the comebacker for par, dropping to two over on the day. Oof.1:09: Fairway and a green for Woods at the seventh. Good look at birdie coming up to get back to level par.12:58: Another hole, another par for Woods, who two-putted from 24 feet on the par-3 sixth. In the group up ahead, though, Jon Rahm is making a move at three under through six.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/109646557828021452912:47: Another meh hole for Tiger on No. 5, just missing the fairway with his tee shot, finding the front of the green with a so-so approach, and two-putting for another par from 43 feet. Woods remains at one over through five holes while his playing partners, McIlroy and Thomas, both remain at one under.12:42: As Matt Kuchar's ball is in the air on the par-3 sixth, a fan yells, \"Go low—just not with the gratuity!\" Despite Matt maintaining this is \"not a story,\" it is. And this won't be the last comment like this.12:29: Woods hit a nice shot to about 15 feet on the par-3 fourth, but ran his birdie effort by the hole. Still one over. Still no highlights. At least, from Tiger. Here was Spieth's closing birdie from about an hour ago, because there is not much else exciting going on right now.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/109644546143346688112:17: Another missed fairway and another short approach from Tiger on the par-4 third. Although, Woods found the putting surface, he was unable to two-putt from 63 feet, missing a seven-footer for par after badly misreading his first putt. That drops Tiger to one over through three holes. Not a lot of highlights so far. . .12:02: Tiger misses right off the tee on No. 2 then comes up short on another approach. But his pitch shot nearly goes down, leaving him with a tap-in par. Even par through two holes.11:49: After that perfect opening tee shot, Tiger hit a hideous approach with a 5-iron that came up way short in a fairway bunker. From there, he hit his third to 10 feet but missed the putt to walk away with a disappointing par. Both of Tiger's playing partners, McIlroy and Thomas, make birdie.11:38: Matt Kuchar just misses his eagle attempt from 25 feet on No. 1, but taps in for birdie. Kuchar has been in the news a lot this week over a caddie controversy dating back to his win at the Mayakoba Golf Classic. A controversy he didn't help with his comments on Wednesday. Is it possible some of those \"Kuuuuch\" shouts will turn to \"Mooooch\"? Kinda sounded like it on the first hole. . .11:34: Jordan Spieth is in with a seven-under-par 64 to take the early lead. Spieth needed only 21 putts during his bogey-free round. Of course, starting tournaments hasn't been a problem for Spieth of late. Finishing, however, has been a different story. Incredibly, Spieth is looking for his first win since the 2017 British Open and his first top 5 since last year's Masters.11:32: Woods smashes a driver off the first tee that finds the fairway. The opening par 5 at Riviera is essentially a long par 4 and one of the easiest holes on the PGA Tour all year so Tiger is thinking at least birdie after that tee shot.10:53: So far, so good on the Friday weather:https://twitter.com/GCTigerTracker/status/1096437235262533632And with lift, clean and place in play (for at least the first round), low scores are out there. Let's set the over/under on the Par-71 layout at 68.5.10:45: We are approximately 45 minutes away from Tiger's tee time and it's another major champ who is already off to a fantastic start. Jordan Spieth has the lead at six under through 15 holes. Spieth leads Patrick Rodgers by one and then there's a big group at four under, including Bill Haas, who is playing in the event a year after being involved in a car accident during last year's tournament that killed a friend he was staying with. Make sure you read Brian Wacker's piece from earlier in the week on how Haas is still trying to move on from that tragedy.10:35: As we move within an hour from Tiger teeing off, check out GOLFTV's latest behind-the-scenes video with Woods in which he says his bag has up to 16(!) golf gloves during rainy rounds and he explains why he doesn't like wearing rain jackets:https://twitter.com/GOLFTV/status/1096246456795697153\"Pops used to say, 'Once you're wet, you're wet.

Johnson’s praise of Giannis Antetokounmpo drew yet another tampering fine.So, though he escaped punishment for his recent comments on 76ers guard Ben Simmons, Johnson refused to answer a question about Hornets guard Kemba Walker.Carolina Blitz:Asked Magic about Kemba and he said y’all aren’t going to catch him slipping anymore. pic.twitter.com/sQZtIWnQbn— Carolina Blitz (@KeepBlitzin) February 15, 2019Johnson:You know I can’t answer any questions about no players, because every time I do it, I get fined. But anybody else do it, they don’t get fined. So I’m going to stay away from that one.I don’t blame Johnson for feeling that way.Other teams’ owners, coaches and executives have repeatedly publicly discussed rival players without facing announced punishment.To be fair, the NBA doesn’t reveal every fine. Bucks owner Marc Lasry reportedly just got fined for tampering, but the league never announced it. But, at minimum, there’s an inconsistency with how the NBA exposes Johnson’s transgressions.Even NBA commissioner Adam Silver said last year there’s a spotlight on the Lakers due to prior tampering. That strikes me as unfair. The Lakers already paid for their prior violations and should now be held to the same standard as everyone else.And for what it’s worth, I wish that standard allowed an all-time great point guard like Johnson to publicly share his thoughts on Kemba Walker.Gareth Bale has landed himself in hot water after La Liga denounced the Real Madrid star for his celebration in the Madrid derby, which could carry a ban of four to 12 games.The Welsh forward scored as a substitute in the 3-1 victory over Atletico Madrid, bringing up his 100th goal for the club.And during the celebrations that followed, Bale \"lifted his right arm near his head in a clear sign of provocation towards the fans, then giving a gesture which could be seen as obscene and disdainful by folding his arm and striking it with his other hand.\"In a statement released by La Liga, Bale’s punishment will be decided by whether he incited the crowd or not.If Bale is guilty of “inciting opposition fans” to cause a hostile reaction, the punishment could carry four to 12 games, if there was no hostile reaction but intent, then it could be as little as one to three games.The gesture is referred to in Spain as ‘corte de mangas,’ with the moment not picked up in the referee’s match report.A committee will now decide whether the gesture merits a punishment.Bale also featured in Real’s Champions League victory over Ajax.Los Blancos take a 2-1 lead back to the Bernabeu for the second leg of the last 16 tie after Marco Asensio’s late winner.Earlier this week Heisman Trophy winner — and first round draft pick of the Oakland Athletics — Kyler Murray chose football over baseball, committing himself to the NFL draft.

In the last month alone he's won his 44th PGA Tour event, finished second in another, hit every fairway in a round for the first time in 21 years, shot a 60, pulled off this impossible recovery shot, gone viral just by rolling his eyes and said he might drop the Players from his schedule because he's already won it (a literal mic drop). The man simply cannot be stopped right now.Leave it to the weather to literally rain on Lefty's parade. On Thursday at the Genesis Open, Mickelson began his first round at the difficult short par-4 10th and drove into one of the bunkers up near the green, leaving him with a dreaded lengthy sand shot. He wound up hitting it over the green, and his ball plugged in the back bunker, setting up an even harder shot than he just had. As you'll hear PGA Tour Live commentator Shane Bacon say, avoiding making a six was probably the goal, but after Mickelson hit his third into another bunker on the other side of the green, a six suddenly became best-case scenario. How does a four sound instead?https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096076528142626818Find us a more Phil Mickelson par ever... you can't. He's always got a flair for the dramatic. The problem?

(Old man golfers)The dust is barely settled in the wake of the end of the Markelle Fultz era in Philadelphia, and the former 76ers guard is already taking shots at his old team.His old coach Brett Brown in particular.Fultz had his introductory press conference with the Orlando Magic on Thursday after being traded at last week’s deadline and praised his new coach Steve Clifford while taking a veiled shot at Brown.“It just excites me to know that I have a coach that’s going to push you to be better and not just going to tell you what you want to hear,” Fultz said.That’s direct praise for his new coach. But the message for Brown is clear. Fultz didn’t like what he heard from the Philadelphia coaching staff.Fultz never had any public dispute with the 76ers, but it was evident that he and the team had different approaches to the struggles that saw him shoot 41.4 percent from the field, 26.7 percent from 3-point distance and 53.4 percent from the line in limited action after being selected as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2017 draft.It’s still not clear whether injury or a mental block – or both – are the cause of his shooting issues.After his agent announced that the nerve disorder thoracic outlet syndrome was the root of the shooting woes, Fultz never played again for the 76ers.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]Fultz appears to be fully embracing the fresh start in Orlando as a player and a person.“I think the biggest thing we talked about what doing thing the right way,” Fultz said. “Just building me up both as a man and on the court. I think that’s music to my ears, really just. Two things I really want to do is be the best player I can be and be the best young man I can be.”Fultz described the experience of his nerve disorder to reporters.“It’s hard to lift up your arms, you lose feeling in your fingers,” Fultz said. “You can’t tell when it’s going to happen. It’s not like you do the same motion every time. You get tingling in your fingers, numbness. Stuff like that.”He also curtly dismissed any notion that his shooting struggles are due to anything but injury.“I had an injury,” Fultz said. “I was out there trying to play through that. I never lost confidence.”Asked about a timetable to return, Fultz dodged the question to talk about rehab.“Right now it’s just about getting everything the right way,” he said. “Rehab’s been going great. I’m just taking my time and doing everything the right way.”More from Yahoo Sports: • PGA Tour pro defends paying caddie $5K on $1.3M win • NFL bars NCAA’s all-time sack leader from combine • Only one NBA team failed to scout Antetokounmpo • Black History honor for Kaepernick sacked by lawmakers He might not be well known to NFL fans at large, but New England Patriots fans know linebacker Kyle Van Noy — acquired basically for free from the Detroit Lions at the 2016 trade deadline — has been a big part of the defense the last two years, and has a knack for making plays at the right time.Van Noy is getting a little shine after winning his second Super Bowl ring with New England, appearing on the “Pardon My Take” podcast on Thursday to dish on all things Patriots and Super Bowl LIII.One thing that Van Noy revealed: the Los Angeles Rams didn’t do anything surprising during the game on offense.“I couldn’t believe that,” Van Noy said. “They really didn’t do — not one wrinkle. I was like, ‘What the hell?’ They’ve got so many good players, they’ve got so many things they’ve done all year, and the one play they gave us which was a wrinkle was the [Brandin] Cooks screen that hit for a little bit.“And that was it… Or maybe too, we were playing so good they were like, ‘[Expletive], we don’t know what to do.’ ”Hindsight, of course, is 20-20, but given that the Patriots’ coaching staff is known for having its players prepared for any and everything, it seems unwise that Los Angeles didn’t add some new plays or looks to try to stump New England.Van Noy said the Patriots’ culture, specifically coach Bill Belichick’s practice of not sparing anyone in the film room, even Tom Brady, is part of why the team continues to win.“Oh yeah. Yeah, that [stuff is] sick, to be honest, because it sets the table,” Van Noy said. “Like, OK, it doesn’t matter who you are, everyone’s on an even playing field. This is how it is here at work. You come in and you earn everything.“And I respect that because I felt like that gave me a chance to get on the field when I came in mid-year, and [Belichick] was like, ‘It doesn’t matter who you are or what you’ve done. You earn your keep.’ ”More from Yahoo Sports: • Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight The Brady Conundrum: How do you go about replacing the GOAT? originally appeared on nbcsportsboston.comThe Patriots hatched a Tom Brady succession plan after the 2013 season when they drafted Jimmy Garoppolo.Brady blew that up.Now, five years, four Super Bowl appearances, three Super Bowl wins, two Super Bowl MVPs and a regular-season MVP later, it's time to gingerly -- caaaauuuuuutiooooousssssllllyyyyy -- begin the process again.This time should be different.Even though Brady's contract hasn't been extended past the 2019 season, the love and happiness we saw on the field after the Rams were dispatched in SB53 is a good sign.MORE PATRIOTSAreas of Change: Will Pats be able to retain free agents Trey Flowers and Trent Brown?Brady's wariness about the Patriots' plans for him, and Bill Belichick's wariness about wedding his team to a quarterback who's closer to 50 years old than he is to 30, has dissipated.Once a new deal is in place -- Jonathan Kraft indicated that might be before training camp, though as of the Super Bowl conversations hadn't started -- Brady will have a written assurance that he will leave the Patriots and the NFL on his terms.That wasn't the case in early 2014 when the soon-to-be-37-year-old Brady saw the Patriots spend a first-round pick on a defensive tackle (Dominique Easley) and their second-rounder on Garoppolo. That, after a '13 season Brady spent throwing to the likes of Aaron Dobson, Josh Boyce, Kenbrell Thompkins and Austin Collie.Garoppolo was a stick of dynamite under Brady's behind. He was the existential threat Brady feared made flesh.Jimmy might have thought he was drafted to learn how to play quarterback in the NFL and have a nice career.

He would crush the threat.He did.Brady played so well that -- despite Garoppolo developing into a bona-fide front-line quarterback under Belichick and Josh McDaniels (and Brady) -- Brady left the ever-prepared Patriots with no recourse when Garoppolo's contract was about to expire.Brady was too good to bench and too important to trade. Garoppolo was too expensive to franchise and too smart to take a \"bridge\" contract so he could watch Brady from the sidelines while his own hair started to gray at the temples.

Do you stay put, confident that the muttonheads across the league will miss out as they did with Brady and Garoppolo (or Aaron Rodgers, Russell Wilson, Drew Brees, Brett Favre, Johnny Unitas . . . you get the point)? How much will it cost to get into the top 10? Do you package picks from this season -- when you will have six in the first three rounds -- and pick a sucker who will suck next year and fleece them for their 2020 first-rounder? How high do you have to go for a blue-chip, given the number of first-round quarterbacks that will be taken this year and that were taken in 2018?Is it a trade for somebody another team's given up on or has no work for, like San Francisco's Nick Mullens? A veteran who will hit free agency like Nick Foles, Case Keenum or Teddy Bridgewater?How does the successor play the position? Similar to Brady in that brain/eyes/accuracy/commitment trumps legs/arm strength/versatility?MORE PATRIOTSShould Pats be interested in Demaryius Thomas? No . . . and yesOr is there an embrace of the fact that trying to find a quarterback similar to a guy who came into the league after four years at Michigan at the end of last century with a once-in-a-lifetime work ethic is a pipe dream?Aside from who the successor is and how he plays, can Brady -- the lion in winter -- be tapped to help groom whoever is being brought aboard to take over?Brady -- contrary to sexed-up speculation -- didn't actively undermine Garoppolo at any point. They were teammates. He helped Garoppolo play the position better. They became close. But he wasn't quite showing him his world, either. Brady is famous for saying he's not giving away his secrets to younger quarterbacks until after he's done.With the end-date likely to be agreed upon when he signs an extension, does he become more a mentor so that the success of the franchise has a better chance to continue after he leaves? Would the Patriots want him to do that?Or would they want a blank(ish) slate to work with that isn't saying, \"But Tom said . . . \" when they try to shape him to succeed?And that contract? What's it look like? Does Brady demand pay commensurate with what he's accomplished? Is he in the mood to do the team another financial solid given the only bump they have him in 2018 was incentives he never reached? How does that impact the structure of the team?These questions aren't new. What is new is the level of angst and anxiousness. It's dissipated tremendously.That won't make finding his replacement or choosing the means by which the Patriots will do it any easier. But it's less fraught now.The irony is, the Patriots already successfully found Brady's successor. It's just that 2014 was too soon to go looking for him.Now, can they do it again?Click here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!

Before the team's loss to the Blazers on Wednesday night, he told ESPN that he \"wants to finish his career as a Warrior.\"      View this post on Instagram    Klay wants to stay in The Bay.A post shared by  espn (@espn) on Feb 13, 2019 at 9:23pm PSTThompson is set to be an unrestricted free agent at the end of the 2018-19 season.This isn't the first time Klay has made his feelings known. Even his father Mychal, who played five seasons for the Lakers, believes his son will re-sign with the Warriors. [RELATED: For Steve Kerr, Steph Curry and Klay Thompson are mix of NBA past and present]The Warriors selected Thompson with the No. 11 overall pick in the 2011 NBA Draft. Since then, he's been a five-time NBA All-Star, three-time Finals champion and two-time All-NBA selection. Anything could happen, but it's safe to say the Klay and the Dubs have quite the relationship and are ready to tie the knot.\n"

      "        ©2019 Oath Inc. All Rights Reserved.    Yahoo Sports' Charles Robinson and Amanda Borges address the settlement between the players and the NFL, and what it means for their continuing efforts to promote social activism.The NBA jerseys of the future have a new feature to them: the ability to customize them after purchase by changing the name and number.In an awkward reveal reminiscent of a tech presentation, NBA commissioner Adam Silver and sportscaster Ahmad Rashad demonstrated the jersey at the NBA Tech Summit on Friday ahead of All-Star Weekend in Charlotte, switching a No. 30 Stephen Curry jersey to No. 23 Michael Jordan threads.Adam Silver just revealed the NBA jersey of the future that changes the name and number 🤯(via @NBA)pic.twitter.com/cgJk7KcIIU— Yahoo Sports (@YahooSports) February 15, 2019If Silver is trying to pull a Steve Jobs, perhaps he should stick to his day job. But in all seriousness, the jersey presents some interesting questions: Will it be easier for fans to “bandwagon”? Can players switch jerseys mid-game? Will Drake be first in line for this new prop?Meanwhile, Twitter had all of the jokes.Jersey cost only 20 easy installments of, $999.99.— Vod Kanockers (@JHoward2716) February 15, 2019Kevin Durant can now switch teams mid game with these new #NBA jerseys 😳 pic.twitter.com/a01rMkiexr— OT Sports Podcast Network (@OTSportsPod) February 15, 2019This could go one of two ways: Either the NBA will have found another way to separate itself from the other sports leagues or it will be a pointless feature that exists just because there is the technology to make it happen and for Twitter to crack jokes. In any case, you have to admit the NBA never fails to entertain.More from Yahoo Sports: • Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight When spring training camps opened this week around Major League Baseball, it brought hope that maybe, finally, Bryce Harper and Manny Machado would sign with teams and baseball’s long free-agent freeze would melt away.Nope. Not yet. Not only has that not happened, something else did happen: a number of talented young players around the league have agreed to team-friendly contract extensions.The latest was New York Yankees ace Luis Severino, who on Friday reportedly agreed to a four-year, $40 million deal. The deal, first reported by Joel Sherman of the New York Post, would buy up Severino’s arbitration years and comes with a $15 million club option for his first year of free agency.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]By agreeing to this deal, the Yankees and Severino avoid arbitration for 2019. He’ll make $4 million this season, $10 million next, then $10.25 million in 2021 and $11 million in 2022. The club option is for 2023. In the grand scheme of society, this is a very generous contract. In baseball’s economic bubble, it’s another young player signing for below-market value relative to his skills and potential.It’s hard to blame Severino for taking the deal, looking around at a free-agent world where Harper and Machado are still available, as are Dallas Keuchel and Craig Kimbrel. Especially since we haven’t heard even slight grumblings about teams being interested in Keuchel and Kimbrel.Coming off a breakout season in which he went 19-8 with a 3.39 ERA, the 25-year-old Severino was given a deal that’s pretty hard to turn down: “Do you want $40 million guaranteed, yes or no?”The other players faced with a similar question this week were Philadelphia Phillies ace Aaron Nola, who said yes to a four-year, $45 million deal Wednesday. It also avoided arbitration and bought out two of Nola’s free agency years, making it the most below-market deal of any of these.The Minnesota Twins locked up two of their talented young players Thursday, as right fielder Max Kepler agreed to a five-year, $35 million deal with a $10 million club option for 2024. It buys out three years of free agency for Kepler, 26. Shortstop Jorge Polanco also agreed to a five-year extension, his is worth $25.75 million with two option years that could keep him in Minnesota through 2025.In a vacuum, these types of extensions look like win-wins: The players get guaranteed money as they’re coming off good seasons. The clubs get cost-certainty to help them navigate the future — whether it’s the Yankees and Phillies trying to add big free agents this year or next, or a team like the Twins striving for contention with a homegrown core.In a bigger sense, though, it’s hard not to look at these deals in the current state of free agency and wonder if they’re a symptom of something else. Is it the market correcting itself? Is it baseball’s economy morphing into something new? Or maybe it’s just players looking around and saying, “Well, I better get my money now.”According to numerous reports, there’s a fear that for this generation of young players the light at the end of the tunnel — the big free-agency payday — won’t be there for them in the same way it was for so many other players.So while it’s great that stars like Justin Verlander, Clayton Kershaw and Max Scherzer are publicly speaking out about the current state of free agency, they’re on the right side of it. They got their mega deals.The younger players find themselves in a different sort of peril. It’s entirely possible that these are the biggest paydays these players ever get, which is a much different economic model that we’ve seen from baseball in the past.Whether it’s right or wrong — and that’s certainly something that’s up for debate heading into the next collective-bargaining agreement — baseball’s economy has often been backward. Players get paid less, relative to the market, in their pre-free agency years. The best recent example is Mike Trout winning the MVP in 2014 at age 22 while making $1 million.He got a raise to $6 million the next season, but in 2015 was still making a fraction of what people like Ryan Howard ($25M), Albert Pujols ($24M), Joe Mauer ($23M), Mark Teixeira ($22.5M) and Jose Reyes ($22M) were making.But that overpay is a necessary part baseball’s economic ecosystem too. It’s a fact: Players get overpaid as their careers decline. It’s almost like baseball’s way of making up for underpaying players during their early years. It’s baseball’s golden parachute. What’s happening these days is fewer teams are accepting that overpay as part of the how the system works.In the past few years, arbitration salaries have gotten higher and higher, and teams have tried harder to lock up younger stars before free agency. It’s why we’ve see players like Madison Bumgarner, Chris Archer, Chris Sale and Paul Goldschmidt become valuable trade chips for their team-friendly contract extensions.Teams are getting smarter about where their money goes, and how to keep value in their assets. These extensions to Severino, Nola and the rest show that they’re willing to spend money, just in the way that they want.Earlier this week, former Miami Marlins president David Samson tweeted something in response to Justin Verlander, saying the “broken system” talk was wrong. Players and their agents, Samson said, needed to adjust to a “new reality.”He may be right about the new reality part. The monster paydays at the end of the free agency tunnel could be fading away. If Bryce Harper and Manny Machado can’t get them, who can?The new reality could be players seizing their money. Whenever they can.– – – – – –Mike Oz is a writer at Yahoo Sports.

Follow @MikeOzMore from Yahoo Sports:• Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlightSt. Louis Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright became the latest player to forecast a “doom and gloom” outlook for Major League Baseball based on the growing financial and philosophical disconnect between the players and the owners.The sentiment that a strike will happen is one we’ve become accustomed to hearing from the players. However, Wainwright framed the situation with a little more urgency on Friday by expressing concerns that a day of reckoning could happen sooner than later.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]Speaking to InsideSTL.com’s Tim McKernan, Wainwright said it was inevitable that the players will go on strike unless major changes are made to help bridge the widening gap. But he’s also worried that frustrations could reach a boiling point during the season leading to some form of a revolt. Perhaps even a mid-season walkout.#STLCards pitcher Adam Wainwright on @TMASTL: “Unless something changes, there’s going to be a strike. 100%. I’m just worried people are going to walk-out mid-season.” pic.twitter.com/M8WeRVcASe— Tim McKernan (@tmckernan) February 15, 2019“Unless something changes, there’s going to be a strike. 100%,” Wainwright said regarding the free-agent freeze that has left stars like Bryce Harper and Manny Machado without contracts. “I’m just worried people are going to walkout midseason.”It’s conceivable given the current climate, but a players revolt on that level still feels like a long shot. The target date we should all still be looking at is Dec. 1, 2021. That’s when the current collective bargaining agreement ends and the owners will be forced to come to the table.That doesn’t mean we should just dismiss Wainwright’s concerns about a 2019 strike. While they might feel a little on the dramatic side, the frustration that has built all offseason as dozens of free agents, including and especially Harper and Machado, remain unsigned is becoming more palpable by the day. There’s a genuine feeling that owners are determined to cut back on salaries even as profits continue to reach new heights, it’s possible the players’ patience will run out if the free-agent freeze continues to drag on. Wainwright thinks so, and he’s far from alone.In Friday’s interview, the 37-year-old right-hander also criticized owners and front offense personnel for placing too much emphasis on “analytics” and placing everything in a “sabermetric box” that discounts intangibles and other immeasurable aspects of baseball.Adam Wainwright said today on ⁦@TMASTL⁩ that he expects there to be a strike “100%.”The context of the conversation comes from a discussion on how Bryce Harper and Manny Machado are still without teams.You can see Wainwright’s reasoning in the video below. pic.twitter.com/GXsmx4cXk1— Tim McKernan (@tmckernan) February 15, 2019Wainwright admitted that there’s always risk in making long-term financial commitments to players, but emphasized that doing so marks a commitment to winning that several teams seemingly lack.“Part of it is smart from their side of it, but you have to realize it’s about winning. So, if Bryce Harper wants 10 years and he’s 26 years old. He’s going to be a dynamic player. The same can be said about Manny Machado. These guys are superstar players.”The deeper we get into it the more obvious it is that the players know what battles lie ahead. The only real question is how much worse it will get before any progress is made toward a satisfactory resolution.More from Yahoo Sports:• Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight MLB rumors: Bryce Harper has made his decision, says D.C. radio host originally appeared on nbcsportsbayarea.comA report has come out from the East Coast saying Bryce Harper has come to a decision on which team he will play for in 2019 and beyond.Chris Russell, a sports radio talk show host from 106.7 The Fan in Washington D.C., (who has been on the Harper beat for some time) said the free agent slugger could make a decision in the next 24 hours.\"Maybe I took a little bit of a leap of faith here based on some indications I got from a real good source,\" Russell told 94WIP, in Philadelphia, on Friday.\"Bryce and his representatives, (Scott) Boras, his people, his wife Kayla, they've been meeting since Monday morning in Vegas. Bryce originally wanted this done, when it took this long, by Valentine's Day. Obviously, the contract has not been announced, signed, or whatever.\"\"But I'm led to believe by the people that I've talked to that are close to the situation -- and I have, again, a real good source that has helped me through this process, let's just leave it at that,\" Russell said. \"That Bryce was in a mood to celebrate yesterday. Now, the source said, 'I believe it's done.' I don't have concrete, 100 percent proof for you guys. I wish I did, otherwise, I would have it and I would be running around with it. But I don't have that, so I want to caution everybody in Philadelphia. But that's what I was led to believe, that this thing is now decided.\"Russell then mentioned the Phillies.\"Now, what comes then is hammering out a contract. And if we were to believe the report that the Philadelphia Phillies had not even extended a formal offer -- and I assume that to be a termed, written agreement, that type of thing, which I find hard to believe -- then there might be more legwork to this. And therefore, hey the decision may be done, but the contract still needs to be ironed out.\"[RELATED: Phillies fan participates in \"lent\" in hopes of recruiting Harper]Russell is being safe with the terminology he's using, which is understandable. And while we haven't been able to confirm these rumors, Harper, along with many other free agents, remains unsigned.The Giants appeared to be the \"mystery team\" that introduced themselves late into the Harper sweepstakes -- and when the radio hosts asked Russell his opinion on where the outfielder will end up next season, he believed Harper will be in an orange and black uniform.\"I don't think it's going to be the Nationals,\" Russell said. \"I think it's going to be the San Francisco Giants, but that is not by any means an 'I know that for a fact,' so I want to caution everybody -- I know how this works -- I get in trouble with everything I say on my radio show, and everyone blows it up.\" The wait continues ... Golden State Warriors stars Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant empathised with Steve Kerr after the head coach was ejected during the loss to the Portland Trail Blazers having thrown a clipboard in response to a flagrant foul call.Kerr was enraged late in the fourth quarter when Draymond Green was called for a flagrant foul after he stopped Zach Collins from approaching the rim as he went up for a shot.That drew Kerr's ire and after ranting in one referee's face, he slammed a clipboard down to earn an ejection, with Durant having to escort his head coach back off the court.The Warriors lost the game 129-107 but will still head into the All-Star break with the best record in the Western Conference.\"It was an emotional game. We fought really hard for 43 minutes,\" Curry told reporters afterwards.\"One questionable decision - the flagrant - obviously the fire came out. You see coach go and throw a clipboard. At that point you try to get us over the hump. An eight-point swing, it's tough to overcome.\"\"I looked at the replay and the amount of ball [Green] got, there was nothing excessive about it, he got all the ball.\"There was a lot of chirping, with Zach involved. There was probably a sensitivity to it, trying to put out some fires, but I thought it was a terrible call. We obviously paid the price for it with how everything unfolded after that.\"Durant shared that sympathy having been the one to pull Kerr away from the referees as he continued to rant at them.\"I felt for him, I understand his anger and his rage, especially for that call,\" he said.\"I thought we should have just kept playing, It was a common foul, I thought. Refs looked at it differently. \"I understand why coach was a little frustrated.\"Kerr explained that it was the disbelief at the call that had triggered his reaction.\"I was just shocked that that was called a flagrant foul,\" he said. \"I'm not sure how it's determined - if it's in New York or the officials on the call - but that was head-scratching: that that could be called a flagrant foul.\"The guy's going to go in for a dunk, you've got to make sure he doesn't dunk it.\"So, I told Kenny [Mauer] that I beg to differ. There might have been a couple of other words in there too!\"I'll have to ask the owner if the clipboard broke when I threw it down. I got a little anger out so that was good. I was too busy yelling to ask for an explanation.\"Charles Barkley thinks New Orleans Pelicans star Anthony Davis made a mistake with his trade request.The 25-year-old asked the Pelicans to move him in late January and the Los Angeles Lakers had been engaged in discussions about acquiring him. But, no deal was reached before the deadline and Davis remained with New Orleans.Barkley, an 11-time All-Star who works as an analyst for TNT, said he thinks Davis and his agent, Rich Paul, mishandled the situation.\"Don't ruin your reputation as a great player, one of the nicest guys in the world,\" Barkley told reporters on Thursday ahead of All-Star weekend (via the Washington Post).\"Remember, your agent works for you, you don't work for him. They handled that situation wrong. It's going to come back to bite them in the a***. It's unfortunate.\"The six-time All-Star entered play on Thursday averaging 28.5 points and 13.1 rebounds this season. But, he scored just three points in 24 minutes on the floor in the Pelicans' 118-88 loss to the Orlando Magic earlier this week.\"This is a bad situation,\" Barkley said. \"It's a bad look for the NBA. Because that kid can't go out there and give 100 per cent because he’s worried about getting hurt. The guy's the second-best player in the world and he's got three points? That's not a good look for the NBA.\"The Boston Celtics and New York Knicks, among others, are expected to explore dealing for Davis after the season. Barkley, however, said he believes the forward will eventually land in Los Angeles because of Paul's relationship with Lakers star LeBron James.Barkley tallied 22.1 points and 11.7 rebounds per game over his 16-year career. He retired in 2000 and was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame six years later.After an apology from Sergio Garcia, a non-apology from Matt Kuchar, and an uncooperative Mother Nature on Valentine's Day, it's time for everyone to focus again on Tiger Woods. Kidding. Sort of. A weather-delayed first round at Riviera re-starts on Friday morning and the 14-time major champ will be in the Hollywood-area spotlight as he finally begins his Genesis Open. And golf fans could potentially see a LOT of the tournament host as the event tries to play catch up after heavy rains on Thursday.Woods, Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas (Decent group, eh?) are scheduled to tee off at 8:32 local time (11:32 ET). The hope is they will complete their first rounds and then play as much of their second rounds as possible before darkness. And Tiger's hope is to finally win for the first time at this historic layout where he missed the cut last year. We'll be tracking Tiger every step of the way so keep it right here for the latest scores, news and highlights. (All times eastern)SATURDAY, 11:25: With a 25-foot birdie putt on No. 9, Woods' final hole of the second round, Tiger will likely make the cut. The birdie brought Woods back to even on his round and to one under overall.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096808527694245890After resuming play in the morning, Woods bogeyed his first hole, No. 4, then made four pars before his finishing birdie. His playing partners, however, fared much better. Justin Thomas shares the lead with Adam Scott at 11 under and Rory McIlroy birdied four of his six holes on Saturday morning to shoot 63 and move to seven under through 36 holes. Thursday's early wave is now on the course for their second rounds.-------------------FRIDAY-------------------8:25: And with that, the horn has sounded—play will be suspended for darkness on Friday at Riviera. Tiger, JT and Rory have six more holes to complete their second round. Justin Thomas is at 10-under, tied with Adam Scott for the lead. Tiger will hope Saturday brings some different momentum for him—as this marathon day ends with two bogeys in a row after the highlight eagle.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10965708926692065298:21: That's back-to-back bogeys now for Tiger Woods, dropping another shot here at the third hole (his 12th of the round). And over his past six holes, Tiger has four bogeys. The birdie at No. 1 helped negate most of that damage ... but Tiger's back to 1-under again—right on the current cut line.8:13: On his 30th hole of the day, Tiger is showing some obvious signs of being tired. And who could blame him—he's been playing golf for nearly 10 hours straight. From 165 yards out at the third hole, Tiger Woods tries to chop out a 6-iron and comes out of it. His ball comes to rest short of the green. With sunset in Pacific Palisades being 5:30 local time, this group will have time for maybe one more hole today.8:04: Tiger follows up that eagle putt at No. 1 with a bogey at the second hole. The third bogey of his second round moves Tiger back to 2-under overall.7:56: After a long wait at the second hole, Tiger sprays his second shot from 235 out with a fairway wood out to the right. He'll have his work cut out from the front right bunker to save par at the 482-yard par 4.7:40: This is exactly what Tiger Woods needed: He rolls in his 43-foot eagle putt at his 10th hole (the first) to get back to 3-under—negating those two bogeys he made on his front nine. What a putt! With the flagstick in!https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096570892669206529Tiger made a disappointing par to open his first round earlier today at the first hole. The unlikely eagle makes up for that effort—and could turn around Tiger's second round in a dramatic way. Tiger goes from toeing the cut line at 1-under to now all of a sudden being T-21.7:28: Tiger finds the fairway at the par-5 first hole, the group's 10th hole of their second round, as he attempts to get a shot back here after bogeying two of his final three holes on his front nine. Neither bogey was particularly bad—the 18th hole is playing brutally tough right now uphill and into the wind with the rain, making it even more of a challenging hole. And his break at 16 was very unlucky.7:16: Tiger and JT are gonna have their work cut out to save par at the 18th hole (their ninth). Each player had fairway wood approaches and tried playing a big cut. JT was way up left on the hill—Tiger was closer. He went high with his approach and will have about 11 feet left for par.Tiger misses the par putt, so he'll drop a shot along with JT as they make the turn. Tiger moves back to 1-under after 27 holes. That's where the cut line currently is—so all of a sudden, Tiger must be concerned about making the cut.7:01: Following Justin Thomas throwing a dart at the 17th to about 3 feet, Tiger puts his wedge shot from under 100 yards to outside 20 feet, so he'll be disappointed with that effort. The birdie putt misses on the high side, and Tiger taps in for par to remain at 2-under. His playing partner and buddy Justin Thomas stays hot, rolling in a fourth straight birdie to get to 9-under—tied for the lead with Adam Scott. Really impressive golf here from JT.6:54: The rain is really coming down now as the players head to the 17th hole. Tiger finds the fairway at the par-5 17th hole, but it was a short one—he has 326 yards left. Most players have been laying up at this par 5 all day.6:43: From a brutal position up against the back lip of the bunker, Tiger hacks it out—and somehow keeps the ball on the green, albeit the back portion. His par attempt from 44 feet away here comes up three feet shy. Tiger makes his bogey to move back to 2-under.Meanwhile, Justin Thomas is officially on fire. He has another birdie after a fabulous tee shot at 16. It's now two Kentucky boys tied at the top: Justin Thomas and J.B. Holmes (-8).https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10965576791939317766:39: Tiger will have serious lie issues at the par-3 16th hole. His tee shot came to rest up against the back lip of the bunker. As Billy Kratzert just remarked on PGA Tour Live, Tiger will do well just to keep this ball on the green. Though he avoided dropping a shot on his last hole, there might be a bogey in his future here.6:35: A clutchhh par save by Tiger at the 15th hole makes up for his poor chip—and Tiger keeps the momentum going on his second round, as he stays 3-under for the tournament and 2-under on the round.Justin Thomas, also in Tiger's group, holed out from in front of the green for birdie at the 14th hole, and he makes a long birdie putt at 15 to get to 7-under—just one back of fellow Kentucky native J.B. Holmes.6:32: A poor chip shot from Tiger at the 15th hole leaves him about 13 feet away. He'll need to convert that putt to prevent dropping his first shot of his second round.6:24: Tiger finds another fairway here at Riviera, this one at the 15th hole. The guy is feeeling it with his driver. Almost on auto pilot. His approach from 190 out turns a little too much, finding the rough to the left of the green. He'll have to get up and down to avoid dropping one here.6:20: From 20 feet out, Tiger's birdie bid comes up shy—never really scaring the hole, despite getting a good look at the line from Rory's putt. Tiger taps in for par to remain at 3-under.The putter has been disappointing for Tiger all day: He had 34 putts in his first round, including four three-putts, just the third time in his career he's done that.6:13: Tiger puts his tee shot at the par-3 14th hole just inside Rory's ball—about 20 feet right of the hole. He'll get a little teach from Rory's putt, too, as Tiger continues to hit it well today.6:07: Tiger just misses the left-to-right curling bid for birdie, leaving himself with an easy par at 13. He stays 3-under for the tournament and -2 through four on his round.Tiger's playing partners are also playing well—Rory has three birdies in his first four holes to get to 2-under. Look out for Rory at rainy Riviera. And Justin Thomas, despite hitting his tee shot out of bounds at 13, got up and down from 160 yards to avoid dropping multiple shots. He's now 5-under after that bogey.6:02: Another grooved tee shot for Tiger Woods at the 13th hole puts him in good position. He turned over his tee shot—putting his draw in the middle of the fairway at the dogleg left. Tiger spins his approach back to about 15 feet, just off the green in the fringe. He'll have a chance to knock another one here and keep the momentum going.5:51: Bang! Tiger nails the 25-footer for birdie at the 12th hole to add a second birdie to his card through three holes. Realistically, too, it could be three straight birdies for Tiger. But the 14-time major champion is now 2-under through 3—T-3 for the tournament (T-19)—and carries some strong momentum on his side at the start of his second round ... as the rain is coming down at Riviera.5:46: Tiger hits his approach hole high—about 25 feet from 181 yards. He'll have another chance to add a birdie to his third round.Tiger's currently at 2-under, which puts him at T-29. The projected cut is at 1-under—so he's comfortably inside the number as of now. But there's a ton of golf to be played, obviously.5:41: Tiger finds the fairway with his driver at the par-4 12th hole. The 12th usually plays as one of the toughest holes at Riviera—we'll see if Tiger can take advantage of his position here in the fairway.5:33: An excellent fairway-wood second shot by Tiger put him right in front of the par-5 11th green in two. But a very poor approach putt for his third leaves him more than 10 feet away. His birdie try slides by for a very disappointing par being so close in 2. That should've been a golden opportunity to start his second round with two birdies—instead, Tiger stays at 2-under.5:12: Tiger goes high with his pitch—having to navigate around the front bunker, and plays it nicely—spinning it about 7 feet short of the hole. So Tiger will have a good look for an opening birdie to start his second round. Tiger converts the birdie putt to move to 2-under.5:02: Only a little more than a half hour after finishing his first round, Tiger Woods (-1) -- along with Justin Thomas (-5) and Rory McIlroy (+1) -- has teed off in his second round. The group started on the drivable 10th hole, and Tiger has driven his tee shot just off the green. He'll have a chance to put his pitch shot close to start his second round with a birdie.4:24: Tiger narrowly misses the birdie putt at the 18th hole, so he'll tap in for a par and an opening-round, one-under 70 at Riviera. Having three-putted for a fourth time on the 17th hole to drop a shot in disappointing fashion, Tiger will head to his second round a bit frustrated. But the four consecutive birdies showed him being able to score well at Riviera, where he has never won.Tiger, JT (who birdied 18 to finish at 5-under) and Rory will head right back for their second round in this marathon day for them.4:18: Tiger responds to that shocking three-putt with a perfect drive and a towering 6-iron on Riviera's famed 18th. Woods is in good shape to at least make par the difficult hole, but as we've seen all day, a two-putt is anything but automatic.Here's an unusual stat on Tiger three-putting four times this afternoon. He's making some history in a bad way...https://twitter.com/JustinRayGolf/status/10965196250582507574:06: So much for the momentum. . . After a decent approach shot that spins back to about 20 feet, Woods runs his birdie putt a couple feet by and. . . gulp. . . misses the comebacker from about two feet. Wow. That's four three-putts on the day as Tiger falls back to one under with one hole to play.3:57: Uh-oh, it's raining in southern California again. Meanwhile, Woods is plodding his way up the par-5 17th. After pulling his drive into the left rough and drawing a poor lie, Woods pushed his layup slightly into the first cut of the right rough. He'll have a some sort of wedge to a back-right hole location.3:50: Tiger's tee shot was tracking on the par-3 16th, but it comes up about 30 feet short. From there, he two-putts for par to remain at two under. Justin Thomas makes his 10-foot birdie effort to move to four under, while Rory McIlroy remains at one over. McIlroy hast two holes to avert his first over-par score of 2019.3:40: After another great drive and a solid approach, Woods races his birdie attempt nearly five feet past the hole. But he keeps the overall positive momentum going by converting the par putt to remain at two under. Tiger has three more holes to play. At least, before he gets a lunch break.3:24: BANG! There's the bounce back from Tiger. It just came one hole later. And from farther away as Woods drains his 12-footer for birdie on No. 14.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096507996031467520Woods is now back to two under, five shots behind Jordan Spieth, who has to be pleased to still be in front by two despite these soft conditions.3:17: Tiger hits a great shot on the difficult par-3 14th hole to about 15 feet. He'll have a good look at birdie coming up. In the meantime, here's a look at how the leader board stands with Jordan Spieth still leading the way.Jordan Spieth (-7) 2t. Tony Finau (-5) 2t. Patrick Rodgers (-5) 2t. Kramer Hickok (-5) 2t. Davis Love III (-5) 2t. Adam Scott (-5) 2t. J.B. Homes (-5)Click here for full scores.3:13: Woods stuck his approach to about four feet below the hole on No. 13. A bounce back birdie looked like a forgone conclusion until he pushed his effort. Woof. That's two three-putts and two short misses on the greens for Tiger today. He remains at one under. Meanwhile, Rory McIlroy, after getting to two under through eight, has fallen to one over after back-to-back bogeys. Justin Thomas, the third player in the group, continues to lead this trio at three under.3:05: After hitting fade after fade, Woods steps to the 13th tee and rips a draw around the corner, perfectly setting up his next shot. Good to see him working it both ways with ease.3:01: Tiger pushed his tee shot into the right rough, then hit a fantastic recovery shot from a thick lie onto the green. He had a long look at birdie that rolled about four feet past, leaving him with a tricky left-to-right par putt, which he missed. That's three three putts on the day for Woods, and he's still one under.2:39: Not the best chip from Woods, as he left himself about six feet for birdie, but he makes it anyway. Four straight for Tiger to get to two under for the day.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10964952191957975042:30: Woods rips a 3-wood from 269 to just in front of the green. Hate to jinx him, but there's no reason he shouldn't easily make his fourth straight birdie here (ducks).2:20: Three in a row for Woods as he rolls in another at No. 10 and moves to one under. If he finds the fairway again at the 11th, four in a row will be in his sights. Meanwhile, Rory makes his par to stay at one under and JT ends up holing his 10 footer for birdie to get to four under. Finally a little bit of JUICE from this threesome.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096489287753711616https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096489787672780800By the way, it looks like we know when they'll be heading back out for round two later today. Here's an update from the Tiger Tracker:https://twitter.com/GCTigerTracker/status/1096481806067523585That should give them enough time to get at least 11 or 12 holes in.At the 11th, Woods stripes another drive down the fairway. He's really starting to cook.2:12: Tiger's shot was a tad more difficult than we thought, as he had to avoid a bunker and take it up high to get it back to the pin. He was successful, sticking it to about three feet. Hell of a shot. Even better was Rory's shot, as he flopped it from a nice lie and got it to hang on just off the back of the green and stay out of the back bunker. Thomas, who had the easiest shot, put too much spin on his chip, leaving himself with about 10 feet for birdie.2:07: Finally, Tiger, Rory and JT hit their tee shots, and it looks like the ensuing entertainment will be well worth the wait. Tiger is in the collection area left of the green, where he has a straightforward chip that should set him up with a good chance to make birdie. Thomas is just in front of the green, and he'll have a great chance to make a birdie as well. Rory ... um ... not so much. He's in the rough with a greenside bunker in front of him and a pin he won't be able to get close to, and just holding the green would be a miracle.1:52: Woods drains his four-footer for bird and turns in even par 35. Real strong finish to his opening nine, and now it looks like he'll have a long wait at the 10th. DeChambeau, Kuchar and Rahm have still yet to hit their tee shots.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10964831254067896321:47: Tiger had just 122 left to the green and stuck one in there close. He has four feet left for birdie to turn in even par, which would be a small victory after that ugly three putt back at No. 7. Not to mention he'll have a prime opportunity to get into red figures at the driveable par-4 10th.1:41: Woods cranks another high fade right down the middle with the driver at No. 9. With the tees up today, he'll have a low iron in his hand for his approach.1:34: And he's on the board! Woods bounces back with a birdie putt from 15 feet, getting him back to one over. We'll see if that gets him going before making the turn.1:30: From 125 yards out, Woods hit a wedge and hated it from the second he made contact. While he did pull it, he's still hole high and inside 20 feet. Hideki Matsuyama-esque move from Tiger.1:24: Woods rips one right down the middle at the par-4 eighth. Should have a short iron in.1:15: Tiger's birdie putt was actually from just off the green on the fringe, and he rolled it by some four feet. Then, he missed the comebacker for par, dropping to two over on the day. Oof.1:09: Fairway and a green for Woods at the seventh. Good look at birdie coming up to get back to level par.12:58: Another hole, another par for Woods, who two-putted from 24 feet on the par-3 sixth. In the group up ahead, though, Jon Rahm is making a move at three under through six.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/109646557828021452912:47: Another meh hole for Tiger on No. 5, just missing the fairway with his tee shot, finding the front of the green with a so-so approach, and two-putting for another par from 43 feet. Woods remains at one over through five holes while his playing partners, McIlroy and Thomas, both remain at one under.12:42: As Matt Kuchar's ball is in the air on the par-3 sixth, a fan yells, \"Go low—just not with the gratuity!\" Despite Matt maintaining this is \"not a story,\" it is. And this won't be the last comment like this.12:29: Woods hit a nice shot to about 15 feet on the par-3 fourth, but ran his birdie effort by the hole. Still one over. Still no highlights. At least, from Tiger. Here was Spieth's closing birdie from about an hour ago, because there is not much else exciting going on right now.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/109644546143346688112:17: Another missed fairway and another short approach from Tiger on the par-4 third. Although, Woods found the putting surface, he was unable to two-putt from 63 feet, missing a seven-footer for par after badly misreading his first putt. That drops Tiger to one over through three holes. Not a lot of highlights so far. . .12:02: Tiger misses right off the tee on No. 2 then comes up short on another approach. But his pitch shot nearly goes down, leaving him with a tap-in par. Even par through two holes.11:49: After that perfect opening tee shot, Tiger hit a hideous approach with a 5-iron that came up way short in a fairway bunker. From there, he hit his third to 10 feet but missed the putt to walk away with a disappointing par. Both of Tiger's playing partners, McIlroy and Thomas, make birdie.11:38: Matt Kuchar just misses his eagle attempt from 25 feet on No. 1, but taps in for birdie. Kuchar has been in the news a lot this week over a caddie controversy dating back to his win at the Mayakoba Golf Classic. A controversy he didn't help with his comments on Wednesday. Is it possible some of those \"Kuuuuch\" shouts will turn to \"Mooooch\"? Kinda sounded like it on the first hole. . .11:34: Jordan Spieth is in with a seven-under-par 64 to take the early lead. Spieth needed only 21 putts during his bogey-free round. Of course, starting tournaments hasn't been a problem for Spieth of late. Finishing, however, has been a different story. Incredibly, Spieth is looking for his first win since the 2017 British Open and his first top 5 since last year's Masters.11:32: Woods smashes a driver off the first tee that finds the fairway. The opening par 5 at Riviera is essentially a long par 4 and one of the easiest holes on the PGA Tour all year so Tiger is thinking at least birdie after that tee shot.10:53: So far, so good on the Friday weather:https://twitter.com/GCTigerTracker/status/1096437235262533632And with lift, clean and place in play (for at least the first round), low scores are out there. Let's set the over/under on the Par-71 layout at 68.5.10:45: We are approximately 45 minutes away from Tiger's tee time and it's another major champ who is already off to a fantastic start. Jordan Spieth has the lead at six under through 15 holes. Spieth leads Patrick Rodgers by one and then there's a big group at four under, including Bill Haas, who is playing in the event a year after being involved in a car accident during last year's tournament that killed a friend he was staying with. Make sure you read Brian Wacker's piece from earlier in the week on how Haas is still trying to move on from that tragedy.10:35: As we move within an hour from Tiger teeing off, check out GOLFTV's latest behind-the-scenes video with Woods in which he says his bag has up to 16(!) golf gloves during rainy rounds and he explains why he doesn't like wearing rain jackets:https://twitter.com/GOLFTV/status/1096246456795697153\"Pops used to say, 'Once you're wet, you're wet.

Once he started running the front office, his blinking at Paul George on national TV contributed to the Lakers getting fined again for tampering. Johnson’s praise of Giannis Antetokounmpo drew yet another tampering fine.So, though he escaped punishment for his recent comments on 76ers guard Ben Simmons, Johnson refused to answer a question about Hornets guard Kemba Walker.Carolina Blitz:Asked Magic about Kemba and he said y’all aren’t going to catch him slipping anymore. pic.twitter.com/sQZtIWnQbn— Carolina Blitz (@KeepBlitzin) February 15, 2019Johnson:You know I can’t answer any questions about no players, because every time I do it, I get fined. But anybody else do it, they don’t get fined. So I’m going to stay away from that one.I don’t blame Johnson for feeling that way.Other teams’ owners, coaches and executives have repeatedly publicly discussed rival players without facing announced punishment.To be fair, the NBA doesn’t reveal every fine. Bucks owner Marc Lasry reportedly just got fined for tampering, but the league never announced it. But, at minimum, there’s an inconsistency with how the NBA exposes Johnson’s transgressions.Even NBA commissioner Adam Silver said last year there’s a spotlight on the Lakers due to prior tampering. That strikes me as unfair. The Lakers already paid for their prior violations and should now be held to the same standard as everyone else.And for what it’s worth, I wish that standard allowed an all-time great point guard like Johnson to publicly share his thoughts on Kemba Walker.Gareth Bale has landed himself in hot water after La Liga denounced the Real Madrid star for his celebration in the Madrid derby, which could carry a ban of four to 12 games.The Welsh forward scored as a substitute in the 3-1 victory over Atletico Madrid, bringing up his 100th goal for the club.And during the celebrations that followed, Bale \"lifted his right arm near his head in a clear sign of provocation towards the fans, then giving a gesture which could be seen as obscene and disdainful by folding his arm and striking it with his other hand.\"In a statement released by La Liga, Bale’s punishment will be decided by whether he incited the crowd or not.If Bale is guilty of “inciting opposition fans” to cause a hostile reaction, the punishment could carry four to 12 games, if there was no hostile reaction but intent, then it could be as little as one to three games.The gesture is referred to in Spain as ‘corte de mangas,’ with the moment not picked up in the referee’s match report.A committee will now decide whether the gesture merits a punishment.Bale also featured in Real’s Champions League victory over Ajax.Los Blancos take a 2-1 lead back to the Bernabeu for the second leg of the last 16 tie after Marco Asensio’s late winner.Earlier this week Heisman Trophy winner — and first round draft pick of the Oakland Athletics — Kyler Murray chose football over baseball, committing himself to the NFL draft.

In the last month alone he's won his 44th PGA Tour event, finished second in another, hit every fairway in a round for the first time in 21 years, shot a 60, pulled off this impossible recovery shot, gone viral just by rolling his eyes and said he might drop the Players from his schedule because he's already won it (a literal mic drop). The man simply cannot be stopped right now.Leave it to the weather to literally rain on Lefty's parade. On Thursday at the Genesis Open, Mickelson began his first round at the difficult short par-4 10th and drove into one of the bunkers up near the green, leaving him with a dreaded lengthy sand shot. He wound up hitting it over the green, and his ball plugged in the back bunker, setting up an even harder shot than he just had. As you'll hear PGA Tour Live commentator Shane Bacon say, avoiding making a six was probably the goal, but after Mickelson hit his third into another bunker on the other side of the green, a six suddenly became best-case scenario. How does a four sound instead?https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096076528142626818Find us a more Phil Mickelson par ever... you can't. He's always got a flair for the dramatic. The problem?

(Old man golfers)The dust is barely settled in the wake of the end of the Markelle Fultz era in Philadelphia, and the former 76ers guard is already taking shots at his old team.His old coach Brett Brown in particular.Fultz had his introductory press conference with the Orlando Magic on Thursday after being traded at last week’s deadline and praised his new coach Steve Clifford while taking a veiled shot at Brown.“It just excites me to know that I have a coach that’s going to push you to be better and not just going to tell you what you want to hear,” Fultz said.That’s direct praise for his new coach. But the message for Brown is clear. Fultz didn’t like what he heard from the Philadelphia coaching staff.Fultz never had any public dispute with the 76ers, but it was evident that he and the team had different approaches to the struggles that saw him shoot 41.4 percent from the field, 26.7 percent from 3-point distance and 53.4 percent from the line in limited action after being selected as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2017 draft.It’s still not clear whether injury or a mental block – or both – are the cause of his shooting issues.After his agent announced that the nerve disorder thoracic outlet syndrome was the root of the shooting woes, Fultz never played again for the 76ers.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]Fultz appears to be fully embracing the fresh start in Orlando as a player and a person.“I think the biggest thing we talked about what doing thing the right way,” Fultz said. “Just building me up both as a man and on the court. I think that’s music to my ears, really just. Two things I really want to do is be the best player I can be and be the best young man I can be.”Fultz described the experience of his nerve disorder to reporters.“It’s hard to lift up your arms, you lose feeling in your fingers,” Fultz said. “You can’t tell when it’s going to happen. It’s not like you do the same motion every time. You get tingling in your fingers, numbness. Stuff like that.”He also curtly dismissed any notion that his shooting struggles are due to anything but injury.“I had an injury,” Fultz said. “I was out there trying to play through that. I never lost confidence.”Asked about a timetable to return, Fultz dodged the question to talk about rehab.“Right now it’s just about getting everything the right way,” he said. “Rehab’s been going great. I’m just taking my time and doing everything the right way.”More from Yahoo Sports: • PGA Tour pro defends paying caddie $5K on $1.3M win • NFL bars NCAA’s all-time sack leader from combine • Only one NBA team failed to scout Antetokounmpo • Black History honor for Kaepernick sacked by lawmakers He might not be well known to NFL fans at large, but New England Patriots fans know linebacker Kyle Van Noy — acquired basically for free from the Detroit Lions at the 2016 trade deadline — has been a big part of the defense the last two years, and has a knack for making plays at the right time.Van Noy is getting a little shine after winning his second Super Bowl ring with New England, appearing on the “Pardon My Take” podcast on Thursday to dish on all things Patriots and Super Bowl LIII.One thing that Van Noy revealed: the Los Angeles Rams didn’t do anything surprising during the game on offense.“I couldn’t believe that,” Van Noy said. “They really didn’t do — not one wrinkle. I was like, ‘What the hell?’ They’ve got so many good players, they’ve got so many things they’ve done all year, and the one play they gave us which was a wrinkle was the [Brandin] Cooks screen that hit for a little bit.“And that was it… Or maybe too, we were playing so good they were like, ‘[Expletive], we don’t know what to do.’ ”Hindsight, of course, is 20-20, but given that the Patriots’ coaching staff is known for having its players prepared for any and everything, it seems unwise that Los Angeles didn’t add some new plays or looks to try to stump New England.Van Noy said the Patriots’ culture, specifically coach Bill Belichick’s practice of not sparing anyone in the film room, even Tom Brady, is part of why the team continues to win.“Oh yeah. Yeah, that [stuff is] sick, to be honest, because it sets the table,” Van Noy said. “Like, OK, it doesn’t matter who you are, everyone’s on an even playing field. This is how it is here at work. You come in and you earn everything.“And I respect that because I felt like that gave me a chance to get on the field when I came in mid-year, and [Belichick] was like, ‘It doesn’t matter who you are or what you’ve done. You earn your keep.’ ”More from Yahoo Sports: • Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight The Brady Conundrum: How do you go about replacing the GOAT? originally appeared on nbcsportsboston.comThe Patriots hatched a Tom Brady succession plan after the 2013 season when they drafted Jimmy Garoppolo.Brady blew that up.Now, five years, four Super Bowl appearances, three Super Bowl wins, two Super Bowl MVPs and a regular-season MVP later, it's time to gingerly -- caaaauuuuuutiooooousssssllllyyyyy -- begin the process again.This time should be different.Even though Brady's contract hasn't been extended past the 2019 season, the love and happiness we saw on the field after the Rams were dispatched in SB53 is a good sign.MORE PATRIOTSAreas of Change: Will Pats be able to retain free agents Trey Flowers and Trent Brown?Brady's wariness about the Patriots' plans for him, and Bill Belichick's wariness about wedding his team to a quarterback who's closer to 50 years old than he is to 30, has dissipated.Once a new deal is in place -- Jonathan Kraft indicated that might be before training camp, though as of the Super Bowl conversations hadn't started -- Brady will have a written assurance that he will leave the Patriots and the NFL on his terms.That wasn't the case in early 2014 when the soon-to-be-37-year-old Brady saw the Patriots spend a first-round pick on a defensive tackle (Dominique Easley) and their second-rounder on Garoppolo. That, after a '13 season Brady spent throwing to the likes of Aaron Dobson, Josh Boyce, Kenbrell Thompkins and Austin Collie.Garoppolo was a stick of dynamite under Brady's behind. He was the existential threat Brady feared made flesh.Jimmy might have thought he was drafted to learn how to play quarterback in the NFL and have a nice career. To Brady, Garoppolo was there to take his job, throw his career into upheaval, uproot his family and see Brady cast out into the NFL wilderness.MORE PATRIOTSPerry: If Beckham is on the trade block, should Patriots be willing to pay the price?And, in contrast to the guy Brady succeeded in 2001 (and, by extension, did all those things to), Brady wasn't going to snort derisively at the plucky little draft pick here to take his job. He would crush the threat.He did.Brady played so well that -- despite Garoppolo developing into a bona-fide front-line quarterback under Belichick and Josh McDaniels (and Brady) -- Brady left the ever-prepared Patriots with no recourse when Garoppolo's contract was about to expire.Brady was too good to bench and too important to trade. Garoppolo was too expensive to franchise and too smart to take a \"bridge\" contract so he could watch Brady from the sidelines while his own hair started to gray at the temples. So off he went around Halloween, 2017.A lot's happened in the 16 months since.MORE PATRIOTSPhil Perry's Mock Draft 1.0: Pats start looking for Gronk's replacementBut now here we are, in the offseason of Brady's 42nd year. And the complex question of how to find the player who will eventually replace the greatest quarterback in NFL history still lingers.Do you draft his successor? If you do, do you do it this year? Do you do it next year?Do you try to get into the top 10 to get your pick of the litter? Do you stay put, confident that the muttonheads across the league will miss out as they did with Brady and Garoppolo (or Aaron Rodgers, Russell Wilson, Drew Brees, Brett Favre, Johnny Unitas . . . you get the point)? How much will it cost to get into the top 10? Do you package picks from this season -- when you will have six in the first three rounds -- and pick a sucker who will suck next year and fleece them for their 2020 first-rounder? How high do you have to go for a blue-chip, given the number of first-round quarterbacks that will be taken this year and that were taken in 2018?Is it a trade for somebody another team's given up on or has no work for, like San Francisco's Nick Mullens? A veteran who will hit free agency like Nick Foles, Case Keenum or Teddy Bridgewater?How does the successor play the position? Similar to Brady in that brain/eyes/accuracy/commitment trumps legs/arm strength/versatility?MORE PATRIOTSShould Pats be interested in Demaryius Thomas? No . . . and yesOr is there an embrace of the fact that trying to find a quarterback similar to a guy who came into the league after four years at Michigan at the end of last century with a once-in-a-lifetime work ethic is a pipe dream?Aside from who the successor is and how he plays, can Brady -- the lion in winter -- be tapped to help groom whoever is being brought aboard to take over?Brady -- contrary to sexed-up speculation -- didn't actively undermine Garoppolo at any point. They were teammates. He helped Garoppolo play the position better. They became close. But he wasn't quite showing him his world, either. Brady is famous for saying he's not giving away his secrets to younger quarterbacks until after he's done.With the end-date likely to be agreed upon when he signs an extension, does he become more a mentor so that the success of the franchise has a better chance to continue after he leaves? Would the Patriots want him to do that?Or would they want a blank(ish) slate to work with that isn't saying, \"But Tom said . . . \" when they try to shape him to succeed?And that contract? What's it look like? Does Brady demand pay commensurate with what he's accomplished? Is he in the mood to do the team another financial solid given the only bump they have him in 2018 was incentives he never reached? How does that impact the structure of the team?These questions aren't new. What is new is the level of angst and anxiousness. It's dissipated tremendously.That won't make finding his replacement or choosing the means by which the Patriots will do it any easier. But it's less fraught now.The irony is, the Patriots already successfully found Brady's successor. It's just that 2014 was too soon to go looking for him.Now, can they do it again?Click here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!

Before the team's loss to the Blazers on Wednesday night, he told ESPN that he \"wants to finish his career as a Warrior.\"      View this post on Instagram    Klay wants to stay in The Bay.A post shared by  espn (@espn) on Feb 13, 2019 at 9:23pm PSTThompson is set to be an unrestricted free agent at the end of the 2018-19 season.This isn't the first time Klay has made his feelings known. Even his father Mychal, who played five seasons for the Lakers, believes his son will re-sign with the Warriors. [RELATED: For Steve Kerr, Steph Curry and Klay Thompson are mix of NBA past and present]The Warriors selected Thompson with the No. 11 overall pick in the 2011 NBA Draft. Since then, he's been a five-time NBA All-Star, three-time Finals champion and two-time All-NBA selection. Anything could happen, but it's safe to say the Klay and the Dubs have quite the relationship and are ready to tie the knot.\n"

Yahoo Sports' Charles Robinson and Amanda Borges address the settlement between the players and the NFL, and what it means for their continuing efforts to promote social activism.The NBA jerseys of the future have a new feature to them: the ability to customize them after purchase by changing the name and number.In an awkward reveal reminiscent of a tech presentation, NBA commissioner Adam Silver and sportscaster Ahmad Rashad demonstrated the jersey at the NBA Tech Summit on Friday ahead of All-Star Weekend in Charlotte, switching a No. 30 Stephen Curry jersey to No. 23 Michael Jordan threads.Adam Silver just revealed the NBA jersey of the future that changes the name and number 🤯(via @NBA)pic.twitter.com/cgJk7KcIIU— Yahoo Sports (@YahooSports) February 15, 2019If Silver is trying to pull a Steve Jobs, perhaps he should stick to his day job. But in all seriousness, the jersey presents some interesting questions: Will it be easier for fans to “bandwagon”? Can players switch jerseys mid-game? Will Drake be first in line for this new prop?Meanwhile, Twitter had all of the jokes.Jersey cost only 20 easy installments of, $999.99.— Vod Kanockers (@JHoward2716) February 15, 2019Kevin Durant can now switch teams mid game with these new #NBA jerseys 😳 pic.twitter.com/a01rMkiexr— OT Sports Podcast Network (@OTSportsPod) February 15, 2019This could go one of two ways: Either the NBA will have found another way to separate itself from the other sports leagues or it will be a pointless feature that exists just because there is the technology to make it happen and for Twitter to crack jokes. In any case, you have to admit the NBA never fails to entertain.More from Yahoo Sports: • Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight When spring training camps opened this week around Major League Baseball, it brought hope that maybe, finally, Bryce Harper and Manny Machado would sign with teams and baseball’s long free-agent freeze would melt away.Nope. Not yet. Not only has that not happened, something else did happen: a number of talented young players around the league have agreed to team-friendly contract extensions.The latest was New York Yankees ace Luis Severino, who on Friday reportedly agreed to a four-year, $40 million deal. The deal, first reported by Joel Sherman of the New York Post, would buy up Severino’s arbitration years and comes with a $15 million club option for his first year of free agency.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]By agreeing to this deal, the Yankees and Severino avoid arbitration for 2019. He’ll make $4 million this season, $10 million next, then $10.25 million in 2021 and $11 million in 2022. The club option is for 2023. In the grand scheme of society, this is a very generous contract. In baseball’s economic bubble, it’s another young player signing for below-market value relative to his skills and potential.It’s hard to blame Severino for taking the deal, looking around at a free-agent world where Harper and Machado are still available, as are Dallas Keuchel and Craig Kimbrel. Especially since we haven’t heard even slight grumblings about teams being interested in Keuchel and Kimbrel.Coming off a breakout season in which he went 19-8 with a 3.39 ERA, the 25-year-old Severino was given a deal that’s pretty hard to turn down: “Do you want $40 million guaranteed, yes or no?”The other players faced with a similar question this week were Philadelphia Phillies ace Aaron Nola, who said yes to a four-year, $45 million deal Wednesday. It also avoided arbitration and bought out two of Nola’s free agency years, making it the most below-market deal of any of these.The Minnesota Twins locked up two of their talented young players Thursday, as right fielder Max Kepler agreed to a five-year, $35 million deal with a $10 million club option for 2024. It buys out three years of free agency for Kepler, 26. Shortstop Jorge Polanco also agreed to a five-year extension, his is worth $25.75 million with two option years that could keep him in Minnesota through 2025.In a vacuum, these types of extensions look like win-wins: The players get guaranteed money as they’re coming off good seasons. The clubs get cost-certainty to help them navigate the future — whether it’s the Yankees and Phillies trying to add big free agents this year or next, or a team like the Twins striving for contention with a homegrown core.In a bigger sense, though, it’s hard not to look at these deals in the current state of free agency and wonder if they’re a symptom of something else. Is it the market correcting itself? Is it baseball’s economy morphing into something new? Or maybe it’s just players looking around and saying, “Well, I better get my money now.”According to numerous reports, there’s a fear that for this generation of young players the light at the end of the tunnel — the big free-agency payday — won’t be there for them in the same way it was for so many other players.So while it’s great that stars like Justin Verlander, Clayton Kershaw and Max Scherzer are publicly speaking out about the current state of free agency, they’re on the right side of it. They got their mega deals.The younger players find themselves in a different sort of peril. It’s entirely possible that these are the biggest paydays these players ever get, which is a much different economic model that we’ve seen from baseball in the past.Whether it’s right or wrong — and that’s certainly something that’s up for debate heading into the next collective-bargaining agreement — baseball’s economy has often been backward. Players get paid less, relative to the market, in their pre-free agency years. The best recent example is Mike Trout winning the MVP in 2014 at age 22 while making $1 million.He got a raise to $6 million the next season, but in 2015 was still making a fraction of what people like Ryan Howard ($25M), Albert Pujols ($24M), Joe Mauer ($23M), Mark Teixeira ($22.5M) and Jose Reyes ($22M) were making.But that overpay is a necessary part baseball’s economic ecosystem too. It’s a fact: Players get overpaid as their careers decline. It’s almost like baseball’s way of making up for underpaying players during their early years. It’s baseball’s golden parachute. What’s happening these days is fewer teams are accepting that overpay as part of the how the system works.In the past few years, arbitration salaries have gotten higher and higher, and teams have tried harder to lock up younger stars before free agency. It’s why we’ve see players like Madison Bumgarner, Chris Archer, Chris Sale and Paul Goldschmidt become valuable trade chips for their team-friendly contract extensions.Teams are getting smarter about where their money goes, and how to keep value in their assets. These extensions to Severino, Nola and the rest show that they’re willing to spend money, just in the way that they want.Earlier this week, former Miami Marlins president David Samson tweeted something in response to Justin Verlander, saying the “broken system” talk was wrong. Players and their agents, Samson said, needed to adjust to a “new reality.”He may be right about the new reality part. The monster paydays at the end of the free agency tunnel could be fading away. If Bryce Harper and Manny Machado can’t get them, who can?The new reality could be players seizing their money. Whenever they can.– – – – – –Mike Oz is a writer at Yahoo Sports.

However, Wainwright framed the situation with a little more urgency on Friday by expressing concerns that a day of reckoning could happen sooner than later.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]Speaking to InsideSTL.com’s Tim McKernan, Wainwright said it was inevitable that the players will go on strike unless major changes are made to help bridge the widening gap. But he’s also worried that frustrations could reach a boiling point during the season leading to some form of a revolt. Perhaps even a mid-season walkout.#STLCards pitcher Adam Wainwright on @TMASTL: “Unless something changes, there’s going to be a strike. 100%. I’m just worried people are going to walk-out mid-season.” pic.twitter.com/M8WeRVcASe— Tim McKernan (@tmckernan) February 15, 2019“Unless something changes, there’s going to be a strike. 100%,” Wainwright said regarding the free-agent freeze that has left stars like Bryce Harper and Manny Machado without contracts. “I’m just worried people are going to walkout midseason.”It’s conceivable given the current climate, but a players revolt on that level still feels like a long shot. The target date we should all still be looking at is Dec. 1, 2021. That’s when the current collective bargaining agreement ends and the owners will be forced to come to the table.That doesn’t mean we should just dismiss Wainwright’s concerns about a 2019 strike. While they might feel a little on the dramatic side, the frustration that has built all offseason as dozens of free agents, including and especially Harper and Machado, remain unsigned is becoming more palpable by the day. There’s a genuine feeling that owners are determined to cut back on salaries even as profits continue to reach new heights, it’s possible the players’ patience will run out if the free-agent freeze continues to drag on. Wainwright thinks so, and he’s far from alone.In Friday’s interview, the 37-year-old right-hander also criticized owners and front offense personnel for placing too much emphasis on “analytics” and placing everything in a “sabermetric box” that discounts intangibles and other immeasurable aspects of baseball.Adam Wainwright said today on ⁦@TMASTL⁩ that he expects there to be a strike “100%.”The context of the conversation comes from a discussion on how Bryce Harper and Manny Machado are still without teams.You can see Wainwright’s reasoning in the video below. pic.twitter.com/GXsmx4cXk1— Tim McKernan (@tmckernan) February 15, 2019Wainwright admitted that there’s always risk in making long-term financial commitments to players, but emphasized that doing so marks a commitment to winning that several teams seemingly lack.“Part of it is smart from their side of it, but you have to realize it’s about winning. So, if Bryce Harper wants 10 years and he’s 26 years old. He’s going to be a dynamic player. The same can be said about Manny Machado. These guys are superstar players.”The deeper we get into it the more obvious it is that the players know what battles lie ahead. The only real question is how much worse it will get before any progress is made toward a satisfactory resolution.More from Yahoo Sports:• Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight MLB rumors: Bryce Harper has made his decision, says D.C. radio host originally appeared on nbcsportsbayarea.comA report has come out from the East Coast saying Bryce Harper has come to a decision on which team he will play for in 2019 and beyond.Chris Russell, a sports radio talk show host from 106.7 The Fan in Washington D.C., (who has been on the Harper beat for some time) said the free agent slugger could make a decision in the next 24 hours.\"Maybe I took a little bit of a leap of faith here based on some indications I got from a real good source,\" Russell told 94WIP, in Philadelphia, on Friday.\"Bryce and his representatives, (Scott) Boras, his people, his wife Kayla, they've been meeting since Monday morning in Vegas. Bryce originally wanted this done, when it took this long, by Valentine's Day. Obviously, the contract has not been announced, signed, or whatever.\"\"But I'm led to believe by the people that I've talked to that are close to the situation -- and I have, again, a real good source that has helped me through this process, let's just leave it at that,\" Russell said. \"That Bryce was in a mood to celebrate yesterday. Now, the source said, 'I believe it's done.' I don't have concrete, 100 percent proof for you guys. I wish I did, otherwise, I would have it and I would be running around with it. But I don't have that, so I want to caution everybody in Philadelphia. But that's what I was led to believe, that this thing is now decided.\"Russell then mentioned the Phillies.\"Now, what comes then is hammering out a contract. And if we were to believe the report that the Philadelphia Phillies had not even extended a formal offer -- and I assume that to be a termed, written agreement, that type of thing, which I find hard to believe -- then there might be more legwork to this. And therefore, hey the decision may be done, but the contract still needs to be ironed out.\"[RELATED: Phillies fan participates in \"lent\" in hopes of recruiting Harper]Russell is being safe with the terminology he's using, which is understandable. And while we haven't been able to confirm these rumors, Harper, along with many other free agents, remains unsigned.The Giants appeared to be the \"mystery team\" that introduced themselves late into the Harper sweepstakes -- and when the radio hosts asked Russell his opinion on where the outfielder will end up next season, he believed Harper will be in an orange and black uniform.\"I don't think it's going to be the Nationals,\" Russell said. \"I think it's going to be the San Francisco Giants, but that is not by any means an 'I know that for a fact,' so I want to caution everybody -- I know how this works -- I get in trouble with everything I say on my radio show, and everyone blows it up.\" The wait continues ... Golden State Warriors stars Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant empathised with Steve Kerr after the head coach was ejected during the loss to the Portland Trail Blazers having thrown a clipboard in response to a flagrant foul call.Kerr was enraged late in the fourth quarter when Draymond Green was called for a flagrant foul after he stopped Zach Collins from approaching the rim as he went up for a shot.That drew Kerr's ire and after ranting in one referee's face, he slammed a clipboard down to earn an ejection, with Durant having to escort his head coach back off the court.The Warriors lost the game 129-107 but will still head into the All-Star break with the best record in the Western Conference.\"It was an emotional game. We fought really hard for 43 minutes,\" Curry told reporters afterwards.\"One questionable decision - the flagrant - obviously the fire came out. You see coach go and throw a clipboard. At that point you try to get us over the hump. An eight-point swing, it's tough to overcome.\"\"I looked at the replay and the amount of ball [Green] got, there was nothing excessive about it, he got all the ball.\"There was a lot of chirping, with Zach involved. There was probably a sensitivity to it, trying to put out some fires, but I thought it was a terrible call. We obviously paid the price for it with how everything unfolded after that.\"Durant shared that sympathy having been the one to pull Kerr away from the referees as he continued to rant at them.\"I felt for him, I understand his anger and his rage, especially for that call,\" he said.\"I thought we should have just kept playing, It was a common foul, I thought. Refs looked at it differently. \"I understand why coach was a little frustrated.\"Kerr explained that it was the disbelief at the call that had triggered his reaction.\"I was just shocked that that was called a flagrant foul,\" he said. \"I'm not sure how it's determined - if it's in New York or the officials on the call - but that was head-scratching: that that could be called a flagrant foul.\"The guy's going to go in for a dunk, you've got to make sure he doesn't dunk it.\"So, I told Kenny [Mauer] that I beg to differ. There might have been a couple of other words in there too!\"I'll have to ask the owner if the clipboard broke when I threw it down. I got a little anger out so that was good. I was too busy yelling to ask for an explanation.\"Charles Barkley thinks New Orleans Pelicans star Anthony Davis made a mistake with his trade request.The 25-year-old asked the Pelicans to move him in late January and the Los Angeles Lakers had been engaged in discussions about acquiring him. But, no deal was reached before the deadline and Davis remained with New Orleans.Barkley, an 11-time All-Star who works as an analyst for TNT, said he thinks Davis and his agent, Rich Paul, mishandled the situation.\"Don't ruin your reputation as a great player, one of the nicest guys in the world,\" Barkley told reporters on Thursday ahead of All-Star weekend (via the Washington Post).\"Remember, your agent works for you, you don't work for him. They handled that situation wrong. It's going to come back to bite them in the a***. It's unfortunate.\"The six-time All-Star entered play on Thursday averaging 28.5 points and 13.1 rebounds this season. But, he scored just three points in 24 minutes on the floor in the Pelicans' 118-88 loss to the Orlando Magic earlier this week.\"This is a bad situation,\" Barkley said. \"It's a bad look for the NBA. Because that kid can't go out there and give 100 per cent because he’s worried about getting hurt. The guy's the second-best player in the world and he's got three points? That's not a good look for the NBA.\"The Boston Celtics and New York Knicks, among others, are expected to explore dealing for Davis after the season. Barkley, however, said he believes the forward will eventually land in Los Angeles because of Paul's relationship with Lakers star LeBron James.Barkley tallied 22.1 points and 11.7 rebounds per game over his 16-year career. He retired in 2000 and was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame six years later.After an apology from Sergio Garcia, a non-apology from Matt Kuchar, and an uncooperative Mother Nature on Valentine's Day, it's time for everyone to focus again on Tiger Woods. Kidding. Sort of. A weather-delayed first round at Riviera re-starts on Friday morning and the 14-time major champ will be in the Hollywood-area spotlight as he finally begins his Genesis Open. And golf fans could potentially see a LOT of the tournament host as the event tries to play catch up after heavy rains on Thursday.Woods, Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas (Decent group, eh?) are scheduled to tee off at 8:32 local time (11:32 ET). The hope is they will complete their first rounds and then play as much of their second rounds as possible before darkness. And Tiger's hope is to finally win for the first time at this historic layout where he missed the cut last year. We'll be tracking Tiger every step of the way so keep it right here for the latest scores, news and highlights. (All times eastern)SATURDAY, 11:25: With a 25-foot birdie putt on No. 9, Woods' final hole of the second round, Tiger will likely make the cut. The birdie brought Woods back to even on his round and to one under overall.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096808527694245890After resuming play in the morning, Woods bogeyed his first hole, No. 4, then made four pars before his finishing birdie. His playing partners, however, fared much better. Justin Thomas shares the lead with Adam Scott at 11 under and Rory McIlroy birdied four of his six holes on Saturday morning to shoot 63 and move to seven under through 36 holes. Thursday's early wave is now on the course for their second rounds.-------------------FRIDAY-------------------8:25: And with that, the horn has sounded—play will be suspended for darkness on Friday at Riviera. Tiger, JT and Rory have six more holes to complete their second round. Justin Thomas is at 10-under, tied with Adam Scott for the lead. Tiger will hope Saturday brings some different momentum for him—as this marathon day ends with two bogeys in a row after the highlight eagle.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10965708926692065298:21: That's back-to-back bogeys now for Tiger Woods, dropping another shot here at the third hole (his 12th of the round). And over his past six holes, Tiger has four bogeys. The birdie at No. 1 helped negate most of that damage ... but Tiger's back to 1-under again—right on the current cut line.8:13: On his 30th hole of the day, Tiger is showing some obvious signs of being tired. And who could blame him—he's been playing golf for nearly 10 hours straight. From 165 yards out at the third hole, Tiger Woods tries to chop out a 6-iron and comes out of it. His ball comes to rest short of the green. With sunset in Pacific Palisades being 5:30 local time, this group will have time for maybe one more hole today.8:04: Tiger follows up that eagle putt at No. 1 with a bogey at the second hole. The third bogey of his second round moves Tiger back to 2-under overall.7:56: After a long wait at the second hole, Tiger sprays his second shot from 235 out with a fairway wood out to the right. He'll have his work cut out from the front right bunker to save par at the 482-yard par 4.7:40: This is exactly what Tiger Woods needed: He rolls in his 43-foot eagle putt at his 10th hole (the first) to get back to 3-under—negating those two bogeys he made on his front nine. What a putt! With the flagstick in!https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096570892669206529Tiger made a disappointing par to open his first round earlier today at the first hole. The unlikely eagle makes up for that effort—and could turn around Tiger's second round in a dramatic way. Tiger goes from toeing the cut line at 1-under to now all of a sudden being T-21.7:28: Tiger finds the fairway at the par-5 first hole, the group's 10th hole of their second round, as he attempts to get a shot back here after bogeying two of his final three holes on his front nine. Neither bogey was particularly bad—the 18th hole is playing brutally tough right now uphill and into the wind with the rain, making it even more of a challenging hole. And his break at 16 was very unlucky.7:16: Tiger and JT are gonna have their work cut out to save par at the 18th hole (their ninth). Each player had fairway wood approaches and tried playing a big cut. JT was way up left on the hill—Tiger was closer. He went high with his approach and will have about 11 feet left for par.Tiger misses the par putt, so he'll drop a shot along with JT as they make the turn. Tiger moves back to 1-under after 27 holes. That's where the cut line currently is—so all of a sudden, Tiger must be concerned about making the cut.7:01: Following Justin Thomas throwing a dart at the 17th to about 3 feet, Tiger puts his wedge shot from under 100 yards to outside 20 feet, so he'll be disappointed with that effort. The birdie putt misses on the high side, and Tiger taps in for par to remain at 2-under. His playing partner and buddy Justin Thomas stays hot, rolling in a fourth straight birdie to get to 9-under—tied for the lead with Adam Scott. Really impressive golf here from JT.6:54: The rain is really coming down now as the players head to the 17th hole. Tiger finds the fairway at the par-5 17th hole, but it was a short one—he has 326 yards left. Most players have been laying up at this par 5 all day.6:43: From a brutal position up against the back lip of the bunker, Tiger hacks it out—and somehow keeps the ball on the green, albeit the back portion. His par attempt from 44 feet away here comes up three feet shy. Tiger makes his bogey to move back to 2-under.Meanwhile, Justin Thomas is officially on fire. He has another birdie after a fabulous tee shot at 16. It's now two Kentucky boys tied at the top: Justin Thomas and J.B. Holmes (-8).https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10965576791939317766:39: Tiger will have serious lie issues at the par-3 16th hole. His tee shot came to rest up against the back lip of the bunker. As Billy Kratzert just remarked on PGA Tour Live, Tiger will do well just to keep this ball on the green. Though he avoided dropping a shot on his last hole, there might be a bogey in his future here.6:35: A clutchhh par save by Tiger at the 15th hole makes up for his poor chip—and Tiger keeps the momentum going on his second round, as he stays 3-under for the tournament and 2-under on the round.Justin Thomas, also in Tiger's group, holed out from in front of the green for birdie at the 14th hole, and he makes a long birdie putt at 15 to get to 7-under—just one back of fellow Kentucky native J.B. Holmes.6:32: A poor chip shot from Tiger at the 15th hole leaves him about 13 feet away. He'll need to convert that putt to prevent dropping his first shot of his second round.6:24: Tiger finds another fairway here at Riviera, this one at the 15th hole. The guy is feeeling it with his driver. Almost on auto pilot. His approach from 190 out turns a little too much, finding the rough to the left of the green. He'll have to get up and down to avoid dropping one here.6:20: From 20 feet out, Tiger's birdie bid comes up shy—never really scaring the hole, despite getting a good look at the line from Rory's putt. Tiger taps in for par to remain at 3-under.The putter has been disappointing for Tiger all day: He had 34 putts in his first round, including four three-putts, just the third time in his career he's done that.6:13: Tiger puts his tee shot at the par-3 14th hole just inside Rory's ball—about 20 feet right of the hole. He'll get a little teach from Rory's putt, too, as Tiger continues to hit it well today.6:07: Tiger just misses the left-to-right curling bid for birdie, leaving himself with an easy par at 13. He stays 3-under for the tournament and -2 through four on his round.Tiger's playing partners are also playing well—Rory has three birdies in his first four holes to get to 2-under. Look out for Rory at rainy Riviera. And Justin Thomas, despite hitting his tee shot out of bounds at 13, got up and down from 160 yards to avoid dropping multiple shots. He's now 5-under after that bogey.6:02: Another grooved tee shot for Tiger Woods at the 13th hole puts him in good position. He turned over his tee shot—putting his draw in the middle of the fairway at the dogleg left. Tiger spins his approach back to about 15 feet, just off the green in the fringe. He'll have a chance to knock another one here and keep the momentum going.5:51: Bang! Tiger nails the 25-footer for birdie at the 12th hole to add a second birdie to his card through three holes. Realistically, too, it could be three straight birdies for Tiger. But the 14-time major champion is now 2-under through 3—T-3 for the tournament (T-19)—and carries some strong momentum on his side at the start of his second round ... as the rain is coming down at Riviera.5:46: Tiger hits his approach hole high—about 25 feet from 181 yards. He'll have another chance to add a birdie to his third round.Tiger's currently at 2-under, which puts him at T-29. The projected cut is at 1-under—so he's comfortably inside the number as of now. But there's a ton of golf to be played, obviously.5:41: Tiger finds the fairway with his driver at the par-4 12th hole. The 12th usually plays as one of the toughest holes at Riviera—we'll see if Tiger can take advantage of his position here in the fairway.5:33: An excellent fairway-wood second shot by Tiger put him right in front of the par-5 11th green in two. But a very poor approach putt for his third leaves him more than 10 feet away. His birdie try slides by for a very disappointing par being so close in 2. That should've been a golden opportunity to start his second round with two birdies—instead, Tiger stays at 2-under.5:12: Tiger goes high with his pitch—having to navigate around the front bunker, and plays it nicely—spinning it about 7 feet short of the hole. So Tiger will have a good look for an opening birdie to start his second round. Tiger converts the birdie putt to move to 2-under.5:02: Only a little more than a half hour after finishing his first round, Tiger Woods (-1) -- along with Justin Thomas (-5) and Rory McIlroy (+1) -- has teed off in his second round. The group started on the drivable 10th hole, and Tiger has driven his tee shot just off the green. He'll have a chance to put his pitch shot close to start his second round with a birdie.4:24: Tiger narrowly misses the birdie putt at the 18th hole, so he'll tap in for a par and an opening-round, one-under 70 at Riviera. Having three-putted for a fourth time on the 17th hole to drop a shot in disappointing fashion, Tiger will head to his second round a bit frustrated. But the four consecutive birdies showed him being able to score well at Riviera, where he has never won.Tiger, JT (who birdied 18 to finish at 5-under) and Rory will head right back for their second round in this marathon day for them.4:18: Tiger responds to that shocking three-putt with a perfect drive and a towering 6-iron on Riviera's famed 18th. Woods is in good shape to at least make par the difficult hole, but as we've seen all day, a two-putt is anything but automatic.Here's an unusual stat on Tiger three-putting four times this afternoon. He's making some history in a bad way...https://twitter.com/JustinRayGolf/status/10965196250582507574:06: So much for the momentum. . . After a decent approach shot that spins back to about 20 feet, Woods runs his birdie putt a couple feet by and. . . gulp. . . misses the comebacker from about two feet. Wow. That's four three-putts on the day as Tiger falls back to one under with one hole to play.3:57: Uh-oh, it's raining in southern California again. Meanwhile, Woods is plodding his way up the par-5 17th. After pulling his drive into the left rough and drawing a poor lie, Woods pushed his layup slightly into the first cut of the right rough. He'll have a some sort of wedge to a back-right hole location.3:50: Tiger's tee shot was tracking on the par-3 16th, but it comes up about 30 feet short. From there, he two-putts for par to remain at two under. Justin Thomas makes his 10-foot birdie effort to move to four under, while Rory McIlroy remains at one over. McIlroy hast two holes to avert his first over-par score of 2019.3:40: After another great drive and a solid approach, Woods races his birdie attempt nearly five feet past the hole. But he keeps the overall positive momentum going by converting the par putt to remain at two under. Tiger has three more holes to play. At least, before he gets a lunch break.3:24: BANG! There's the bounce back from Tiger. It just came one hole later. And from farther away as Woods drains his 12-footer for birdie on No. 14.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096507996031467520Woods is now back to two under, five shots behind Jordan Spieth, who has to be pleased to still be in front by two despite these soft conditions.3:17: Tiger hits a great shot on the difficult par-3 14th hole to about 15 feet. He'll have a good look at birdie coming up. In the meantime, here's a look at how the leader board stands with Jordan Spieth still leading the way.Jordan Spieth (-7) 2t. Tony Finau (-5) 2t. Patrick Rodgers (-5) 2t. Kramer Hickok (-5) 2t. Davis Love III (-5) 2t. Adam Scott (-5) 2t. J.B. Homes (-5)Click here for full scores.3:13: Woods stuck his approach to about four feet below the hole on No. 13. A bounce back birdie looked like a forgone conclusion until he pushed his effort. Woof. That's two three-putts and two short misses on the greens for Tiger today. He remains at one under. Meanwhile, Rory McIlroy, after getting to two under through eight, has fallen to one over after back-to-back bogeys. Justin Thomas, the third player in the group, continues to lead this trio at three under.3:05: After hitting fade after fade, Woods steps to the 13th tee and rips a draw around the corner, perfectly setting up his next shot. Good to see him working it both ways with ease.3:01: Tiger pushed his tee shot into the right rough, then hit a fantastic recovery shot from a thick lie onto the green. He had a long look at birdie that rolled about four feet past, leaving him with a tricky left-to-right par putt, which he missed. That's three three putts on the day for Woods, and he's still one under.2:39: Not the best chip from Woods, as he left himself about six feet for birdie, but he makes it anyway. Four straight for Tiger to get to two under for the day.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10964952191957975042:30: Woods rips a 3-wood from 269 to just in front of the green. Hate to jinx him, but there's no reason he shouldn't easily make his fourth straight birdie here (ducks).2:20: Three in a row for Woods as he rolls in another at No. 10 and moves to one under. If he finds the fairway again at the 11th, four in a row will be in his sights. Meanwhile, Rory makes his par to stay at one under and JT ends up holing his 10 footer for birdie to get to four under. Finally a little bit of JUICE from this threesome.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096489287753711616https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096489787672780800By the way, it looks like we know when they'll be heading back out for round two later today. Here's an update from the Tiger Tracker:https://twitter.com/GCTigerTracker/status/1096481806067523585That should give them enough time to get at least 11 or 12 holes in.At the 11th, Woods stripes another drive down the fairway. He's really starting to cook.2:12: Tiger's shot was a tad more difficult than we thought, as he had to avoid a bunker and take it up high to get it back to the pin. He was successful, sticking it to about three feet. Hell of a shot. Even better was Rory's shot, as he flopped it from a nice lie and got it to hang on just off the back of the green and stay out of the back bunker. Thomas, who had the easiest shot, put too much spin on his chip, leaving himself with about 10 feet for birdie.2:07: Finally, Tiger, Rory and JT hit their tee shots, and it looks like the ensuing entertainment will be well worth the wait. Tiger is in the collection area left of the green, where he has a straightforward chip that should set him up with a good chance to make birdie. Thomas is just in front of the green, and he'll have a great chance to make a birdie as well. Rory ... um ... not so much. He's in the rough with a greenside bunker in front of him and a pin he won't be able to get close to, and just holding the green would be a miracle.1:52: Woods drains his four-footer for bird and turns in even par 35. Real strong finish to his opening nine, and now it looks like he'll have a long wait at the 10th. DeChambeau, Kuchar and Rahm have still yet to hit their tee shots.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10964831254067896321:47: Tiger had just 122 left to the green and stuck one in there close. He has four feet left for birdie to turn in even par, which would be a small victory after that ugly three putt back at No. 7. Not to mention he'll have a prime opportunity to get into red figures at the driveable par-4 10th.1:41: Woods cranks another high fade right down the middle with the driver at No. 9. With the tees up today, he'll have a low iron in his hand for his approach.1:34: And he's on the board! Woods bounces back with a birdie putt from 15 feet, getting him back to one over. We'll see if that gets him going before making the turn.1:30: From 125 yards out, Woods hit a wedge and hated it from the second he made contact. While he did pull it, he's still hole high and inside 20 feet. Hideki Matsuyama-esque move from Tiger.1:24: Woods rips one right down the middle at the par-4 eighth. Should have a short iron in.1:15: Tiger's birdie putt was actually from just off the green on the fringe, and he rolled it by some four feet. Then, he missed the comebacker for par, dropping to two over on the day. Oof.1:09: Fairway and a green for Woods at the seventh. Good look at birdie coming up to get back to level par.12:58: Another hole, another par for Woods, who two-putted from 24 feet on the par-3 sixth. In the group up ahead, though, Jon Rahm is making a move at three under through six.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/109646557828021452912:47: Another meh hole for Tiger on No. 5, just missing the fairway with his tee shot, finding the front of the green with a so-so approach, and two-putting for another par from 43 feet. Woods remains at one over through five holes while his playing partners, McIlroy and Thomas, both remain at one under.12:42: As Matt Kuchar's ball is in the air on the par-3 sixth, a fan yells, \"Go low—just not with the gratuity!\" Despite Matt maintaining this is \"not a story,\" it is. And this won't be the last comment like this.12:29: Woods hit a nice shot to about 15 feet on the par-3 fourth, but ran his birdie effort by the hole. Still one over. Still no highlights. At least, from Tiger. Here was Spieth's closing birdie from about an hour ago, because there is not much else exciting going on right now.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/109644546143346688112:17: Another missed fairway and another short approach from Tiger on the par-4 third. Although, Woods found the putting surface, he was unable to two-putt from 63 feet, missing a seven-footer for par after badly misreading his first putt. That drops Tiger to one over through three holes. Not a lot of highlights so far. . .12:02: Tiger misses right off the tee on No. 2 then comes up short on another approach. But his pitch shot nearly goes down, leaving him with a tap-in par. Even par through two holes.11:49: After that perfect opening tee shot, Tiger hit a hideous approach with a 5-iron that came up way short in a fairway bunker. From there, he hit his third to 10 feet but missed the putt to walk away with a disappointing par. Both of Tiger's playing partners, McIlroy and Thomas, make birdie.11:38: Matt Kuchar just misses his eagle attempt from 25 feet on No. 1, but taps in for birdie. Kuchar has been in the news a lot this week over a caddie controversy dating back to his win at the Mayakoba Golf Classic. A controversy he didn't help with his comments on Wednesday. Is it possible some of those \"Kuuuuch\" shouts will turn to \"Mooooch\"? Kinda sounded like it on the first hole. . .11:34: Jordan Spieth is in with a seven-under-par 64 to take the early lead. Spieth needed only 21 putts during his bogey-free round. Of course, starting tournaments hasn't been a problem for Spieth of late. Finishing, however, has been a different story. Incredibly, Spieth is looking for his first win since the 2017 British Open and his first top 5 since last year's Masters.11:32: Woods smashes a driver off the first tee that finds the fairway. The opening par 5 at Riviera is essentially a long par 4 and one of the easiest holes on the PGA Tour all year so Tiger is thinking at least birdie after that tee shot.10:53: So far, so good on the Friday weather:https://twitter.com/GCTigerTracker/status/1096437235262533632And with lift, clean and place in play (for at least the first round), low scores are out there. Let's set the over/under on the Par-71 layout at 68.5.10:45: We are approximately 45 minutes away from Tiger's tee time and it's another major champ who is already off to a fantastic start. Jordan Spieth has the lead at six under through 15 holes. Spieth leads Patrick Rodgers by one and then there's a big group at four under, including Bill Haas, who is playing in the event a year after being involved in a car accident during last year's tournament that killed a friend he was staying with. Make sure you read Brian Wacker's piece from earlier in the week on how Haas is still trying to move on from that tragedy.10:35: As we move within an hour from Tiger teeing off, check out GOLFTV's latest behind-the-scenes video with Woods in which he says his bag has up to 16(!) golf gloves during rainy rounds and he explains why he doesn't like wearing rain jackets:https://twitter.com/GOLFTV/status/1096246456795697153\"Pops used to say, 'Once you're wet, you're wet.

Once he started running the front office, his blinking at Paul George on national TV contributed to the Lakers getting fined again for tampering.

But anybody else do it, they don’t get fined. So I’m going to stay away from that one.I don’t blame Johnson for feeling that way.Other teams’ owners, coaches and executives have repeatedly publicly discussed rival players without facing announced punishment.To be fair, the NBA doesn’t reveal every fine. Bucks owner Marc Lasry reportedly just got fined for tampering, but the league never announced it. But, at minimum, there’s an inconsistency with how the NBA exposes Johnson’s transgressions.Even NBA commissioner Adam Silver said last year there’s a spotlight on the Lakers due to prior tampering. That strikes me as unfair. The Lakers already paid for their prior violations and should now be held to the same standard as everyone else.And for what it’s worth, I wish that standard allowed an all-time great point guard like Johnson to publicly share his thoughts on Kemba Walker.Gareth Bale has landed himself in hot water after La Liga denounced the Real Madrid star for his celebration in the Madrid derby, which could carry a ban of four to 12 games.The Welsh forward scored as a substitute in the 3-1 victory over Atletico Madrid, bringing up his 100th goal for the club.And during the celebrations that followed, Bale \"lifted his right arm near his head in a clear sign of provocation towards the fans, then giving a gesture which could be seen as obscene and disdainful by folding his arm and striking it with his other hand.\"In a statement released by La Liga, Bale’s punishment will be decided by whether he incited the crowd or not.If Bale is guilty of “inciting opposition fans” to cause a hostile reaction, the punishment could carry four to 12 games, if there was no hostile reaction but intent, then it could be as little as one to three games.The gesture is referred to in Spain as ‘corte de mangas,’ with the moment not picked up in the referee’s match report.A committee will now decide whether the gesture merits a punishment.Bale also featured in Real’s Champions League victory over Ajax.Los Blancos take a 2-1 lead back to the Bernabeu for the second leg of the last 16 tie after Marco Asensio’s late winner.Earlier this week Heisman Trophy winner — and first round draft pick of the Oakland Athletics — Kyler Murray chose football over baseball, committing himself to the NFL draft. It was a move that, however sensible from Murray’s point of view, has led to a lot of soul-searching among baseball folks and has raised questions about what the sport offers young, talented athletes with other options.It’s not that bleak, however! Another outstanding college football player said no to football this week and reaffirmed his commitment to baseball. Tim Tebow! From PFT:One Florida Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback will not be coaching another in the Alliance of American Football.Steve Spurrier, the Florida Heisman winner who later coached the Gators to a national championship and is now head coach of the AAF’s Orlando Apollos, said this morning on PFT Live that after the AAF briefly reached out to Tebow in the ball, it became clear that Tebow’s focus is on playing baseball.Ok, so maybe Tebow is not turning down quite the football opportunity that Murray would’ve been. But take your victories where you can get them, baseball.Follow @craigcalcaterraPhil Mickelson is on an all-time heater in the early portion of the 2019 season. In the last month alone he's won his 44th PGA Tour event, finished second in another, hit every fairway in a round for the first time in 21 years, shot a 60, pulled off this impossible recovery shot, gone viral just by rolling his eyes and said he might drop the Players from his schedule because he's already won it (a literal mic drop). The man simply cannot be stopped right now.Leave it to the weather to literally rain on Lefty's parade. On Thursday at the Genesis Open, Mickelson began his first round at the difficult short par-4 10th and drove into one of the bunkers up near the green, leaving him with a dreaded lengthy sand shot. He wound up hitting it over the green, and his ball plugged in the back bunker, setting up an even harder shot than he just had. As you'll hear PGA Tour Live commentator Shane Bacon say, avoiding making a six was probably the goal, but after Mickelson hit his third into another bunker on the other side of the green, a six suddenly became best-case scenario. How does a four sound instead?https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096076528142626818Find us a more Phil Mickelson par ever... you can't. He's always got a flair for the dramatic. The problem? It's not going to count, as the tour wiped scores from the first 30 minutes of play due to the weather, thus making this the greatest par that never counted. It still counts in his mind though:https://twitter.com/PhilMickelson/status/1096106399958937605Peak Phil.RELATED: Where does Phil Mickelson rank among the greatest OMGs? (Old man golfers)The dust is barely settled in the wake of the end of the Markelle Fultz era in Philadelphia, and the former 76ers guard is already taking shots at his old team.His old coach Brett Brown in particular.Fultz had his introductory press conference with the Orlando Magic on Thursday after being traded at last week’s deadline and praised his new coach Steve Clifford while taking a veiled shot at Brown.“It just excites me to know that I have a coach that’s going to push you to be better and not just going to tell you what you want to hear,” Fultz said.That’s direct praise for his new coach. But the message for Brown is clear. Fultz didn’t like what he heard from the Philadelphia coaching staff.Fultz never had any public dispute with the 76ers, but it was evident that he and the team had different approaches to the struggles that saw him shoot 41.4 percent from the field, 26.7 percent from 3-point distance and 53.4 percent from the line in limited action after being selected as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2017 draft.It’s still not clear whether injury or a mental block – or both – are the cause of his shooting issues.After his agent announced that the nerve disorder thoracic outlet syndrome was the root of the shooting woes, Fultz never played again for the 76ers.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]Fultz appears to be fully embracing the fresh start in Orlando as a player and a person.“I think the biggest thing we talked about what doing thing the right way,” Fultz said. “Just building me up both as a man and on the court. I think that’s music to my ears, really just. Two things I really want to do is be the best player I can be and be the best young man I can be.”Fultz described the experience of his nerve disorder to reporters.“It’s hard to lift up your arms, you lose feeling in your fingers,” Fultz said. “You can’t tell when it’s going to happen. It’s not like you do the same motion every time. You get tingling in your fingers, numbness. Stuff like that.”He also curtly dismissed any notion that his shooting struggles are due to anything but injury.“I had an injury,” Fultz said. “I was out there trying to play through that. I never lost confidence.”Asked about a timetable to return, Fultz dodged the question to talk about rehab.“Right now it’s just about getting everything the right way,” he said. “Rehab’s been going great. I’m just taking my time and doing everything the right way.”More from Yahoo Sports: • PGA Tour pro defends paying caddie $5K on $1.3M win • NFL bars NCAA’s all-time sack leader from combine • Only one NBA team failed to scout Antetokounmpo • Black History honor for Kaepernick sacked by lawmakers He might not be well known to NFL fans at large, but New England Patriots fans know linebacker Kyle Van Noy — acquired basically for free from the Detroit Lions at the 2016 trade deadline — has been a big part of the defense the last two years, and has a knack for making plays at the right time.Van Noy is getting a little shine after winning his second Super Bowl ring with New England, appearing on the “Pardon My Take” podcast on Thursday to dish on all things Patriots and Super Bowl LIII.One thing that Van Noy revealed: the Los Angeles Rams didn’t do anything surprising during the game on offense.“I couldn’t believe that,” Van Noy said. “They really didn’t do — not one wrinkle. I was like, ‘What the hell?’ They’ve got so many good players, they’ve got so many things they’ve done all year, and the one play they gave us which was a wrinkle was the [Brandin] Cooks screen that hit for a little bit.“And that was it… Or maybe too, we were playing so good they were like, ‘[Expletive], we don’t know what to do.’ ”Hindsight, of course, is 20-20, but given that the Patriots’ coaching staff is known for having its players prepared for any and everything, it seems unwise that Los Angeles didn’t add some new plays or looks to try to stump New England.Van Noy said the Patriots’ culture, specifically coach Bill Belichick’s practice of not sparing anyone in the film room, even Tom Brady, is part of why the team continues to win.“Oh yeah. Yeah, that [stuff is] sick, to be honest, because it sets the table,” Van Noy said. “Like, OK, it doesn’t matter who you are, everyone’s on an even playing field. This is how it is here at work. You come in and you earn everything.“And I respect that because I felt like that gave me a chance to get on the field when I came in mid-year, and [Belichick] was like, ‘It doesn’t matter who you are or what you’ve done. You earn your keep.’ ”More from Yahoo Sports: • Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight The Brady Conundrum: How do you go about replacing the GOAT? originally appeared on nbcsportsboston.comThe Patriots hatched a Tom Brady succession plan after the 2013 season when they drafted Jimmy Garoppolo.Brady blew that up.Now, five years, four Super Bowl appearances, three Super Bowl wins, two Super Bowl MVPs and a regular-season MVP later, it's time to gingerly -- caaaauuuuuutiooooousssssllllyyyyy -- begin the process again.This time should be different.Even though Brady's contract hasn't been extended past the 2019 season, the love and happiness we saw on the field after the Rams were dispatched in SB53 is a good sign.MORE PATRIOTSAreas of Change: Will Pats be able to retain free agents Trey Flowers and Trent Brown?Brady's wariness about the Patriots' plans for him, and Bill Belichick's wariness about wedding his team to a quarterback who's closer to 50 years old than he is to 30, has dissipated.Once a new deal is in place -- Jonathan Kraft indicated that might be before training camp, though as of the Super Bowl conversations hadn't started -- Brady will have a written assurance that he will leave the Patriots and the NFL on his terms.That wasn't the case in early 2014 when the soon-to-be-37-year-old Brady saw the Patriots spend a first-round pick on a defensive tackle (Dominique Easley) and their second-rounder on Garoppolo. That, after a '13 season Brady spent throwing to the likes of Aaron Dobson, Josh Boyce, Kenbrell Thompkins and Austin Collie.Garoppolo was a stick of dynamite under Brady's behind. He was the existential threat Brady feared made flesh.Jimmy might have thought he was drafted to learn how to play quarterback in the NFL and have a nice career. To Brady, Garoppolo was there to take his job, throw his career into upheaval, uproot his family and see Brady cast out into the NFL wilderness.MORE PATRIOTSPerry: If Beckham is on the trade block, should Patriots be willing to pay the price?And, in contrast to the guy Brady succeeded in 2001 (and, by extension, did all those things to), Brady wasn't going to snort derisively at the plucky little draft pick here to take his job. He would crush the threat.He did.Brady played so well that -- despite Garoppolo developing into a bona-fide front-line quarterback under Belichick and Josh McDaniels (and Brady) -- Brady left the ever-prepared Patriots with no recourse when Garoppolo's contract was about to expire.Brady was too good to bench and too important to trade. Garoppolo was too expensive to franchise and too smart to take a \"bridge\" contract so he could watch Brady from the sidelines while his own hair started to gray at the temples. So off he went around Halloween, 2017.A lot's happened in the 16 months since.MORE PATRIOTSPhil Perry's Mock Draft 1.0: Pats start looking for Gronk's replacementBut now here we are, in the offseason of Brady's 42nd year. And the complex question of how to find the player who will eventually replace the greatest quarterback in NFL history still lingers.Do you draft his successor? If you do, do you do it this year? Do you do it next year?Do you try to get into the top 10 to get your pick of the litter? Do you stay put, confident that the muttonheads across the league will miss out as they did with Brady and Garoppolo (or Aaron Rodgers, Russell Wilson, Drew Brees, Brett Favre, Johnny Unitas . . . you get the point)? How much will it cost to get into the top 10? Do you package picks from this season -- when you will have six in the first three rounds -- and pick a sucker who will suck next year and fleece them for their 2020 first-rounder? How high do you have to go for a blue-chip, given the number of first-round quarterbacks that will be taken this year and that were taken in 2018?Is it a trade for somebody another team's given up on or has no work for, like San Francisco's Nick Mullens? A veteran who will hit free agency like Nick Foles, Case Keenum or Teddy Bridgewater?How does the successor play the position? Similar to Brady in that brain/eyes/accuracy/commitment trumps legs/arm strength/versatility?MORE PATRIOTSShould Pats be interested in Demaryius Thomas? No . . . and yesOr is there an embrace of the fact that trying to find a quarterback similar to a guy who came into the league after four years at Michigan at the end of last century with a once-in-a-lifetime work ethic is a pipe dream?Aside from who the successor is and how he plays, can Brady -- the lion in winter -- be tapped to help groom whoever is being brought aboard to take over?Brady -- contrary to sexed-up speculation -- didn't actively undermine Garoppolo at any point. They were teammates. He helped Garoppolo play the position better. They became close. But he wasn't quite showing him his world, either. Brady is famous for saying he's not giving away his secrets to younger quarterbacks until after he's done.With the end-date likely to be agreed upon when he signs an extension, does he become more a mentor so that the success of the franchise has a better chance to continue after he leaves? Would the Patriots want him to do that?Or would they want a blank(ish) slate to work with that isn't saying, \"But Tom said . . . \" when they try to shape him to succeed?And that contract? What's it look like? Does Brady demand pay commensurate with what he's accomplished? Is he in the mood to do the team another financial solid given the only bump they have him in 2018 was incentives he never reached? How does that impact the structure of the team?These questions aren't new. What is new is the level of angst and anxiousness. It's dissipated tremendously.That won't make finding his replacement or choosing the means by which the Patriots will do it any easier. But it's less fraught now.The irony is, the Patriots already successfully found Brady's successor. It's just that 2014 was too soon to go looking for him.Now, can they do it again?Click here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!

Before the team's loss to the Blazers on Wednesday night, he told ESPN that he \"wants to finish his career as a Warrior.\"      View this post on Instagram    Klay wants to stay in The Bay.A post shared by  espn (@espn) on Feb 13, 2019 at 9:23pm PSTThompson is set to be an unrestricted free agent at the end of the 2018-19 season.This isn't the first time Klay has made his feelings known. Even his father Mychal, who played five seasons for the Lakers, believes his son will re-sign with the Warriors. [RELATED: For Steve Kerr, Steph Curry and Klay Thompson are mix of NBA past and present]The Warriors selected Thompson with the No. 11 overall pick in the 2011 NBA Draft. Since then, he's been a five-time NBA All-Star, three-time Finals champion and two-time All-NBA selection. Anything could happen, but it's safe to say the Klay and the Dubs have quite the relationship and are ready to tie the knot.Jason Witten never worked with Kellen Moore as a coach, but he did practice with Moore when both of them were still active players with the Cowboys.That experience is enough for Witten to think Moore has “a way about him” that will pay off in his new job as the Cowboys offensive coordinator. Witten said this week that he believes Moore will be innovative and that the offense will take a “big step” by gearing things around quarterback Dak Prescott.“Yeah, I think he will do the things that Dak likes to do,” Witten said, via the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. “He will do the things they have to do to win. That is the way they have to play. I think they will use the pass to set up the run. Not just the run to set up the pass. I think he will add some nice wrinkles to that offense.”With head coach Jason Garrett coaching in the final year of his contract, Moore’s work with the offense will have a lot to do with how Dallas does in 2019 and with the path the team charts in the years that follow. If Witten’s correct, that path will probably look a lot like the one they’ve been on for a while.\n"

Yahoo Sports' Charles Robinson and Amanda Borges address the settlement between the players and the NFL, and what it means for their continuing efforts to promote social activism.The NBA jerseys of the future have a new feature to them: the ability to customize them after purchase by changing the name and number.In an awkward reveal reminiscent of a tech presentation, NBA commissioner Adam Silver and sportscaster Ahmad Rashad demonstrated the jersey at the NBA Tech Summit on Friday ahead of All-Star Weekend in Charlotte, switching a No. 30 Stephen Curry jersey to No. 23 Michael Jordan threads.Adam Silver just revealed the NBA jersey of the future that changes the name and number 🤯(via @NBA)pic.twitter.com/cgJk7KcIIU— Yahoo Sports (@YahooSports) February 15, 2019If Silver is trying to pull a Steve Jobs, perhaps he should stick to his day job. But in all seriousness, the jersey presents some interesting questions: Will it be easier for fans to “bandwagon”? Can players switch jerseys mid-game? Will Drake be first in line for this new prop?Meanwhile, Twitter had all of the jokes.Jersey cost only 20 easy installments of, $999.99.— Vod Kanockers (@JHoward2716) February 15, 2019Kevin Durant can now switch teams mid game with these new #NBA jerseys 😳 pic.twitter.com/a01rMkiexr— OT Sports Podcast Network (@OTSportsPod) February 15, 2019This could go one of two ways: Either the NBA will have found another way to separate itself from the other sports leagues or it will be a pointless feature that exists just because there is the technology to make it happen and for Twitter to crack jokes. In any case, you have to admit the NBA never fails to entertain.More from Yahoo Sports: • Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight When spring training camps opened this week around Major League Baseball, it brought hope that maybe, finally, Bryce Harper and Manny Machado would sign with teams and baseball’s long free-agent freeze would melt away.Nope. Not yet. Not only has that not happened, something else did happen: a number of talented young players around the league have agreed to team-friendly contract extensions.The latest was New York Yankees ace Luis Severino, who on Friday reportedly agreed to a four-year, $40 million deal. The deal, first reported by Joel Sherman of the New York Post, would buy up Severino’s arbitration years and comes with a $15 million club option for his first year of free agency.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]By agreeing to this deal, the Yankees and Severino avoid arbitration for 2019. He’ll make $4 million this season, $10 million next, then $10.25 million in 2021 and $11 million in 2022. The club option is for 2023. In the grand scheme of society, this is a very generous contract. In baseball’s economic bubble, it’s another young player signing for below-market value relative to his skills and potential.It’s hard to blame Severino for taking the deal, looking around at a free-agent world where Harper and Machado are still available, as are Dallas Keuchel and Craig Kimbrel. Especially since we haven’t heard even slight grumblings about teams being interested in Keuchel and Kimbrel.Coming off a breakout season in which he went 19-8 with a 3.39 ERA, the 25-year-old Severino was given a deal that’s pretty hard to turn down: “Do you want $40 million guaranteed, yes or no?”The other players faced with a similar question this week were Philadelphia Phillies ace Aaron Nola, who said yes to a four-year, $45 million deal Wednesday. It also avoided arbitration and bought out two of Nola’s free agency years, making it the most below-market deal of any of these.The Minnesota Twins locked up two of their talented young players Thursday, as right fielder Max Kepler agreed to a five-year, $35 million deal with a $10 million club option for 2024. It buys out three years of free agency for Kepler, 26. Shortstop Jorge Polanco also agreed to a five-year extension, his is worth $25.75 million with two option years that could keep him in Minnesota through 2025.In a vacuum, these types of extensions look like win-wins: The players get guaranteed money as they’re coming off good seasons. The clubs get cost-certainty to help them navigate the future — whether it’s the Yankees and Phillies trying to add big free agents this year or next, or a team like the Twins striving for contention with a homegrown core.In a bigger sense, though, it’s hard not to look at these deals in the current state of free agency and wonder if they’re a symptom of something else. Is it the market correcting itself? Is it baseball’s economy morphing into something new? Or maybe it’s just players looking around and saying, “Well, I better get my money now.”According to numerous reports, there’s a fear that for this generation of young players the light at the end of the tunnel — the big free-agency payday — won’t be there for them in the same way it was for so many other players.So while it’s great that stars like Justin Verlander, Clayton Kershaw and Max Scherzer are publicly speaking out about the current state of free agency, they’re on the right side of it. They got their mega deals.The younger players find themselves in a different sort of peril. It’s entirely possible that these are the biggest paydays these players ever get, which is a much different economic model that we’ve seen from baseball in the past.Whether it’s right or wrong — and that’s certainly something that’s up for debate heading into the next collective-bargaining agreement — baseball’s economy has often been backward. Players get paid less, relative to the market, in their pre-free agency years. The best recent example is Mike Trout winning the MVP in 2014 at age 22 while making $1 million.He got a raise to $6 million the next season, but in 2015 was still making a fraction of what people like Ryan Howard ($25M), Albert Pujols ($24M), Joe Mauer ($23M), Mark Teixeira ($22.5M) and Jose Reyes ($22M) were making.But that overpay is a necessary part baseball’s economic ecosystem too. It’s a fact: Players get overpaid as their careers decline. It’s almost like baseball’s way of making up for underpaying players during their early years. It’s baseball’s golden parachute. What’s happening these days is fewer teams are accepting that overpay as part of the how the system works.In the past few years, arbitration salaries have gotten higher and higher, and teams have tried harder to lock up younger stars before free agency. It’s why we’ve see players like Madison Bumgarner, Chris Archer, Chris Sale and Paul Goldschmidt become valuable trade chips for their team-friendly contract extensions.Teams are getting smarter about where their money goes, and how to keep value in their assets. These extensions to Severino, Nola and the rest show that they’re willing to spend money, just in the way that they want.Earlier this week, former Miami Marlins president David Samson tweeted something in response to Justin Verlander, saying the “broken system” talk was wrong. Players and their agents, Samson said, needed to adjust to a “new reality.”He may be right about the new reality part. The monster paydays at the end of the free agency tunnel could be fading away. If Bryce Harper and Manny Machado can’t get them, who can?The new reality could be players seizing their money. Whenever they can.– – – – – –Mike Oz is a writer at Yahoo Sports.

However, Wainwright framed the situation with a little more urgency on Friday by expressing concerns that a day of reckoning could happen sooner than later.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]Speaking to InsideSTL.com’s Tim McKernan, Wainwright said it was inevitable that the players will go on strike unless major changes are made to help bridge the widening gap. But he’s also worried that frustrations could reach a boiling point during the season leading to some form of a revolt. Perhaps even a mid-season walkout.#STLCards pitcher Adam Wainwright on @TMASTL: “Unless something changes, there’s going to be a strike. 100%. I’m just worried people are going to walk-out mid-season.” pic.twitter.com/M8WeRVcASe— Tim McKernan (@tmckernan) February 15, 2019“Unless something changes, there’s going to be a strike. 100%,” Wainwright said regarding the free-agent freeze that has left stars like Bryce Harper and Manny Machado without contracts. “I’m just worried people are going to walkout midseason.”It’s conceivable given the current climate, but a players revolt on that level still feels like a long shot. The target date we should all still be looking at is Dec. 1, 2021. That’s when the current collective bargaining agreement ends and the owners will be forced to come to the table.That doesn’t mean we should just dismiss Wainwright’s concerns about a 2019 strike. While they might feel a little on the dramatic side, the frustration that has built all offseason as dozens of free agents, including and especially Harper and Machado, remain unsigned is becoming more palpable by the day. There’s a genuine feeling that owners are determined to cut back on salaries even as profits continue to reach new heights, it’s possible the players’ patience will run out if the free-agent freeze continues to drag on. Wainwright thinks so, and he’s far from alone.In Friday’s interview, the 37-year-old right-hander also criticized owners and front offense personnel for placing too much emphasis on “analytics” and placing everything in a “sabermetric box” that discounts intangibles and other immeasurable aspects of baseball.Adam Wainwright said today on ⁦@TMASTL⁩ that he expects there to be a strike “100%.”The context of the conversation comes from a discussion on how Bryce Harper and Manny Machado are still without teams.You can see Wainwright’s reasoning in the video below. pic.twitter.com/GXsmx4cXk1— Tim McKernan (@tmckernan) February 15, 2019Wainwright admitted that there’s always risk in making long-term financial commitments to players, but emphasized that doing so marks a commitment to winning that several teams seemingly lack.“Part of it is smart from their side of it, but you have to realize it’s about winning. So, if Bryce Harper wants 10 years and he’s 26 years old. He’s going to be a dynamic player. The same can be said about Manny Machado. These guys are superstar players.”The deeper we get into it the more obvious it is that the players know what battles lie ahead. The only real question is how much worse it will get before any progress is made toward a satisfactory resolution.More from Yahoo Sports:• Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight MLB rumors: Bryce Harper has made his decision, says D.C. radio host originally appeared on nbcsportsbayarea.comA report has come out from the East Coast saying Bryce Harper has come to a decision on which team he will play for in 2019 and beyond.Chris Russell, a sports radio talk show host from 106.7 The Fan in Washington D.C., (who has been on the Harper beat for some time) said the free agent slugger could make a decision in the next 24 hours.\"Maybe I took a little bit of a leap of faith here based on some indications I got from a real good source,\" Russell told 94WIP, in Philadelphia, on Friday.\"Bryce and his representatives, (Scott) Boras, his people, his wife Kayla, they've been meeting since Monday morning in Vegas. Bryce originally wanted this done, when it took this long, by Valentine's Day. Obviously, the contract has not been announced, signed, or whatever.\"\"But I'm led to believe by the people that I've talked to that are close to the situation -- and I have, again, a real good source that has helped me through this process, let's just leave it at that,\" Russell said. \"That Bryce was in a mood to celebrate yesterday. Now, the source said, 'I believe it's done.' I don't have concrete, 100 percent proof for you guys. I wish I did, otherwise, I would have it and I would be running around with it. But I don't have that, so I want to caution everybody in Philadelphia. But that's what I was led to believe, that this thing is now decided.\"Russell then mentioned the Phillies.\"Now, what comes then is hammering out a contract. And if we were to believe the report that the Philadelphia Phillies had not even extended a formal offer -- and I assume that to be a termed, written agreement, that type of thing, which I find hard to believe -- then there might be more legwork to this. And therefore, hey the decision may be done, but the contract still needs to be ironed out.\"[RELATED: Phillies fan participates in \"lent\" in hopes of recruiting Harper]Russell is being safe with the terminology he's using, which is understandable. And while we haven't been able to confirm these rumors, Harper, along with many other free agents, remains unsigned.The Giants appeared to be the \"mystery team\" that introduced themselves late into the Harper sweepstakes -- and when the radio hosts asked Russell his opinion on where the outfielder will end up next season, he believed Harper will be in an orange and black uniform.\"I don't think it's going to be the Nationals,\" Russell said. \"I think it's going to be the San Francisco Giants, but that is not by any means an 'I know that for a fact,' so I want to caution everybody -- I know how this works -- I get in trouble with everything I say on my radio show, and everyone blows it up.\" The wait continues ... Golden State Warriors stars Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant empathised with Steve Kerr after the head coach was ejected during the loss to the Portland Trail Blazers having thrown a clipboard in response to a flagrant foul call.Kerr was enraged late in the fourth quarter when Draymond Green was called for a flagrant foul after he stopped Zach Collins from approaching the rim as he went up for a shot.That drew Kerr's ire and after ranting in one referee's face, he slammed a clipboard down to earn an ejection, with Durant having to escort his head coach back off the court.The Warriors lost the game 129-107 but will still head into the All-Star break with the best record in the Western Conference.\"It was an emotional game. We fought really hard for 43 minutes,\" Curry told reporters afterwards.\"One questionable decision - the flagrant - obviously the fire came out. You see coach go and throw a clipboard. At that point you try to get us over the hump. An eight-point swing, it's tough to overcome.\"\"I looked at the replay and the amount of ball [Green] got, there was nothing excessive about it, he got all the ball.\"There was a lot of chirping, with Zach involved. There was probably a sensitivity to it, trying to put out some fires, but I thought it was a terrible call. We obviously paid the price for it with how everything unfolded after that.\"Durant shared that sympathy having been the one to pull Kerr away from the referees as he continued to rant at them.\"I felt for him, I understand his anger and his rage, especially for that call,\" he said.\"I thought we should have just kept playing, It was a common foul, I thought. Refs looked at it differently. \"I understand why coach was a little frustrated.\"Kerr explained that it was the disbelief at the call that had triggered his reaction.\"I was just shocked that that was called a flagrant foul,\" he said. \"I'm not sure how it's determined - if it's in New York or the officials on the call - but that was head-scratching: that that could be called a flagrant foul.\"The guy's going to go in for a dunk, you've got to make sure he doesn't dunk it.\"So, I told Kenny [Mauer] that I beg to differ. There might have been a couple of other words in there too!\"I'll have to ask the owner if the clipboard broke when I threw it down. I got a little anger out so that was good. I was too busy yelling to ask for an explanation.\"Charles Barkley thinks New Orleans Pelicans star Anthony Davis made a mistake with his trade request.The 25-year-old asked the Pelicans to move him in late January and the Los Angeles Lakers had been engaged in discussions about acquiring him. But, no deal was reached before the deadline and Davis remained with New Orleans.Barkley, an 11-time All-Star who works as an analyst for TNT, said he thinks Davis and his agent, Rich Paul, mishandled the situation.\"Don't ruin your reputation as a great player, one of the nicest guys in the world,\" Barkley told reporters on Thursday ahead of All-Star weekend (via the Washington Post).\"Remember, your agent works for you, you don't work for him. They handled that situation wrong. It's going to come back to bite them in the a***. It's unfortunate.\"The six-time All-Star entered play on Thursday averaging 28.5 points and 13.1 rebounds this season. But, he scored just three points in 24 minutes on the floor in the Pelicans' 118-88 loss to the Orlando Magic earlier this week.\"This is a bad situation,\" Barkley said. \"It's a bad look for the NBA. Because that kid can't go out there and give 100 per cent because he’s worried about getting hurt. The guy's the second-best player in the world and he's got three points? That's not a good look for the NBA.\"The Boston Celtics and New York Knicks, among others, are expected to explore dealing for Davis after the season. Barkley, however, said he believes the forward will eventually land in Los Angeles because of Paul's relationship with Lakers star LeBron James.Barkley tallied 22.1 points and 11.7 rebounds per game over his 16-year career. He retired in 2000 and was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame six years later.After an apology from Sergio Garcia, a non-apology from Matt Kuchar, and an uncooperative Mother Nature on Valentine's Day, it's time for everyone to focus again on Tiger Woods. Kidding. Sort of. A weather-delayed first round at Riviera re-starts on Friday morning and the 14-time major champ will be in the Hollywood-area spotlight as he finally begins his Genesis Open. And golf fans could potentially see a LOT of the tournament host as the event tries to play catch up after heavy rains on Thursday.Woods, Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas (Decent group, eh?) are scheduled to tee off at 8:32 local time (11:32 ET). The hope is they will complete their first rounds and then play as much of their second rounds as possible before darkness. And Tiger's hope is to finally win for the first time at this historic layout where he missed the cut last year. We'll be tracking Tiger every step of the way so keep it right here for the latest scores, news and highlights. (All times eastern)SATURDAY, 11:25: With a 25-foot birdie putt on No. 9, Woods' final hole of the second round, Tiger will likely make the cut. The birdie brought Woods back to even on his round and to one under overall.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096808527694245890After resuming play in the morning, Woods bogeyed his first hole, No. 4, then made four pars before his finishing birdie. His playing partners, however, fared much better. Justin Thomas shares the lead with Adam Scott at 11 under and Rory McIlroy birdied four of his six holes on Saturday morning to shoot 63 and move to seven under through 36 holes. Thursday's early wave is now on the course for their second rounds.-------------------FRIDAY-------------------8:25: And with that, the horn has sounded—play will be suspended for darkness on Friday at Riviera. Tiger, JT and Rory have six more holes to complete their second round. Justin Thomas is at 10-under, tied with Adam Scott for the lead. Tiger will hope Saturday brings some different momentum for him—as this marathon day ends with two bogeys in a row after the highlight eagle.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10965708926692065298:21: That's back-to-back bogeys now for Tiger Woods, dropping another shot here at the third hole (his 12th of the round). And over his past six holes, Tiger has four bogeys. The birdie at No. 1 helped negate most of that damage ... but Tiger's back to 1-under again—right on the current cut line.8:13: On his 30th hole of the day, Tiger is showing some obvious signs of being tired. And who could blame him—he's been playing golf for nearly 10 hours straight. From 165 yards out at the third hole, Tiger Woods tries to chop out a 6-iron and comes out of it. His ball comes to rest short of the green. With sunset in Pacific Palisades being 5:30 local time, this group will have time for maybe one more hole today.8:04: Tiger follows up that eagle putt at No. 1 with a bogey at the second hole. The third bogey of his second round moves Tiger back to 2-under overall.7:56: After a long wait at the second hole, Tiger sprays his second shot from 235 out with a fairway wood out to the right. He'll have his work cut out from the front right bunker to save par at the 482-yard par 4.7:40: This is exactly what Tiger Woods needed: He rolls in his 43-foot eagle putt at his 10th hole (the first) to get back to 3-under—negating those two bogeys he made on his front nine. What a putt! With the flagstick in!https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096570892669206529Tiger made a disappointing par to open his first round earlier today at the first hole. The unlikely eagle makes up for that effort—and could turn around Tiger's second round in a dramatic way. Tiger goes from toeing the cut line at 1-under to now all of a sudden being T-21.7:28: Tiger finds the fairway at the par-5 first hole, the group's 10th hole of their second round, as he attempts to get a shot back here after bogeying two of his final three holes on his front nine. Neither bogey was particularly bad—the 18th hole is playing brutally tough right now uphill and into the wind with the rain, making it even more of a challenging hole. And his break at 16 was very unlucky.7:16: Tiger and JT are gonna have their work cut out to save par at the 18th hole (their ninth). Each player had fairway wood approaches and tried playing a big cut. JT was way up left on the hill—Tiger was closer. He went high with his approach and will have about 11 feet left for par.Tiger misses the par putt, so he'll drop a shot along with JT as they make the turn. Tiger moves back to 1-under after 27 holes. That's where the cut line currently is—so all of a sudden, Tiger must be concerned about making the cut.7:01: Following Justin Thomas throwing a dart at the 17th to about 3 feet, Tiger puts his wedge shot from under 100 yards to outside 20 feet, so he'll be disappointed with that effort. The birdie putt misses on the high side, and Tiger taps in for par to remain at 2-under. His playing partner and buddy Justin Thomas stays hot, rolling in a fourth straight birdie to get to 9-under—tied for the lead with Adam Scott. Really impressive golf here from JT.6:54: The rain is really coming down now as the players head to the 17th hole. Tiger finds the fairway at the par-5 17th hole, but it was a short one—he has 326 yards left. Most players have been laying up at this par 5 all day.6:43: From a brutal position up against the back lip of the bunker, Tiger hacks it out—and somehow keeps the ball on the green, albeit the back portion. His par attempt from 44 feet away here comes up three feet shy. Tiger makes his bogey to move back to 2-under.Meanwhile, Justin Thomas is officially on fire. He has another birdie after a fabulous tee shot at 16. It's now two Kentucky boys tied at the top: Justin Thomas and J.B. Holmes (-8).https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10965576791939317766:39: Tiger will have serious lie issues at the par-3 16th hole. His tee shot came to rest up against the back lip of the bunker. As Billy Kratzert just remarked on PGA Tour Live, Tiger will do well just to keep this ball on the green. Though he avoided dropping a shot on his last hole, there might be a bogey in his future here.6:35: A clutchhh par save by Tiger at the 15th hole makes up for his poor chip—and Tiger keeps the momentum going on his second round, as he stays 3-under for the tournament and 2-under on the round.Justin Thomas, also in Tiger's group, holed out from in front of the green for birdie at the 14th hole, and he makes a long birdie putt at 15 to get to 7-under—just one back of fellow Kentucky native J.B. Holmes.6:32: A poor chip shot from Tiger at the 15th hole leaves him about 13 feet away. He'll need to convert that putt to prevent dropping his first shot of his second round.6:24: Tiger finds another fairway here at Riviera, this one at the 15th hole. The guy is feeeling it with his driver. Almost on auto pilot. His approach from 190 out turns a little too much, finding the rough to the left of the green. He'll have to get up and down to avoid dropping one here.6:20: From 20 feet out, Tiger's birdie bid comes up shy—never really scaring the hole, despite getting a good look at the line from Rory's putt. Tiger taps in for par to remain at 3-under.The putter has been disappointing for Tiger all day: He had 34 putts in his first round, including four three-putts, just the third time in his career he's done that.6:13: Tiger puts his tee shot at the par-3 14th hole just inside Rory's ball—about 20 feet right of the hole. He'll get a little teach from Rory's putt, too, as Tiger continues to hit it well today.6:07: Tiger just misses the left-to-right curling bid for birdie, leaving himself with an easy par at 13. He stays 3-under for the tournament and -2 through four on his round.Tiger's playing partners are also playing well—Rory has three birdies in his first four holes to get to 2-under. Look out for Rory at rainy Riviera. And Justin Thomas, despite hitting his tee shot out of bounds at 13, got up and down from 160 yards to avoid dropping multiple shots. He's now 5-under after that bogey.6:02: Another grooved tee shot for Tiger Woods at the 13th hole puts him in good position. He turned over his tee shot—putting his draw in the middle of the fairway at the dogleg left. Tiger spins his approach back to about 15 feet, just off the green in the fringe. He'll have a chance to knock another one here and keep the momentum going.5:51: Bang! Tiger nails the 25-footer for birdie at the 12th hole to add a second birdie to his card through three holes. Realistically, too, it could be three straight birdies for Tiger. But the 14-time major champion is now 2-under through 3—T-3 for the tournament (T-19)—and carries some strong momentum on his side at the start of his second round ... as the rain is coming down at Riviera.5:46: Tiger hits his approach hole high—about 25 feet from 181 yards. He'll have another chance to add a birdie to his third round.Tiger's currently at 2-under, which puts him at T-29. The projected cut is at 1-under—so he's comfortably inside the number as of now. But there's a ton of golf to be played, obviously.5:41: Tiger finds the fairway with his driver at the par-4 12th hole. The 12th usually plays as one of the toughest holes at Riviera—we'll see if Tiger can take advantage of his position here in the fairway.5:33: An excellent fairway-wood second shot by Tiger put him right in front of the par-5 11th green in two. But a very poor approach putt for his third leaves him more than 10 feet away. His birdie try slides by for a very disappointing par being so close in 2. That should've been a golden opportunity to start his second round with two birdies—instead, Tiger stays at 2-under.5:12: Tiger goes high with his pitch—having to navigate around the front bunker, and plays it nicely—spinning it about 7 feet short of the hole. So Tiger will have a good look for an opening birdie to start his second round. Tiger converts the birdie putt to move to 2-under.5:02: Only a little more than a half hour after finishing his first round, Tiger Woods (-1) -- along with Justin Thomas (-5) and Rory McIlroy (+1) -- has teed off in his second round. The group started on the drivable 10th hole, and Tiger has driven his tee shot just off the green. He'll have a chance to put his pitch shot close to start his second round with a birdie.4:24: Tiger narrowly misses the birdie putt at the 18th hole, so he'll tap in for a par and an opening-round, one-under 70 at Riviera. Having three-putted for a fourth time on the 17th hole to drop a shot in disappointing fashion, Tiger will head to his second round a bit frustrated. But the four consecutive birdies showed him being able to score well at Riviera, where he has never won.Tiger, JT (who birdied 18 to finish at 5-under) and Rory will head right back for their second round in this marathon day for them.4:18: Tiger responds to that shocking three-putt with a perfect drive and a towering 6-iron on Riviera's famed 18th. Woods is in good shape to at least make par the difficult hole, but as we've seen all day, a two-putt is anything but automatic.Here's an unusual stat on Tiger three-putting four times this afternoon. He's making some history in a bad way...https://twitter.com/JustinRayGolf/status/10965196250582507574:06: So much for the momentum. . . After a decent approach shot that spins back to about 20 feet, Woods runs his birdie putt a couple feet by and. . . gulp. . . misses the comebacker from about two feet. Wow. That's four three-putts on the day as Tiger falls back to one under with one hole to play.3:57: Uh-oh, it's raining in southern California again. Meanwhile, Woods is plodding his way up the par-5 17th. After pulling his drive into the left rough and drawing a poor lie, Woods pushed his layup slightly into the first cut of the right rough. He'll have a some sort of wedge to a back-right hole location.3:50: Tiger's tee shot was tracking on the par-3 16th, but it comes up about 30 feet short. From there, he two-putts for par to remain at two under. Justin Thomas makes his 10-foot birdie effort to move to four under, while Rory McIlroy remains at one over. McIlroy hast two holes to avert his first over-par score of 2019.3:40: After another great drive and a solid approach, Woods races his birdie attempt nearly five feet past the hole. But he keeps the overall positive momentum going by converting the par putt to remain at two under. Tiger has three more holes to play. At least, before he gets a lunch break.3:24: BANG! There's the bounce back from Tiger. It just came one hole later. And from farther away as Woods drains his 12-footer for birdie on No. 14.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096507996031467520Woods is now back to two under, five shots behind Jordan Spieth, who has to be pleased to still be in front by two despite these soft conditions.3:17: Tiger hits a great shot on the difficult par-3 14th hole to about 15 feet. He'll have a good look at birdie coming up. In the meantime, here's a look at how the leader board stands with Jordan Spieth still leading the way.Jordan Spieth (-7) 2t. Tony Finau (-5) 2t. Patrick Rodgers (-5) 2t. Kramer Hickok (-5) 2t. Davis Love III (-5) 2t. Adam Scott (-5) 2t. J.B. Homes (-5)Click here for full scores.3:13: Woods stuck his approach to about four feet below the hole on No. 13. A bounce back birdie looked like a forgone conclusion until he pushed his effort. Woof. That's two three-putts and two short misses on the greens for Tiger today. He remains at one under. Meanwhile, Rory McIlroy, after getting to two under through eight, has fallen to one over after back-to-back bogeys. Justin Thomas, the third player in the group, continues to lead this trio at three under.3:05: After hitting fade after fade, Woods steps to the 13th tee and rips a draw around the corner, perfectly setting up his next shot. Good to see him working it both ways with ease.3:01: Tiger pushed his tee shot into the right rough, then hit a fantastic recovery shot from a thick lie onto the green. He had a long look at birdie that rolled about four feet past, leaving him with a tricky left-to-right par putt, which he missed. That's three three putts on the day for Woods, and he's still one under.2:39: Not the best chip from Woods, as he left himself about six feet for birdie, but he makes it anyway. Four straight for Tiger to get to two under for the day.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10964952191957975042:30: Woods rips a 3-wood from 269 to just in front of the green. Hate to jinx him, but there's no reason he shouldn't easily make his fourth straight birdie here (ducks).2:20: Three in a row for Woods as he rolls in another at No. 10 and moves to one under. If he finds the fairway again at the 11th, four in a row will be in his sights. Meanwhile, Rory makes his par to stay at one under and JT ends up holing his 10 footer for birdie to get to four under. Finally a little bit of JUICE from this threesome.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096489287753711616https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096489787672780800By the way, it looks like we know when they'll be heading back out for round two later today. Here's an update from the Tiger Tracker:https://twitter.com/GCTigerTracker/status/1096481806067523585That should give them enough time to get at least 11 or 12 holes in.At the 11th, Woods stripes another drive down the fairway. He's really starting to cook.2:12: Tiger's shot was a tad more difficult than we thought, as he had to avoid a bunker and take it up high to get it back to the pin. He was successful, sticking it to about three feet. Hell of a shot. Even better was Rory's shot, as he flopped it from a nice lie and got it to hang on just off the back of the green and stay out of the back bunker. Thomas, who had the easiest shot, put too much spin on his chip, leaving himself with about 10 feet for birdie.2:07: Finally, Tiger, Rory and JT hit their tee shots, and it looks like the ensuing entertainment will be well worth the wait. Tiger is in the collection area left of the green, where he has a straightforward chip that should set him up with a good chance to make birdie. Thomas is just in front of the green, and he'll have a great chance to make a birdie as well. Rory ... um ... not so much. He's in the rough with a greenside bunker in front of him and a pin he won't be able to get close to, and just holding the green would be a miracle.1:52: Woods drains his four-footer for bird and turns in even par 35. Real strong finish to his opening nine, and now it looks like he'll have a long wait at the 10th. DeChambeau, Kuchar and Rahm have still yet to hit their tee shots.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10964831254067896321:47: Tiger had just 122 left to the green and stuck one in there close. He has four feet left for birdie to turn in even par, which would be a small victory after that ugly three putt back at No. 7. Not to mention he'll have a prime opportunity to get into red figures at the driveable par-4 10th.1:41: Woods cranks another high fade right down the middle with the driver at No. 9. With the tees up today, he'll have a low iron in his hand for his approach.1:34: And he's on the board! Woods bounces back with a birdie putt from 15 feet, getting him back to one over. We'll see if that gets him going before making the turn.1:30: From 125 yards out, Woods hit a wedge and hated it from the second he made contact. While he did pull it, he's still hole high and inside 20 feet. Hideki Matsuyama-esque move from Tiger.1:24: Woods rips one right down the middle at the par-4 eighth. Should have a short iron in.1:15: Tiger's birdie putt was actually from just off the green on the fringe, and he rolled it by some four feet. Then, he missed the comebacker for par, dropping to two over on the day. Oof.1:09: Fairway and a green for Woods at the seventh. Good look at birdie coming up to get back to level par.12:58: Another hole, another par for Woods, who two-putted from 24 feet on the par-3 sixth. In the group up ahead, though, Jon Rahm is making a move at three under through six.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/109646557828021452912:47: Another meh hole for Tiger on No. 5, just missing the fairway with his tee shot, finding the front of the green with a so-so approach, and two-putting for another par from 43 feet. Woods remains at one over through five holes while his playing partners, McIlroy and Thomas, both remain at one under.12:42: As Matt Kuchar's ball is in the air on the par-3 sixth, a fan yells, \"Go low—just not with the gratuity!\" Despite Matt maintaining this is \"not a story,\" it is. And this won't be the last comment like this.12:29: Woods hit a nice shot to about 15 feet on the par-3 fourth, but ran his birdie effort by the hole. Still one over. Still no highlights. At least, from Tiger. Here was Spieth's closing birdie from about an hour ago, because there is not much else exciting going on right now.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/109644546143346688112:17: Another missed fairway and another short approach from Tiger on the par-4 third. Although, Woods found the putting surface, he was unable to two-putt from 63 feet, missing a seven-footer for par after badly misreading his first putt. That drops Tiger to one over through three holes. Not a lot of highlights so far. . .12:02: Tiger misses right off the tee on No. 2 then comes up short on another approach. But his pitch shot nearly goes down, leaving him with a tap-in par. Even par through two holes.11:49: After that perfect opening tee shot, Tiger hit a hideous approach with a 5-iron that came up way short in a fairway bunker. From there, he hit his third to 10 feet but missed the putt to walk away with a disappointing par. Both of Tiger's playing partners, McIlroy and Thomas, make birdie.11:38: Matt Kuchar just misses his eagle attempt from 25 feet on No. 1, but taps in for birdie. Kuchar has been in the news a lot this week over a caddie controversy dating back to his win at the Mayakoba Golf Classic. A controversy he didn't help with his comments on Wednesday. Is it possible some of those \"Kuuuuch\" shouts will turn to \"Mooooch\"? Kinda sounded like it on the first hole. . .11:34: Jordan Spieth is in with a seven-under-par 64 to take the early lead. Spieth needed only 21 putts during his bogey-free round. Of course, starting tournaments hasn't been a problem for Spieth of late. Finishing, however, has been a different story. Incredibly, Spieth is looking for his first win since the 2017 British Open and his first top 5 since last year's Masters.11:32: Woods smashes a driver off the first tee that finds the fairway. The opening par 5 at Riviera is essentially a long par 4 and one of the easiest holes on the PGA Tour all year so Tiger is thinking at least birdie after that tee shot.10:53: So far, so good on the Friday weather:https://twitter.com/GCTigerTracker/status/1096437235262533632And with lift, clean and place in play (for at least the first round), low scores are out there. Let's set the over/under on the Par-71 layout at 68.5.10:45: We are approximately 45 minutes away from Tiger's tee time and it's another major champ who is already off to a fantastic start. Jordan Spieth has the lead at six under through 15 holes. Spieth leads Patrick Rodgers by one and then there's a big group at four under, including Bill Haas, who is playing in the event a year after being involved in a car accident during last year's tournament that killed a friend he was staying with. Make sure you read Brian Wacker's piece from earlier in the week on how Haas is still trying to move on from that tragedy.10:35: As we move within an hour from Tiger teeing off, check out GOLFTV's latest behind-the-scenes video with Woods in which he says his bag has up to 16(!) golf gloves during rainy rounds and he explains why he doesn't like wearing rain jackets:https://twitter.com/GOLFTV/status/1096246456795697153\"Pops used to say, 'Once you're wet, you're wet.

Once he started running the front office, his blinking at Paul George on national TV contributed to the Lakers getting fined again for tampering. Johnson’s praise of Giannis Antetokounmpo drew yet another tampering fine.So, though he escaped punishment for his recent comments on 76ers guard Ben Simmons, Johnson refused to answer a question about Hornets guard Kemba Walker.Carolina Blitz:Asked Magic about Kemba and he said y’all aren’t going to catch him slipping anymore. pic.twitter.com/sQZtIWnQbn— Carolina Blitz (@KeepBlitzin) February 15, 2019Johnson:You know I can’t answer any questions about no players, because every time I do it, I get fined. But anybody else do it, they don’t get fined. So I’m going to stay away from that one.I don’t blame Johnson for feeling that way.Other teams’ owners, coaches and executives have repeatedly publicly discussed rival players without facing announced punishment.To be fair, the NBA doesn’t reveal every fine. Bucks owner Marc Lasry reportedly just got fined for tampering, but the league never announced it. But, at minimum, there’s an inconsistency with how the NBA exposes Johnson’s transgressions.Even NBA commissioner Adam Silver said last year there’s a spotlight on the Lakers due to prior tampering. That strikes me as unfair. The Lakers already paid for their prior violations and should now be held to the same standard as everyone else.And for what it’s worth, I wish that standard allowed an all-time great point guard like Johnson to publicly share his thoughts on Kemba Walker.Gareth Bale has landed himself in hot water after La Liga denounced the Real Madrid star for his celebration in the Madrid derby, which could carry a ban of four to 12 games.The Welsh forward scored as a substitute in the 3-1 victory over Atletico Madrid, bringing up his 100th goal for the club.And during the celebrations that followed, Bale \"lifted his right arm near his head in a clear sign of provocation towards the fans, then giving a gesture which could be seen as obscene and disdainful by folding his arm and striking it with his other hand.\"In a statement released by La Liga, Bale’s punishment will be decided by whether he incited the crowd or not.If Bale is guilty of “inciting opposition fans” to cause a hostile reaction, the punishment could carry four to 12 games, if there was no hostile reaction but intent, then it could be as little as one to three games.The gesture is referred to in Spain as ‘corte de mangas,’ with the moment not picked up in the referee’s match report.A committee will now decide whether the gesture merits a punishment.Bale also featured in Real’s Champions League victory over Ajax.Los Blancos take a 2-1 lead back to the Bernabeu for the second leg of the last 16 tie after Marco Asensio’s late winner.Earlier this week Heisman Trophy winner — and first round draft pick of the Oakland Athletics — Kyler Murray chose football over baseball, committing himself to the NFL draft. It was a move that, however sensible from Murray’s point of view, has led to a lot of soul-searching among baseball folks and has raised questions about what the sport offers young, talented athletes with other options.It’s not that bleak, however! Another outstanding college football player said no to football this week and reaffirmed his commitment to baseball. Tim Tebow! From PFT:One Florida Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback will not be coaching another in the Alliance of American Football.Steve Spurrier, the Florida Heisman winner who later coached the Gators to a national championship and is now head coach of the AAF’s Orlando Apollos, said this morning on PFT Live that after the AAF briefly reached out to Tebow in the ball, it became clear that Tebow’s focus is on playing baseball.Ok, so maybe Tebow is not turning down quite the football opportunity that Murray would’ve been. But take your victories where you can get them, baseball.Follow @craigcalcaterraPhil Mickelson is on an all-time heater in the early portion of the 2019 season. In the last month alone he's won his 44th PGA Tour event, finished second in another, hit every fairway in a round for the first time in 21 years, shot a 60, pulled off this impossible recovery shot, gone viral just by rolling his eyes and said he might drop the Players from his schedule because he's already won it (a literal mic drop). The man simply cannot be stopped right now.Leave it to the weather to literally rain on Lefty's parade. On Thursday at the Genesis Open, Mickelson began his first round at the difficult short par-4 10th and drove into one of the bunkers up near the green, leaving him with a dreaded lengthy sand shot. He wound up hitting it over the green, and his ball plugged in the back bunker, setting up an even harder shot than he just had. As you'll hear PGA Tour Live commentator Shane Bacon say, avoiding making a six was probably the goal, but after Mickelson hit his third into another bunker on the other side of the green, a six suddenly became best-case scenario. How does a four sound instead?https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096076528142626818Find us a more Phil Mickelson par ever... you can't. He's always got a flair for the dramatic. The problem? It's not going to count, as the tour wiped scores from the first 30 minutes of play due to the weather, thus making this the greatest par that never counted. It still counts in his mind though:https://twitter.com/PhilMickelson/status/1096106399958937605Peak Phil.RELATED: Where does Phil Mickelson rank among the greatest OMGs? (Old man golfers)The dust is barely settled in the wake of the end of the Markelle Fultz era in Philadelphia, and the former 76ers guard is already taking shots at his old team.His old coach Brett Brown in particular.Fultz had his introductory press conference with the Orlando Magic on Thursday after being traded at last week’s deadline and praised his new coach Steve Clifford while taking a veiled shot at Brown.“It just excites me to know that I have a coach that’s going to push you to be better and not just going to tell you what you want to hear,” Fultz said.That’s direct praise for his new coach. But the message for Brown is clear. Fultz didn’t like what he heard from the Philadelphia coaching staff.Fultz never had any public dispute with the 76ers, but it was evident that he and the team had different approaches to the struggles that saw him shoot 41.4 percent from the field, 26.7 percent from 3-point distance and 53.4 percent from the line in limited action after being selected as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2017 draft.It’s still not clear whether injury or a mental block – or both – are the cause of his shooting issues.After his agent announced that the nerve disorder thoracic outlet syndrome was the root of the shooting woes, Fultz never played again for the 76ers.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]Fultz appears to be fully embracing the fresh start in Orlando as a player and a person.“I think the biggest thing we talked about what doing thing the right way,” Fultz said. “Just building me up both as a man and on the court. I think that’s music to my ears, really just. Two things I really want to do is be the best player I can be and be the best young man I can be.”Fultz described the experience of his nerve disorder to reporters.“It’s hard to lift up your arms, you lose feeling in your fingers,” Fultz said. “You can’t tell when it’s going to happen. It’s not like you do the same motion every time. You get tingling in your fingers, numbness. Stuff like that.”He also curtly dismissed any notion that his shooting struggles are due to anything but injury.“I had an injury,” Fultz said. “I was out there trying to play through that. I never lost confidence.”Asked about a timetable to return, Fultz dodged the question to talk about rehab.“Right now it’s just about getting everything the right way,” he said. “Rehab’s been going great. I’m just taking my time and doing everything the right way.”More from Yahoo Sports: • PGA Tour pro defends paying caddie $5K on $1.3M win • NFL bars NCAA’s all-time sack leader from combine • Only one NBA team failed to scout Antetokounmpo • Black History honor for Kaepernick sacked by lawmakers He might not be well known to NFL fans at large, but New England Patriots fans know linebacker Kyle Van Noy — acquired basically for free from the Detroit Lions at the 2016 trade deadline — has been a big part of the defense the last two years, and has a knack for making plays at the right time.Van Noy is getting a little shine after winning his second Super Bowl ring with New England, appearing on the “Pardon My Take” podcast on Thursday to dish on all things Patriots and Super Bowl LIII.One thing that Van Noy revealed: the Los Angeles Rams didn’t do anything surprising during the game on offense.“I couldn’t believe that,” Van Noy said. “They really didn’t do — not one wrinkle. I was like, ‘What the hell?’ They’ve got so many good players, they’ve got so many things they’ve done all year, and the one play they gave us which was a wrinkle was the [Brandin] Cooks screen that hit for a little bit.“And that was it… Or maybe too, we were playing so good they were like, ‘[Expletive], we don’t know what to do.’ ”Hindsight, of course, is 20-20, but given that the Patriots’ coaching staff is known for having its players prepared for any and everything, it seems unwise that Los Angeles didn’t add some new plays or looks to try to stump New England.Van Noy said the Patriots’ culture, specifically coach Bill Belichick’s practice of not sparing anyone in the film room, even Tom Brady, is part of why the team continues to win.“Oh yeah. Yeah, that [stuff is] sick, to be honest, because it sets the table,” Van Noy said. “Like, OK, it doesn’t matter who you are, everyone’s on an even playing field. This is how it is here at work. You come in and you earn everything.“And I respect that because I felt like that gave me a chance to get on the field when I came in mid-year, and [Belichick] was like, ‘It doesn’t matter who you are or what you’ve done. You earn your keep.’ ”More from Yahoo Sports: • Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight The Brady Conundrum: How do you go about replacing the GOAT? originally appeared on nbcsportsboston.comThe Patriots hatched a Tom Brady succession plan after the 2013 season when they drafted Jimmy Garoppolo.Brady blew that up.Now, five years, four Super Bowl appearances, three Super Bowl wins, two Super Bowl MVPs and a regular-season MVP later, it's time to gingerly -- caaaauuuuuutiooooousssssllllyyyyy -- begin the process again.This time should be different.Even though Brady's contract hasn't been extended past the 2019 season, the love and happiness we saw on the field after the Rams were dispatched in SB53 is a good sign.MORE PATRIOTSAreas of Change: Will Pats be able to retain free agents Trey Flowers and Trent Brown?Brady's wariness about the Patriots' plans for him, and Bill Belichick's wariness about wedding his team to a quarterback who's closer to 50 years old than he is to 30, has dissipated.Once a new deal is in place -- Jonathan Kraft indicated that might be before training camp, though as of the Super Bowl conversations hadn't started -- Brady will have a written assurance that he will leave the Patriots and the NFL on his terms.That wasn't the case in early 2014 when the soon-to-be-37-year-old Brady saw the Patriots spend a first-round pick on a defensive tackle (Dominique Easley) and their second-rounder on Garoppolo. That, after a '13 season Brady spent throwing to the likes of Aaron Dobson, Josh Boyce, Kenbrell Thompkins and Austin Collie.Garoppolo was a stick of dynamite under Brady's behind. He was the existential threat Brady feared made flesh.Jimmy might have thought he was drafted to learn how to play quarterback in the NFL and have a nice career. To Brady, Garoppolo was there to take his job, throw his career into upheaval, uproot his family and see Brady cast out into the NFL wilderness.MORE PATRIOTSPerry: If Beckham is on the trade block, should Patriots be willing to pay the price?And, in contrast to the guy Brady succeeded in 2001 (and, by extension, did all those things to), Brady wasn't going to snort derisively at the plucky little draft pick here to take his job. He would crush the threat.He did.Brady played so well that -- despite Garoppolo developing into a bona-fide front-line quarterback under Belichick and Josh McDaniels (and Brady) -- Brady left the ever-prepared Patriots with no recourse when Garoppolo's contract was about to expire.Brady was too good to bench and too important to trade. Garoppolo was too expensive to franchise and too smart to take a \"bridge\" contract so he could watch Brady from the sidelines while his own hair started to gray at the temples. So off he went around Halloween, 2017.A lot's happened in the 16 months since.MORE PATRIOTSPhil Perry's Mock Draft 1.0: Pats start looking for Gronk's replacementBut now here we are, in the offseason of Brady's 42nd year. And the complex question of how to find the player who will eventually replace the greatest quarterback in NFL history still lingers.Do you draft his successor? If you do, do you do it this year? Do you do it next year?Do you try to get into the top 10 to get your pick of the litter? Do you stay put, confident that the muttonheads across the league will miss out as they did with Brady and Garoppolo (or Aaron Rodgers, Russell Wilson, Drew Brees, Brett Favre, Johnny Unitas . . . you get the point)? How much will it cost to get into the top 10? Do you package picks from this season -- when you will have six in the first three rounds -- and pick a sucker who will suck next year and fleece them for their 2020 first-rounder? How high do you have to go for a blue-chip, given the number of first-round quarterbacks that will be taken this year and that were taken in 2018?Is it a trade for somebody another team's given up on or has no work for, like San Francisco's Nick Mullens? A veteran who will hit free agency like Nick Foles, Case Keenum or Teddy Bridgewater?How does the successor play the position? Similar to Brady in that brain/eyes/accuracy/commitment trumps legs/arm strength/versatility?MORE PATRIOTSShould Pats be interested in Demaryius Thomas? No . . . and yesOr is there an embrace of the fact that trying to find a quarterback similar to a guy who came into the league after four years at Michigan at the end of last century with a once-in-a-lifetime work ethic is a pipe dream?Aside from who the successor is and how he plays, can Brady -- the lion in winter -- be tapped to help groom whoever is being brought aboard to take over?Brady -- contrary to sexed-up speculation -- didn't actively undermine Garoppolo at any point. They were teammates. He helped Garoppolo play the position better. They became close. But he wasn't quite showing him his world, either. Brady is famous for saying he's not giving away his secrets to younger quarterbacks until after he's done.With the end-date likely to be agreed upon when he signs an extension, does he become more a mentor so that the success of the franchise has a better chance to continue after he leaves? Would the Patriots want him to do that?Or would they want a blank(ish) slate to work with that isn't saying, \"But Tom said . . . \" when they try to shape him to succeed?And that contract? What's it look like? Does Brady demand pay commensurate with what he's accomplished? Is he in the mood to do the team another financial solid given the only bump they have him in 2018 was incentives he never reached? How does that impact the structure of the team?These questions aren't new. What is new is the level of angst and anxiousness. It's dissipated tremendously.That won't make finding his replacement or choosing the means by which the Patriots will do it any easier. But it's less fraught now.The irony is, the Patriots already successfully found Brady's successor. It's just that 2014 was too soon to go looking for him.Now, can they do it again?Click here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!

Before the team's loss to the Blazers on Wednesday night, he told ESPN that he \"wants to finish his career as a Warrior.\"      View this post on Instagram    Klay wants to stay in The Bay.A post shared by  espn (@espn) on Feb 13, 2019 at 9:23pm PSTThompson is set to be an unrestricted free agent at the end of the 2018-19 season.This isn't the first time Klay has made his feelings known. Even his father Mychal, who played five seasons for the Lakers, believes his son will re-sign with the Warriors. [RELATED: For Steve Kerr, Steph Curry and Klay Thompson are mix of NBA past and present]The Warriors selected Thompson with the No. 11 overall pick in the 2011 NBA Draft. Since then, he's been a five-time NBA All-Star, three-time Finals champion and two-time All-NBA selection. Anything could happen, but it's safe to say the Klay and the Dubs have quite the relationship and are ready to tie the knot.Jason Witten never worked with Kellen Moore as a coach, but he did practice with Moore when both of them were still active players with the Cowboys.That experience is enough for Witten to think Moore has “a way about him” that will pay off in his new job as the Cowboys offensive coordinator. Witten said this week that he believes Moore will be innovative and that the offense will take a “big step” by gearing things around quarterback Dak Prescott.“Yeah, I think he will do the things that Dak likes to do,” Witten said, via the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. “He will do the things they have to do to win. That is the way they have to play. I think they will use the pass to set up the run. Not just the run to set up the pass. I think he will add some nice wrinkles to that offense.”With head coach Jason Garrett coaching in the final year of his contract, Moore’s work with the offense will have a lot to do with how Dallas does in 2019 and with the path the team charts in the years that follow. If Witten’s correct, that path will probably look a lot like the one they’ve been on for a while.The story of Danny Ainge's Greece visit to watch Giannis Antetokounmpo is a wild one originally appeared on nbcsportsboston.comThe Boston Celtics took an early interest in Greece basketball star Giannis Antetokounmpo before he was selected in the 2013 NBA Draft.C's president of basketball operations Danny Ainge actually went over to Europe to watch Antetokounmpo play, and the postgame scene was nothing short of crazy.Fans were going wild, and some of them even yelled at Ainge because they thought he was associated with Antetokounmpo's team -- Ainge was sitting near its bench during the game.Check out the video below to hear the wild story of Ainge's scouting visit to Greece:Time for another \"Finding Giannis\" outtake. The first NBA team to scout Giannis was the Boston Celtics. As is often the case in Greece, hilarity ensued, as told by @GrgpanouOCT about Danny Ainge's visit. #FindingGiannis will be broadcasted Saturday on TNT at 630pm EST. pic.twitter.com/8bLjIjHv77— Jonathan Givony (@DraftExpress) February 14, 2019The Celtics liked what they saw from Antetokounmpo, but they decided to take Gonzaga forward/center Kelly Olynyk with their 2013 first-round pick instead. The C's made a trade with the Dallas Mavericks (who owned the No. 13 pick) to select Olynyk, whose ability to handle the ball and shoot well from the outside as a big man was appealing.Antetokounmpo ultimately was taken by the Milwaukee Bucks with the 15th pick. The \"Greek Freak\" has since become one of the league's best players and arguably is the leading candidate for MVP this season. It's still hard to fault Ainge and other executives for passing on Antetokounmpo, though. He was a very raw talent, and other players in that draft class were expected to provide more immediate contributions.Click here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!

Yahoo Sports' Charles Robinson and Amanda Borges address the settlement between the players and the NFL, and what it means for their continuing efforts to promote social activism.The NBA jerseys of the future have a new feature to them: the ability to customize them after purchase by changing the name and number.In an awkward reveal reminiscent of a tech presentation, NBA commissioner Adam Silver and sportscaster Ahmad Rashad demonstrated the jersey at the NBA Tech Summit on Friday ahead of All-Star Weekend in Charlotte, switching a No. 30 Stephen Curry jersey to No. 23 Michael Jordan threads.Adam Silver just revealed the NBA jersey of the future that changes the name and number 🤯(via @NBA)pic.twitter.com/cgJk7KcIIU— Yahoo Sports (@YahooSports) February 15, 2019If Silver is trying to pull a Steve Jobs, perhaps he should stick to his day job. But in all seriousness, the jersey presents some interesting questions: Will it be easier for fans to “bandwagon”? Can players switch jerseys mid-game? Will Drake be first in line for this new prop?Meanwhile, Twitter had all of the jokes.Jersey cost only 20 easy installments of, $999.99.— Vod Kanockers (@JHoward2716) February 15, 2019Kevin Durant can now switch teams mid game with these new #NBA jerseys 😳 pic.twitter.com/a01rMkiexr— OT Sports Podcast Network (@OTSportsPod) February 15, 2019This could go one of two ways: Either the NBA will have found another way to separate itself from the other sports leagues or it will be a pointless feature that exists just because there is the technology to make it happen and for Twitter to crack jokes. In any case, you have to admit the NBA never fails to entertain.More from Yahoo Sports: • Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight When spring training camps opened this week around Major League Baseball, it brought hope that maybe, finally, Bryce Harper and Manny Machado would sign with teams and baseball’s long free-agent freeze would melt away.Nope. Not yet. Not only has that not happened, something else did happen: a number of talented young players around the league have agreed to team-friendly contract extensions.The latest was New York Yankees ace Luis Severino, who on Friday reportedly agreed to a four-year, $40 million deal. The deal, first reported by Joel Sherman of the New York Post, would buy up Severino’s arbitration years and comes with a $15 million club option for his first year of free agency.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]By agreeing to this deal, the Yankees and Severino avoid arbitration for 2019. He’ll make $4 million this season, $10 million next, then $10.25 million in 2021 and $11 million in 2022. The club option is for 2023. In the grand scheme of society, this is a very generous contract. In baseball’s economic bubble, it’s another young player signing for below-market value relative to his skills and potential.It’s hard to blame Severino for taking the deal, looking around at a free-agent world where Harper and Machado are still available, as are Dallas Keuchel and Craig Kimbrel. Especially since we haven’t heard even slight grumblings about teams being interested in Keuchel and Kimbrel.Coming off a breakout season in which he went 19-8 with a 3.39 ERA, the 25-year-old Severino was given a deal that’s pretty hard to turn down: “Do you want $40 million guaranteed, yes or no?”The other players faced with a similar question this week were Philadelphia Phillies ace Aaron Nola, who said yes to a four-year, $45 million deal Wednesday. It also avoided arbitration and bought out two of Nola’s free agency years, making it the most below-market deal of any of these.The Minnesota Twins locked up two of their talented young players Thursday, as right fielder Max Kepler agreed to a five-year, $35 million deal with a $10 million club option for 2024. It buys out three years of free agency for Kepler, 26. Shortstop Jorge Polanco also agreed to a five-year extension, his is worth $25.75 million with two option years that could keep him in Minnesota through 2025.In a vacuum, these types of extensions look like win-wins: The players get guaranteed money as they’re coming off good seasons. The clubs get cost-certainty to help them navigate the future — whether it’s the Yankees and Phillies trying to add big free agents this year or next, or a team like the Twins striving for contention with a homegrown core.In a bigger sense, though, it’s hard not to look at these deals in the current state of free agency and wonder if they’re a symptom of something else. Is it the market correcting itself? Is it baseball’s economy morphing into something new? Or maybe it’s just players looking around and saying, “Well, I better get my money now.”According to numerous reports, there’s a fear that for this generation of young players the light at the end of the tunnel — the big free-agency payday — won’t be there for them in the same way it was for so many other players.So while it’s great that stars like Justin Verlander, Clayton Kershaw and Max Scherzer are publicly speaking out about the current state of free agency, they’re on the right side of it. They got their mega deals.The younger players find themselves in a different sort of peril. It’s entirely possible that these are the biggest paydays these players ever get, which is a much different economic model that we’ve seen from baseball in the past.Whether it’s right or wrong — and that’s certainly something that’s up for debate heading into the next collective-bargaining agreement — baseball’s economy has often been backward. Players get paid less, relative to the market, in their pre-free agency years. The best recent example is Mike Trout winning the MVP in 2014 at age 22 while making $1 million.He got a raise to $6 million the next season, but in 2015 was still making a fraction of what people like Ryan Howard ($25M), Albert Pujols ($24M), Joe Mauer ($23M), Mark Teixeira ($22.5M) and Jose Reyes ($22M) were making.But that overpay is a necessary part baseball’s economic ecosystem too. It’s a fact: Players get overpaid as their careers decline. It’s almost like baseball’s way of making up for underpaying players during their early years. It’s baseball’s golden parachute. What’s happening these days is fewer teams are accepting that overpay as part of the how the system works.In the past few years, arbitration salaries have gotten higher and higher, and teams have tried harder to lock up younger stars before free agency. It’s why we’ve see players like Madison Bumgarner, Chris Archer, Chris Sale and Paul Goldschmidt become valuable trade chips for their team-friendly contract extensions.Teams are getting smarter about where their money goes, and how to keep value in their assets. These extensions to Severino, Nola and the rest show that they’re willing to spend money, just in the way that they want.Earlier this week, former Miami Marlins president David Samson tweeted something in response to Justin Verlander, saying the “broken system” talk was wrong. Players and their agents, Samson said, needed to adjust to a “new reality.”He may be right about the new reality part. The monster paydays at the end of the free agency tunnel could be fading away. If Bryce Harper and Manny Machado can’t get them, who can?The new reality could be players seizing their money. Whenever they can.– – – – – –Mike Oz is a writer at Yahoo Sports.

However, Wainwright framed the situation with a little more urgency on Friday by expressing concerns that a day of reckoning could happen sooner than later.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]Speaking to InsideSTL.com’s Tim McKernan, Wainwright said it was inevitable that the players will go on strike unless major changes are made to help bridge the widening gap. But he’s also worried that frustrations could reach a boiling point during the season leading to some form of a revolt. Perhaps even a mid-season walkout.#STLCards pitcher Adam Wainwright on @TMASTL: “Unless something changes, there’s going to be a strike. 100%. I’m just worried people are going to walk-out mid-season.” pic.twitter.com/M8WeRVcASe— Tim McKernan (@tmckernan) February 15, 2019“Unless something changes, there’s going to be a strike. 100%,” Wainwright said regarding the free-agent freeze that has left stars like Bryce Harper and Manny Machado without contracts. “I’m just worried people are going to walkout midseason.”It’s conceivable given the current climate, but a players revolt on that level still feels like a long shot. The target date we should all still be looking at is Dec. 1, 2021. That’s when the current collective bargaining agreement ends and the owners will be forced to come to the table.That doesn’t mean we should just dismiss Wainwright’s concerns about a 2019 strike. While they might feel a little on the dramatic side, the frustration that has built all offseason as dozens of free agents, including and especially Harper and Machado, remain unsigned is becoming more palpable by the day. There’s a genuine feeling that owners are determined to cut back on salaries even as profits continue to reach new heights, it’s possible the players’ patience will run out if the free-agent freeze continues to drag on. Wainwright thinks so, and he’s far from alone.In Friday’s interview, the 37-year-old right-hander also criticized owners and front offense personnel for placing too much emphasis on “analytics” and placing everything in a “sabermetric box” that discounts intangibles and other immeasurable aspects of baseball.Adam Wainwright said today on ⁦@TMASTL⁩ that he expects there to be a strike “100%.”The context of the conversation comes from a discussion on how Bryce Harper and Manny Machado are still without teams.You can see Wainwright’s reasoning in the video below. pic.twitter.com/GXsmx4cXk1— Tim McKernan (@tmckernan) February 15, 2019Wainwright admitted that there’s always risk in making long-term financial commitments to players, but emphasized that doing so marks a commitment to winning that several teams seemingly lack.“Part of it is smart from their side of it, but you have to realize it’s about winning. So, if Bryce Harper wants 10 years and he’s 26 years old. He’s going to be a dynamic player. The same can be said about Manny Machado. These guys are superstar players.”The deeper we get into it the more obvious it is that the players know what battles lie ahead. The only real question is how much worse it will get before any progress is made toward a satisfactory resolution.More from Yahoo Sports:• Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight MLB rumors: Bryce Harper has made his decision, says D.C. radio host originally appeared on nbcsportsbayarea.comA report has come out from the East Coast saying Bryce Harper has come to a decision on which team he will play for in 2019 and beyond.Chris Russell, a sports radio talk show host from 106.7 The Fan in Washington D.C., (who has been on the Harper beat for some time) said the free agent slugger could make a decision in the next 24 hours.\"Maybe I took a little bit of a leap of faith here based on some indications I got from a real good source,\" Russell told 94WIP, in Philadelphia, on Friday.\"Bryce and his representatives, (Scott) Boras, his people, his wife Kayla, they've been meeting since Monday morning in Vegas. Bryce originally wanted this done, when it took this long, by Valentine's Day. Obviously, the contract has not been announced, signed, or whatever.\"\"But I'm led to believe by the people that I've talked to that are close to the situation -- and I have, again, a real good source that has helped me through this process, let's just leave it at that,\" Russell said. \"That Bryce was in a mood to celebrate yesterday. Now, the source said, 'I believe it's done.' I don't have concrete, 100 percent proof for you guys. I wish I did, otherwise, I would have it and I would be running around with it. But I don't have that, so I want to caution everybody in Philadelphia. But that's what I was led to believe, that this thing is now decided.\"Russell then mentioned the Phillies.\"Now, what comes then is hammering out a contract. And if we were to believe the report that the Philadelphia Phillies had not even extended a formal offer -- and I assume that to be a termed, written agreement, that type of thing, which I find hard to believe -- then there might be more legwork to this. And therefore, hey the decision may be done, but the contract still needs to be ironed out.\"[RELATED: Phillies fan participates in \"lent\" in hopes of recruiting Harper]Russell is being safe with the terminology he's using, which is understandable. And while we haven't been able to confirm these rumors, Harper, along with many other free agents, remains unsigned.The Giants appeared to be the \"mystery team\" that introduced themselves late into the Harper sweepstakes -- and when the radio hosts asked Russell his opinion on where the outfielder will end up next season, he believed Harper will be in an orange and black uniform.\"I don't think it's going to be the Nationals,\" Russell said. \"I think it's going to be the San Francisco Giants, but that is not by any means an 'I know that for a fact,' so I want to caution everybody -- I know how this works -- I get in trouble with everything I say on my radio show, and everyone blows it up.\" The wait continues ... Golden State Warriors stars Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant empathised with Steve Kerr after the head coach was ejected during the loss to the Portland Trail Blazers having thrown a clipboard in response to a flagrant foul call.Kerr was enraged late in the fourth quarter when Draymond Green was called for a flagrant foul after he stopped Zach Collins from approaching the rim as he went up for a shot.That drew Kerr's ire and after ranting in one referee's face, he slammed a clipboard down to earn an ejection, with Durant having to escort his head coach back off the court.The Warriors lost the game 129-107 but will still head into the All-Star break with the best record in the Western Conference.\"It was an emotional game. We fought really hard for 43 minutes,\" Curry told reporters afterwards.\"One questionable decision - the flagrant - obviously the fire came out. You see coach go and throw a clipboard. At that point you try to get us over the hump. An eight-point swing, it's tough to overcome.\"\"I looked at the replay and the amount of ball [Green] got, there was nothing excessive about it, he got all the ball.\"There was a lot of chirping, with Zach involved. There was probably a sensitivity to it, trying to put out some fires, but I thought it was a terrible call. We obviously paid the price for it with how everything unfolded after that.\"Durant shared that sympathy having been the one to pull Kerr away from the referees as he continued to rant at them.\"I felt for him, I understand his anger and his rage, especially for that call,\" he said.\"I thought we should have just kept playing, It was a common foul, I thought. Refs looked at it differently. \"I understand why coach was a little frustrated.\"Kerr explained that it was the disbelief at the call that had triggered his reaction.\"I was just shocked that that was called a flagrant foul,\" he said. \"I'm not sure how it's determined - if it's in New York or the officials on the call - but that was head-scratching: that that could be called a flagrant foul.\"The guy's going to go in for a dunk, you've got to make sure he doesn't dunk it.\"So, I told Kenny [Mauer] that I beg to differ. There might have been a couple of other words in there too!\"I'll have to ask the owner if the clipboard broke when I threw it down. I got a little anger out so that was good. I was too busy yelling to ask for an explanation.\"Charles Barkley thinks New Orleans Pelicans star Anthony Davis made a mistake with his trade request.The 25-year-old asked the Pelicans to move him in late January and the Los Angeles Lakers had been engaged in discussions about acquiring him. But, no deal was reached before the deadline and Davis remained with New Orleans.Barkley, an 11-time All-Star who works as an analyst for TNT, said he thinks Davis and his agent, Rich Paul, mishandled the situation.\"Don't ruin your reputation as a great player, one of the nicest guys in the world,\" Barkley told reporters on Thursday ahead of All-Star weekend (via the Washington Post).\"Remember, your agent works for you, you don't work for him. They handled that situation wrong. It's going to come back to bite them in the a***. It's unfortunate.\"The six-time All-Star entered play on Thursday averaging 28.5 points and 13.1 rebounds this season. But, he scored just three points in 24 minutes on the floor in the Pelicans' 118-88 loss to the Orlando Magic earlier this week.\"This is a bad situation,\" Barkley said. \"It's a bad look for the NBA. Because that kid can't go out there and give 100 per cent because he’s worried about getting hurt. The guy's the second-best player in the world and he's got three points? That's not a good look for the NBA.\"The Boston Celtics and New York Knicks, among others, are expected to explore dealing for Davis after the season. Barkley, however, said he believes the forward will eventually land in Los Angeles because of Paul's relationship with Lakers star LeBron James.Barkley tallied 22.1 points and 11.7 rebounds per game over his 16-year career. He retired in 2000 and was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame six years later.After an apology from Sergio Garcia, a non-apology from Matt Kuchar, and an uncooperative Mother Nature on Valentine's Day, it's time for everyone to focus again on Tiger Woods. Kidding. Sort of. A weather-delayed first round at Riviera re-starts on Friday morning and the 14-time major champ will be in the Hollywood-area spotlight as he finally begins his Genesis Open. And golf fans could potentially see a LOT of the tournament host as the event tries to play catch up after heavy rains on Thursday.Woods, Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas (Decent group, eh?) are scheduled to tee off at 8:32 local time (11:32 ET). The hope is they will complete their first rounds and then play as much of their second rounds as possible before darkness. And Tiger's hope is to finally win for the first time at this historic layout where he missed the cut last year. We'll be tracking Tiger every step of the way so keep it right here for the latest scores, news and highlights. (All times eastern)SATURDAY, 11:25: With a 25-foot birdie putt on No. 9, Woods' final hole of the second round, Tiger will likely make the cut. The birdie brought Woods back to even on his round and to one under overall.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096808527694245890After resuming play in the morning, Woods bogeyed his first hole, No. 4, then made four pars before his finishing birdie. His playing partners, however, fared much better. Justin Thomas shares the lead with Adam Scott at 11 under and Rory McIlroy birdied four of his six holes on Saturday morning to shoot 63 and move to seven under through 36 holes. Thursday's early wave is now on the course for their second rounds.-------------------FRIDAY-------------------8:25: And with that, the horn has sounded—play will be suspended for darkness on Friday at Riviera. Tiger, JT and Rory have six more holes to complete their second round. Justin Thomas is at 10-under, tied with Adam Scott for the lead. Tiger will hope Saturday brings some different momentum for him—as this marathon day ends with two bogeys in a row after the highlight eagle.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10965708926692065298:21: That's back-to-back bogeys now for Tiger Woods, dropping another shot here at the third hole (his 12th of the round). And over his past six holes, Tiger has four bogeys. The birdie at No. 1 helped negate most of that damage ... but Tiger's back to 1-under again—right on the current cut line.8:13: On his 30th hole of the day, Tiger is showing some obvious signs of being tired. And who could blame him—he's been playing golf for nearly 10 hours straight. From 165 yards out at the third hole, Tiger Woods tries to chop out a 6-iron and comes out of it. His ball comes to rest short of the green. With sunset in Pacific Palisades being 5:30 local time, this group will have time for maybe one more hole today.8:04: Tiger follows up that eagle putt at No. 1 with a bogey at the second hole. The third bogey of his second round moves Tiger back to 2-under overall.7:56: After a long wait at the second hole, Tiger sprays his second shot from 235 out with a fairway wood out to the right. He'll have his work cut out from the front right bunker to save par at the 482-yard par 4.7:40: This is exactly what Tiger Woods needed: He rolls in his 43-foot eagle putt at his 10th hole (the first) to get back to 3-under—negating those two bogeys he made on his front nine. What a putt! With the flagstick in!https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096570892669206529Tiger made a disappointing par to open his first round earlier today at the first hole. The unlikely eagle makes up for that effort—and could turn around Tiger's second round in a dramatic way. Tiger goes from toeing the cut line at 1-under to now all of a sudden being T-21.7:28: Tiger finds the fairway at the par-5 first hole, the group's 10th hole of their second round, as he attempts to get a shot back here after bogeying two of his final three holes on his front nine. Neither bogey was particularly bad—the 18th hole is playing brutally tough right now uphill and into the wind with the rain, making it even more of a challenging hole. And his break at 16 was very unlucky.7:16: Tiger and JT are gonna have their work cut out to save par at the 18th hole (their ninth). Each player had fairway wood approaches and tried playing a big cut. JT was way up left on the hill—Tiger was closer. He went high with his approach and will have about 11 feet left for par.Tiger misses the par putt, so he'll drop a shot along with JT as they make the turn. Tiger moves back to 1-under after 27 holes. That's where the cut line currently is—so all of a sudden, Tiger must be concerned about making the cut.7:01: Following Justin Thomas throwing a dart at the 17th to about 3 feet, Tiger puts his wedge shot from under 100 yards to outside 20 feet, so he'll be disappointed with that effort. The birdie putt misses on the high side, and Tiger taps in for par to remain at 2-under. His playing partner and buddy Justin Thomas stays hot, rolling in a fourth straight birdie to get to 9-under—tied for the lead with Adam Scott. Really impressive golf here from JT.6:54: The rain is really coming down now as the players head to the 17th hole. Tiger finds the fairway at the par-5 17th hole, but it was a short one—he has 326 yards left. Most players have been laying up at this par 5 all day.6:43: From a brutal position up against the back lip of the bunker, Tiger hacks it out—and somehow keeps the ball on the green, albeit the back portion. His par attempt from 44 feet away here comes up three feet shy. Tiger makes his bogey to move back to 2-under.Meanwhile, Justin Thomas is officially on fire. He has another birdie after a fabulous tee shot at 16. It's now two Kentucky boys tied at the top: Justin Thomas and J.B. Holmes (-8).https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10965576791939317766:39: Tiger will have serious lie issues at the par-3 16th hole. His tee shot came to rest up against the back lip of the bunker. As Billy Kratzert just remarked on PGA Tour Live, Tiger will do well just to keep this ball on the green. Though he avoided dropping a shot on his last hole, there might be a bogey in his future here.6:35: A clutchhh par save by Tiger at the 15th hole makes up for his poor chip—and Tiger keeps the momentum going on his second round, as he stays 3-under for the tournament and 2-under on the round.Justin Thomas, also in Tiger's group, holed out from in front of the green for birdie at the 14th hole, and he makes a long birdie putt at 15 to get to 7-under—just one back of fellow Kentucky native J.B. Holmes.6:32: A poor chip shot from Tiger at the 15th hole leaves him about 13 feet away. He'll need to convert that putt to prevent dropping his first shot of his second round.6:24: Tiger finds another fairway here at Riviera, this one at the 15th hole. The guy is feeeling it with his driver. Almost on auto pilot. His approach from 190 out turns a little too much, finding the rough to the left of the green. He'll have to get up and down to avoid dropping one here.6:20: From 20 feet out, Tiger's birdie bid comes up shy—never really scaring the hole, despite getting a good look at the line from Rory's putt. Tiger taps in for par to remain at 3-under.The putter has been disappointing for Tiger all day: He had 34 putts in his first round, including four three-putts, just the third time in his career he's done that.6:13: Tiger puts his tee shot at the par-3 14th hole just inside Rory's ball—about 20 feet right of the hole. He'll get a little teach from Rory's putt, too, as Tiger continues to hit it well today.6:07: Tiger just misses the left-to-right curling bid for birdie, leaving himself with an easy par at 13. He stays 3-under for the tournament and -2 through four on his round.Tiger's playing partners are also playing well—Rory has three birdies in his first four holes to get to 2-under. Look out for Rory at rainy Riviera. And Justin Thomas, despite hitting his tee shot out of bounds at 13, got up and down from 160 yards to avoid dropping multiple shots. He's now 5-under after that bogey.6:02: Another grooved tee shot for Tiger Woods at the 13th hole puts him in good position. He turned over his tee shot—putting his draw in the middle of the fairway at the dogleg left. Tiger spins his approach back to about 15 feet, just off the green in the fringe. He'll have a chance to knock another one here and keep the momentum going.5:51: Bang! Tiger nails the 25-footer for birdie at the 12th hole to add a second birdie to his card through three holes. Realistically, too, it could be three straight birdies for Tiger. But the 14-time major champion is now 2-under through 3—T-3 for the tournament (T-19)—and carries some strong momentum on his side at the start of his second round ... as the rain is coming down at Riviera.5:46: Tiger hits his approach hole high—about 25 feet from 181 yards. He'll have another chance to add a birdie to his third round.Tiger's currently at 2-under, which puts him at T-29. The projected cut is at 1-under—so he's comfortably inside the number as of now. But there's a ton of golf to be played, obviously.5:41: Tiger finds the fairway with his driver at the par-4 12th hole. The 12th usually plays as one of the toughest holes at Riviera—we'll see if Tiger can take advantage of his position here in the fairway.5:33: An excellent fairway-wood second shot by Tiger put him right in front of the par-5 11th green in two. But a very poor approach putt for his third leaves him more than 10 feet away. His birdie try slides by for a very disappointing par being so close in 2. That should've been a golden opportunity to start his second round with two birdies—instead, Tiger stays at 2-under.5:12: Tiger goes high with his pitch—having to navigate around the front bunker, and plays it nicely—spinning it about 7 feet short of the hole. So Tiger will have a good look for an opening birdie to start his second round. Tiger converts the birdie putt to move to 2-under.5:02: Only a little more than a half hour after finishing his first round, Tiger Woods (-1) -- along with Justin Thomas (-5) and Rory McIlroy (+1) -- has teed off in his second round. The group started on the drivable 10th hole, and Tiger has driven his tee shot just off the green. He'll have a chance to put his pitch shot close to start his second round with a birdie.4:24: Tiger narrowly misses the birdie putt at the 18th hole, so he'll tap in for a par and an opening-round, one-under 70 at Riviera. Having three-putted for a fourth time on the 17th hole to drop a shot in disappointing fashion, Tiger will head to his second round a bit frustrated. But the four consecutive birdies showed him being able to score well at Riviera, where he has never won.Tiger, JT (who birdied 18 to finish at 5-under) and Rory will head right back for their second round in this marathon day for them.4:18: Tiger responds to that shocking three-putt with a perfect drive and a towering 6-iron on Riviera's famed 18th. Woods is in good shape to at least make par the difficult hole, but as we've seen all day, a two-putt is anything but automatic.Here's an unusual stat on Tiger three-putting four times this afternoon. He's making some history in a bad way...https://twitter.com/JustinRayGolf/status/10965196250582507574:06: So much for the momentum. . . After a decent approach shot that spins back to about 20 feet, Woods runs his birdie putt a couple feet by and. . . gulp. . . misses the comebacker from about two feet. Wow. That's four three-putts on the day as Tiger falls back to one under with one hole to play.3:57: Uh-oh, it's raining in southern California again. Meanwhile, Woods is plodding his way up the par-5 17th. After pulling his drive into the left rough and drawing a poor lie, Woods pushed his layup slightly into the first cut of the right rough. He'll have a some sort of wedge to a back-right hole location.3:50: Tiger's tee shot was tracking on the par-3 16th, but it comes up about 30 feet short. From there, he two-putts for par to remain at two under. Justin Thomas makes his 10-foot birdie effort to move to four under, while Rory McIlroy remains at one over. McIlroy hast two holes to avert his first over-par score of 2019.3:40: After another great drive and a solid approach, Woods races his birdie attempt nearly five feet past the hole. But he keeps the overall positive momentum going by converting the par putt to remain at two under. Tiger has three more holes to play. At least, before he gets a lunch break.3:24: BANG! There's the bounce back from Tiger. It just came one hole later. And from farther away as Woods drains his 12-footer for birdie on No. 14.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096507996031467520Woods is now back to two under, five shots behind Jordan Spieth, who has to be pleased to still be in front by two despite these soft conditions.3:17: Tiger hits a great shot on the difficult par-3 14th hole to about 15 feet. He'll have a good look at birdie coming up. In the meantime, here's a look at how the leader board stands with Jordan Spieth still leading the way.Jordan Spieth (-7) 2t. Tony Finau (-5) 2t. Patrick Rodgers (-5) 2t. Kramer Hickok (-5) 2t. Davis Love III (-5) 2t. Adam Scott (-5) 2t. J.B. Homes (-5)Click here for full scores.3:13: Woods stuck his approach to about four feet below the hole on No. 13. A bounce back birdie looked like a forgone conclusion until he pushed his effort. Woof. That's two three-putts and two short misses on the greens for Tiger today. He remains at one under. Meanwhile, Rory McIlroy, after getting to two under through eight, has fallen to one over after back-to-back bogeys. Justin Thomas, the third player in the group, continues to lead this trio at three under.3:05: After hitting fade after fade, Woods steps to the 13th tee and rips a draw around the corner, perfectly setting up his next shot. Good to see him working it both ways with ease.3:01: Tiger pushed his tee shot into the right rough, then hit a fantastic recovery shot from a thick lie onto the green. He had a long look at birdie that rolled about four feet past, leaving him with a tricky left-to-right par putt, which he missed. That's three three putts on the day for Woods, and he's still one under.2:39: Not the best chip from Woods, as he left himself about six feet for birdie, but he makes it anyway. Four straight for Tiger to get to two under for the day.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10964952191957975042:30: Woods rips a 3-wood from 269 to just in front of the green. Hate to jinx him, but there's no reason he shouldn't easily make his fourth straight birdie here (ducks).2:20: Three in a row for Woods as he rolls in another at No. 10 and moves to one under. If he finds the fairway again at the 11th, four in a row will be in his sights. Meanwhile, Rory makes his par to stay at one under and JT ends up holing his 10 footer for birdie to get to four under. Finally a little bit of JUICE from this threesome.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096489287753711616https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096489787672780800By the way, it looks like we know when they'll be heading back out for round two later today. Here's an update from the Tiger Tracker:https://twitter.com/GCTigerTracker/status/1096481806067523585That should give them enough time to get at least 11 or 12 holes in.At the 11th, Woods stripes another drive down the fairway. He's really starting to cook.2:12: Tiger's shot was a tad more difficult than we thought, as he had to avoid a bunker and take it up high to get it back to the pin. He was successful, sticking it to about three feet. Hell of a shot. Even better was Rory's shot, as he flopped it from a nice lie and got it to hang on just off the back of the green and stay out of the back bunker. Thomas, who had the easiest shot, put too much spin on his chip, leaving himself with about 10 feet for birdie.2:07: Finally, Tiger, Rory and JT hit their tee shots, and it looks like the ensuing entertainment will be well worth the wait. Tiger is in the collection area left of the green, where he has a straightforward chip that should set him up with a good chance to make birdie. Thomas is just in front of the green, and he'll have a great chance to make a birdie as well. Rory ... um ... not so much. He's in the rough with a greenside bunker in front of him and a pin he won't be able to get close to, and just holding the green would be a miracle.1:52: Woods drains his four-footer for bird and turns in even par 35. Real strong finish to his opening nine, and now it looks like he'll have a long wait at the 10th. DeChambeau, Kuchar and Rahm have still yet to hit their tee shots.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10964831254067896321:47: Tiger had just 122 left to the green and stuck one in there close. He has four feet left for birdie to turn in even par, which would be a small victory after that ugly three putt back at No. 7. Not to mention he'll have a prime opportunity to get into red figures at the driveable par-4 10th.1:41: Woods cranks another high fade right down the middle with the driver at No. 9. With the tees up today, he'll have a low iron in his hand for his approach.1:34: And he's on the board! Woods bounces back with a birdie putt from 15 feet, getting him back to one over. We'll see if that gets him going before making the turn.1:30: From 125 yards out, Woods hit a wedge and hated it from the second he made contact. While he did pull it, he's still hole high and inside 20 feet. Hideki Matsuyama-esque move from Tiger.1:24: Woods rips one right down the middle at the par-4 eighth. Should have a short iron in.1:15: Tiger's birdie putt was actually from just off the green on the fringe, and he rolled it by some four feet. Then, he missed the comebacker for par, dropping to two over on the day. Oof.1:09: Fairway and a green for Woods at the seventh. Good look at birdie coming up to get back to level par.12:58: Another hole, another par for Woods, who two-putted from 24 feet on the par-3 sixth. In the group up ahead, though, Jon Rahm is making a move at three under through six.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/109646557828021452912:47: Another meh hole for Tiger on No. 5, just missing the fairway with his tee shot, finding the front of the green with a so-so approach, and two-putting for another par from 43 feet. Woods remains at one over through five holes while his playing partners, McIlroy and Thomas, both remain at one under.12:42: As Matt Kuchar's ball is in the air on the par-3 sixth, a fan yells, \"Go low—just not with the gratuity!\" Despite Matt maintaining this is \"not a story,\" it is. And this won't be the last comment like this.12:29: Woods hit a nice shot to about 15 feet on the par-3 fourth, but ran his birdie effort by the hole. Still one over. Still no highlights. At least, from Tiger. Here was Spieth's closing birdie from about an hour ago, because there is not much else exciting going on right now.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/109644546143346688112:17: Another missed fairway and another short approach from Tiger on the par-4 third. Although, Woods found the putting surface, he was unable to two-putt from 63 feet, missing a seven-footer for par after badly misreading his first putt. That drops Tiger to one over through three holes. Not a lot of highlights so far. . .12:02: Tiger misses right off the tee on No. 2 then comes up short on another approach. But his pitch shot nearly goes down, leaving him with a tap-in par. Even par through two holes.11:49: After that perfect opening tee shot, Tiger hit a hideous approach with a 5-iron that came up way short in a fairway bunker. From there, he hit his third to 10 feet but missed the putt to walk away with a disappointing par. Both of Tiger's playing partners, McIlroy and Thomas, make birdie.11:38: Matt Kuchar just misses his eagle attempt from 25 feet on No. 1, but taps in for birdie. Kuchar has been in the news a lot this week over a caddie controversy dating back to his win at the Mayakoba Golf Classic. A controversy he didn't help with his comments on Wednesday. Is it possible some of those \"Kuuuuch\" shouts will turn to \"Mooooch\"? Kinda sounded like it on the first hole. . .11:34: Jordan Spieth is in with a seven-under-par 64 to take the early lead. Spieth needed only 21 putts during his bogey-free round. Of course, starting tournaments hasn't been a problem for Spieth of late. Finishing, however, has been a different story. Incredibly, Spieth is looking for his first win since the 2017 British Open and his first top 5 since last year's Masters.11:32: Woods smashes a driver off the first tee that finds the fairway. The opening par 5 at Riviera is essentially a long par 4 and one of the easiest holes on the PGA Tour all year so Tiger is thinking at least birdie after that tee shot.10:53: So far, so good on the Friday weather:https://twitter.com/GCTigerTracker/status/1096437235262533632And with lift, clean and place in play (for at least the first round), low scores are out there. Let's set the over/under on the Par-71 layout at 68.5.10:45: We are approximately 45 minutes away from Tiger's tee time and it's another major champ who is already off to a fantastic start. Jordan Spieth has the lead at six under through 15 holes. Spieth leads Patrick Rodgers by one and then there's a big group at four under, including Bill Haas, who is playing in the event a year after being involved in a car accident during last year's tournament that killed a friend he was staying with. Make sure you read Brian Wacker's piece from earlier in the week on how Haas is still trying to move on from that tragedy.10:35: As we move within an hour from Tiger teeing off, check out GOLFTV's latest behind-the-scenes video with Woods in which he says his bag has up to 16(!) golf gloves during rainy rounds and he explains why he doesn't like wearing rain jackets:https://twitter.com/GOLFTV/status/1096246456795697153\"Pops used to say, 'Once you're wet, you're wet.

Once he started running the front office, his blinking at Paul George on national TV contributed to the Lakers getting fined again for tampering. Johnson’s praise of Giannis Antetokounmpo drew yet another tampering fine.So, though he escaped punishment for his recent comments on 76ers guard Ben Simmons, Johnson refused to answer a question about Hornets guard Kemba Walker.Carolina Blitz:Asked Magic about Kemba and he said y’all aren’t going to catch him slipping anymore. pic.twitter.com/sQZtIWnQbn— Carolina Blitz (@KeepBlitzin) February 15, 2019Johnson:You know I can’t answer any questions about no players, because every time I do it, I get fined. But anybody else do it, they don’t get fined. So I’m going to stay away from that one.I don’t blame Johnson for feeling that way.Other teams’ owners, coaches and executives have repeatedly publicly discussed rival players without facing announced punishment.To be fair, the NBA doesn’t reveal every fine. Bucks owner Marc Lasry reportedly just got fined for tampering, but the league never announced it. But, at minimum, there’s an inconsistency with how the NBA exposes Johnson’s transgressions.Even NBA commissioner Adam Silver said last year there’s a spotlight on the Lakers due to prior tampering. That strikes me as unfair. The Lakers already paid for their prior violations and should now be held to the same standard as everyone else.And for what it’s worth, I wish that standard allowed an all-time great point guard like Johnson to publicly share his thoughts on Kemba Walker.Gareth Bale has landed himself in hot water after La Liga denounced the Real Madrid star for his celebration in the Madrid derby, which could carry a ban of four to 12 games.The Welsh forward scored as a substitute in the 3-1 victory over Atletico Madrid, bringing up his 100th goal for the club.And during the celebrations that followed, Bale \"lifted his right arm near his head in a clear sign of provocation towards the fans, then giving a gesture which could be seen as obscene and disdainful by folding his arm and striking it with his other hand.\"In a statement released by La Liga, Bale’s punishment will be decided by whether he incited the crowd or not.If Bale is guilty of “inciting opposition fans” to cause a hostile reaction, the punishment could carry four to 12 games, if there was no hostile reaction but intent, then it could be as little as one to three games.The gesture is referred to in Spain as ‘corte de mangas,’ with the moment not picked up in the referee’s match report.A committee will now decide whether the gesture merits a punishment.Bale also featured in Real’s Champions League victory over Ajax.Los Blancos take a 2-1 lead back to the Bernabeu for the second leg of the last 16 tie after Marco Asensio’s late winner.Earlier this week Heisman Trophy winner — and first round draft pick of the Oakland Athletics — Kyler Murray chose football over baseball, committing himself to the NFL draft.

In the last month alone he's won his 44th PGA Tour event, finished second in another, hit every fairway in a round for the first time in 21 years, shot a 60, pulled off this impossible recovery shot, gone viral just by rolling his eyes and said he might drop the Players from his schedule because he's already won it (a literal mic drop). The man simply cannot be stopped right now.Leave it to the weather to literally rain on Lefty's parade. On Thursday at the Genesis Open, Mickelson began his first round at the difficult short par-4 10th and drove into one of the bunkers up near the green, leaving him with a dreaded lengthy sand shot. He wound up hitting it over the green, and his ball plugged in the back bunker, setting up an even harder shot than he just had. As you'll hear PGA Tour Live commentator Shane Bacon say, avoiding making a six was probably the goal, but after Mickelson hit his third into another bunker on the other side of the green, a six suddenly became best-case scenario. How does a four sound instead?https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096076528142626818Find us a more Phil Mickelson par ever... you can't. He's always got a flair for the dramatic. The problem?

(Old man golfers)The dust is barely settled in the wake of the end of the Markelle Fultz era in Philadelphia, and the former 76ers guard is already taking shots at his old team.His old coach Brett Brown in particular.Fultz had his introductory press conference with the Orlando Magic on Thursday after being traded at last week’s deadline and praised his new coach Steve Clifford while taking a veiled shot at Brown.“It just excites me to know that I have a coach that’s going to push you to be better and not just going to tell you what you want to hear,” Fultz said.That’s direct praise for his new coach. But the message for Brown is clear. Fultz didn’t like what he heard from the Philadelphia coaching staff.Fultz never had any public dispute with the 76ers, but it was evident that he and the team had different approaches to the struggles that saw him shoot 41.4 percent from the field, 26.7 percent from 3-point distance and 53.4 percent from the line in limited action after being selected as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2017 draft.It’s still not clear whether injury or a mental block – or both – are the cause of his shooting issues.After his agent announced that the nerve disorder thoracic outlet syndrome was the root of the shooting woes, Fultz never played again for the 76ers.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]Fultz appears to be fully embracing the fresh start in Orlando as a player and a person.“I think the biggest thing we talked about what doing thing the right way,” Fultz said. “Just building me up both as a man and on the court. I think that’s music to my ears, really just. Two things I really want to do is be the best player I can be and be the best young man I can be.”Fultz described the experience of his nerve disorder to reporters.“It’s hard to lift up your arms, you lose feeling in your fingers,” Fultz said. “You can’t tell when it’s going to happen. It’s not like you do the same motion every time. You get tingling in your fingers, numbness. Stuff like that.”He also curtly dismissed any notion that his shooting struggles are due to anything but injury.“I had an injury,” Fultz said. “I was out there trying to play through that. I never lost confidence.”Asked about a timetable to return, Fultz dodged the question to talk about rehab.“Right now it’s just about getting everything the right way,” he said. “Rehab’s been going great. I’m just taking my time and doing everything the right way.”More from Yahoo Sports: • PGA Tour pro defends paying caddie $5K on $1.3M win • NFL bars NCAA’s all-time sack leader from combine • Only one NBA team failed to scout Antetokounmpo • Black History honor for Kaepernick sacked by lawmakers He might not be well known to NFL fans at large, but New England Patriots fans know linebacker Kyle Van Noy — acquired basically for free from the Detroit Lions at the 2016 trade deadline — has been a big part of the defense the last two years, and has a knack for making plays at the right time.Van Noy is getting a little shine after winning his second Super Bowl ring with New England, appearing on the “Pardon My Take” podcast on Thursday to dish on all things Patriots and Super Bowl LIII.One thing that Van Noy revealed: the Los Angeles Rams didn’t do anything surprising during the game on offense.“I couldn’t believe that,” Van Noy said. “They really didn’t do — not one wrinkle. I was like, ‘What the hell?’ They’ve got so many good players, they’ve got so many things they’ve done all year, and the one play they gave us which was a wrinkle was the [Brandin] Cooks screen that hit for a little bit.“And that was it… Or maybe too, we were playing so good they were like, ‘[Expletive], we don’t know what to do.’ ”Hindsight, of course, is 20-20, but given that the Patriots’ coaching staff is known for having its players prepared for any and everything, it seems unwise that Los Angeles didn’t add some new plays or looks to try to stump New England.Van Noy said the Patriots’ culture, specifically coach Bill Belichick’s practice of not sparing anyone in the film room, even Tom Brady, is part of why the team continues to win.“Oh yeah. Yeah, that [stuff is] sick, to be honest, because it sets the table,” Van Noy said. “Like, OK, it doesn’t matter who you are, everyone’s on an even playing field. This is how it is here at work. You come in and you earn everything.“And I respect that because I felt like that gave me a chance to get on the field when I came in mid-year, and [Belichick] was like, ‘It doesn’t matter who you are or what you’ve done. You earn your keep.’ ”More from Yahoo Sports: • Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight The Brady Conundrum: How do you go about replacing the GOAT? originally appeared on nbcsportsboston.comThe Patriots hatched a Tom Brady succession plan after the 2013 season when they drafted Jimmy Garoppolo.Brady blew that up.Now, five years, four Super Bowl appearances, three Super Bowl wins, two Super Bowl MVPs and a regular-season MVP later, it's time to gingerly -- caaaauuuuuutiooooousssssllllyyyyy -- begin the process again.This time should be different.Even though Brady's contract hasn't been extended past the 2019 season, the love and happiness we saw on the field after the Rams were dispatched in SB53 is a good sign.MORE PATRIOTSAreas of Change: Will Pats be able to retain free agents Trey Flowers and Trent Brown?Brady's wariness about the Patriots' plans for him, and Bill Belichick's wariness about wedding his team to a quarterback who's closer to 50 years old than he is to 30, has dissipated.Once a new deal is in place -- Jonathan Kraft indicated that might be before training camp, though as of the Super Bowl conversations hadn't started -- Brady will have a written assurance that he will leave the Patriots and the NFL on his terms.That wasn't the case in early 2014 when the soon-to-be-37-year-old Brady saw the Patriots spend a first-round pick on a defensive tackle (Dominique Easley) and their second-rounder on Garoppolo. That, after a '13 season Brady spent throwing to the likes of Aaron Dobson, Josh Boyce, Kenbrell Thompkins and Austin Collie.Garoppolo was a stick of dynamite under Brady's behind. He was the existential threat Brady feared made flesh.Jimmy might have thought he was drafted to learn how to play quarterback in the NFL and have a nice career. To Brady, Garoppolo was there to take his job, throw his career into upheaval, uproot his family and see Brady cast out into the NFL wilderness.MORE PATRIOTSPerry: If Beckham is on the trade block, should Patriots be willing to pay the price?And, in contrast to the guy Brady succeeded in 2001 (and, by extension, did all those things to), Brady wasn't going to snort derisively at the plucky little draft pick here to take his job. He would crush the threat.He did.Brady played so well that -- despite Garoppolo developing into a bona-fide front-line quarterback under Belichick and Josh McDaniels (and Brady) -- Brady left the ever-prepared Patriots with no recourse when Garoppolo's contract was about to expire.Brady was too good to bench and too important to trade. Garoppolo was too expensive to franchise and too smart to take a \"bridge\" contract so he could watch Brady from the sidelines while his own hair started to gray at the temples. So off he went around Halloween, 2017.A lot's happened in the 16 months since.MORE PATRIOTSPhil Perry's Mock Draft 1.0: Pats start looking for Gronk's replacementBut now here we are, in the offseason of Brady's 42nd year. And the complex question of how to find the player who will eventually replace the greatest quarterback in NFL history still lingers.Do you draft his successor? If you do, do you do it this year? Do you do it next year?Do you try to get into the top 10 to get your pick of the litter? Do you stay put, confident that the muttonheads across the league will miss out as they did with Brady and Garoppolo (or Aaron Rodgers, Russell Wilson, Drew Brees, Brett Favre, Johnny Unitas . . . you get the point)? How much will it cost to get into the top 10? Do you package picks from this season -- when you will have six in the first three rounds -- and pick a sucker who will suck next year and fleece them for their 2020 first-rounder? How high do you have to go for a blue-chip, given the number of first-round quarterbacks that will be taken this year and that were taken in 2018?Is it a trade for somebody another team's given up on or has no work for, like San Francisco's Nick Mullens? A veteran who will hit free agency like Nick Foles, Case Keenum or Teddy Bridgewater?How does the successor play the position? Similar to Brady in that brain/eyes/accuracy/commitment trumps legs/arm strength/versatility?MORE PATRIOTSShould Pats be interested in Demaryius Thomas? No . . . and yesOr is there an embrace of the fact that trying to find a quarterback similar to a guy who came into the league after four years at Michigan at the end of last century with a once-in-a-lifetime work ethic is a pipe dream?Aside from who the successor is and how he plays, can Brady -- the lion in winter -- be tapped to help groom whoever is being brought aboard to take over?Brady -- contrary to sexed-up speculation -- didn't actively undermine Garoppolo at any point. They were teammates. He helped Garoppolo play the position better. They became close. But he wasn't quite showing him his world, either. Brady is famous for saying he's not giving away his secrets to younger quarterbacks until after he's done.With the end-date likely to be agreed upon when he signs an extension, does he become more a mentor so that the success of the franchise has a better chance to continue after he leaves? Would the Patriots want him to do that?Or would they want a blank(ish) slate to work with that isn't saying, \"But Tom said . . . \" when they try to shape him to succeed?And that contract? What's it look like? Does Brady demand pay commensurate with what he's accomplished? Is he in the mood to do the team another financial solid given the only bump they have him in 2018 was incentives he never reached? How does that impact the structure of the team?These questions aren't new. What is new is the level of angst and anxiousness. It's dissipated tremendously.That won't make finding his replacement or choosing the means by which the Patriots will do it any easier. But it's less fraught now.The irony is, the Patriots already successfully found Brady's successor. It's just that 2014 was too soon to go looking for him.Now, can they do it again?Click here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!

Before the team's loss to the Blazers on Wednesday night, he told ESPN that he \"wants to finish his career as a Warrior.\"      View this post on Instagram    Klay wants to stay in The Bay.A post shared by  espn (@espn) on Feb 13, 2019 at 9:23pm PSTThompson is set to be an unrestricted free agent at the end of the 2018-19 season.This isn't the first time Klay has made his feelings known. Even his father Mychal, who played five seasons for the Lakers, believes his son will re-sign with the Warriors. [RELATED: For Steve Kerr, Steph Curry and Klay Thompson are mix of NBA past and present]The Warriors selected Thompson with the No. 11 overall pick in the 2011 NBA Draft. Since then, he's been a five-time NBA All-Star, three-time Finals champion and two-time All-NBA selection. Anything could happen, but it's safe to say the Klay and the Dubs have quite the relationship and are ready to tie the knot.Jason Witten never worked with Kellen Moore as a coach, but he did practice with Moore when both of them were still active players with the Cowboys.That experience is enough for Witten to think Moore has “a way about him” that will pay off in his new job as the Cowboys offensive coordinator. Witten said this week that he believes Moore will be innovative and that the offense will take a “big step” by gearing things around quarterback Dak Prescott.“Yeah, I think he will do the things that Dak likes to do,” Witten said, via the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. “He will do the things they have to do to win. That is the way they have to play. I think they will use the pass to set up the run. Not just the run to set up the pass. I think he will add some nice wrinkles to that offense.”With head coach Jason Garrett coaching in the final year of his contract, Moore’s work with the offense will have a lot to do with how Dallas does in 2019 and with the path the team charts in the years that follow. If Witten’s correct, that path will probably look a lot like the one they’ve been on for a while.The story of Danny Ainge's Greece visit to watch Giannis Antetokounmpo is a wild one originally appeared on nbcsportsboston.comThe Boston Celtics took an early interest in Greece basketball star Giannis Antetokounmpo before he was selected in the 2013 NBA Draft.C's president of basketball operations Danny Ainge actually went over to Europe to watch Antetokounmpo play, and the postgame scene was nothing short of crazy.Fans were going wild, and some of them even yelled at Ainge because they thought he was associated with Antetokounmpo's team -- Ainge was sitting near its bench during the game.Check out the video below to hear the wild story of Ainge's scouting visit to Greece:Time for another \"Finding Giannis\" outtake. The first NBA team to scout Giannis was the Boston Celtics. As is often the case in Greece, hilarity ensued, as told by @GrgpanouOCT about Danny Ainge's visit. #FindingGiannis will be broadcasted Saturday on TNT at 630pm EST. pic.twitter.com/8bLjIjHv77— Jonathan Givony (@DraftExpress) February 14, 2019The Celtics liked what they saw from Antetokounmpo, but they decided to take Gonzaga forward/center Kelly Olynyk with their 2013 first-round pick instead. The C's made a trade with the Dallas Mavericks (who owned the No. 13 pick) to select Olynyk, whose ability to handle the ball and shoot well from the outside as a big man was appealing.Antetokounmpo ultimately was taken by the Milwaukee Bucks with the 15th pick. The \"Greek Freak\" has since become one of the league's best players and arguably is the leading candidate for MVP this season. It's still hard to fault Ainge and other executives for passing on Antetokounmpo, though. He was a very raw talent, and other players in that draft class were expected to provide more immediate contributions.Click here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports! Receive comprehensive coverage of your teams and stream the Celtics easily on your device.A weekly dive into the NBA’s hottest topics.We get it. You think the Rockets are boring. They run the same plays over and over again. All they do is flop and shoot free throws. Maybe they’re even ruining basketball. Who isn’t these days, right?Houston’s offense operates with rigid discipline. The Rockets run and run James Harden off screens until he finds a tenable matchup to exploit. Tenable, so we’re clear, is a loosely defined term for a player who only needs a sliver of space to shoot from anywhere on the floor, whose combined ball-handling and strength psychs out defenders and referees alike.It is repetitive, sure, but in a way that’s endlessly fascinating. The Rockets repeatedly put the ball in the hands of the one of the NBA’s most creative, destructive scorers and wait for him to find a sieve — or create one. Harden now holds the second-longest 30-point scoring streak in NBA history, breaking 31 games in Wednesday night’s loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves, and he’s averaging a league-scorching 36.5 points per game.I’d argue all that makes the Rockets more watchable than most teams, which dilly-dally for possessions at a time, only looking to optimize in the face of urgency. You won’t find any freewheeling action from Iguodala-types in Houston. Even Austin Rivers has (mostly) held himself in check. Every time I turn on a Rockets game, Harden or Chris Paul has possession of the ball and is on the cusp of doing something. The game becomes a successive highlight reel that doesn’t allow you to turn the dial.The same quality that makes the Rockets so entertaining right now — and will likely garner Harden a second MVP — might be what hurts them in the playoffs again. The fuse is burning bright: Harden holds the ball an average of 9.6 seconds when he touches it, the highest mark in the NBA. His usage rate is 39 percent, smashing second place by 7 percent. What Harden’s doing might not be the best idea for the Rockets’ future outlook.But it’s definitely not boring. Even on defense, an opponent can make a name for himself with a signature moment against Harden — just ask Josh Okogie.As for as Harden’s high free-throw attempts bogging the game down, I won’t be convinced that a generation that cuts away to their iPhone screen 50 times per day is that bothered by an opportunity to look away from the action. When Harden’s playing, it’s the only chance you’re going to get.Because it seems like it, at least in the East. For the past few weeks, the dominant Warriors storyline has been about how Kevin Durant’s impending free agency could impact their title run. After a win against the Utah Jazz two nights ago, Durant said he feels the team is not playing well. These are the same Warriors, mind you, who are 16-3 since the New Year. Not only have they won all 11 games DeMarcus Cousins has played in — they’ve blown the tops off buildings, outscoring opponents by 9.7 points per 100 possessions. Until July 1, Warriors inevitability reigns.Why is it, then, that the Eastern Conference is littered with high-end teams that made big bets on winning this year? The Boston Celtics made their bed a while ago, with Kyrie Irving’s contract expiring when the season ends. The Toronto Raptors traded franchise cornerstone DeMar DeRozan for a chance to woo Kawhi Leonard for a season. Then they doubled down by trading for Marc Gasol. In sum, the 76ers exchanged Jerryd Bayless, Robert Covington, Dario Saric, Wilson Chandler, Mike Muscala, Landry Shamet, two first-round picks and two second-round picks for Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris, a pair of stars with deals that expire at the end of the year.(Side note: At least one of these three teams has to flame out in the second round. And then what does it do? For once, the playoff drama will be in the East, if not the title.)Could it be possible that the Warriors are so dominant that they’ve convinced the rest of the NBA to change the goalposts of ultimate success? Because as it stands right now, we’ve got a set of teams that went all in on trying to get to second place. It feels more like they’re auditioning for a post-Warriors future than trying to succeed in the current landscape. Even in a world where success is narrowly defined by wins and losses, perception is everything. And some things are inherent: If the rest of the NBA can’t compete against the Warriors, they still can’t help but compete against themselves.The aftermath of the most emboldened trade request in recent NBA history has been ugly. Anthony Davis is not a Laker — or a Knick or a Celtic or a Buck for that matter. And the New Orleans Pelicans don’t seem to have much use for him either. They’d rather sit him and pile up losses, focus on the lottery race and protect Davis’ health so they can trade him in the offseason. But the NBA issued a directive: The Pelicans would be fined $100,000 for every game he sat.So it is that after playing well enough to keep the Pelicans in it, Davis was benched in the fourth quarter two games in a row. Then, against the Orlando Magic, they got blown out by 30 points, which led to Davis — chef’s kiss — criticizing the team’s effort. So things aren’t good. What’s worse: It doesn’t seem like they’re going to get any better.Thanks to the NBA’s orders, this is the only reasonable compromise for both the Pelicans and Davis. He gets to pervert his livelihood — surely important to a man who has spent so many days involuntarily sidelined by injuries — while the Pelicans at least get to lose some of the time.Here’s what it comes down to: The NBA can’t make a decision that weighs the Pelicans real interests, because it can’t be so blithely rational about what’s best for them, which is tanking. In an alternate universe with no draft lottery, the Pelicans might at least be incentivized to let Davis play when it matters to get fans in seats. But the league won’t acknowledge its worst kept secret, so a dysfunctional situation is primed to only get worse.Nothing like the 76ers to get the Boston Celtics going. And nothing like a loss to the Celtics on Tuesday night to spread anxiety in the lives of 76ers fans.Despite the addition of Tobias Harris, the 76ers lost to the Kyrie-less Celtics in the same ways they’ve habitually lost to them: The Celtics stuck like glue to the few shooters the 76ers play at the same time and treated Ben Simmons like a non-entity, while Al Horford ate Joel Embiid’s lunch. The Sixers couldn’t protect the perimeter on the other end, so they never got much of a chance to get out in transition.I won’t write them off as quickly as I did after Christmas, if only because Harris is the type of sharpshooter who could tip the scales in favor of an old-school style — if they’re willing to embrace it.Since trading for Jimmy Butler in November, the Sixers are seventh in pace, 11th in defense and 16th in offensive rebounding. This is a team with three starters who are above 6-foot-8, including the league’s most imposing center since Shaq, but it’s stuck in the middle because it’s trying to fit old-school parts into a new-school game. The league has been crashing full-tilt into more space and pace for years, so you can forgive the Sixers for trying, but you don’t win championships by playing against your strengths.Philadelphia should be slow, plodding, muscly and mean. It should crash the glass with impunity, hunt cross-matches with pick-and-rolls and bully defenders in the post. The mere idea of entering the paint against the 76ers should make opponents cower with fear.The only rub is that slowing it down doesn’t serve Ben Simmons’ style, but they’re going to have to figure out the inevitable tension between his transition-happy game and Embiid’s half-court dominance eventually. Better to do it while playing to your strengths and find out if it works now, instead of two years down the road.Following Jeremy Lin’s first game as a Raptor, he took to the podium and shared some interesting thoughts on the presence of the international media. Here are some snippets, from the Toronto Star:“Yeah, [Mandarin media] probably happens in every city that has a strong Asian contingent,” Lin said. “Happened in Atlanta as well, but not this. So again, I’m very proud to represent Asian people on a global platform, on a global scale. And for me to be here where there’s a lot of Asians, like, I used to run from it, you know?“Because that’s all anybody’s ever wanted to look for. Like, ‘Oh, he’s Asian, he’s Asian, he’s Asian.’ And I was like, talk about my basketball. But now people can see I can play, I belong in the NBA, and I’ve really embraced just being able to represent Asians and do it the right way, hopefully.“Yeah, I mean, I think I was really jaded after the New York stretch,” Lin continued. “I think there was a lot of things that happened that made me give up a little bit on people, per se. And that was a huge part of the story, and that was a huge point of contention for a lot of people as to why I was getting the publicity, or why things were the way they were.“So I kind of wanted to run from that a little bit. I would probably say three years down the road, I kind of turned a corner, and I would say being hurt for two straight years, and seeing that my Asian fan base, I don’t feel like it dropped off one bit. And I haven’t even touched the court. Like, every year I go over to Asia and I can’t even walk through the airport — it’s insane. So to see them do that after all the highs and lows, but really going through the lows post-Linsanity, which culminated in those injuries, for me, I’m still blown away. And again, that’s fed into why I want to carry myself a certain way.”I don’t have a lot to say here, except that it’s touching to see a man whose identity was leveraged and controlled by outside forces for so long get to stop running away from how he’s perceived and finally be himself: an NBA player who once turned the basketball universe on its head, an Asian-American, a God-fearing Harvard grad. He has lived long enough in the public eye that the public has finally accepted what they originally thought were contradictory traits. That, friends, is how stereotypes are broken.More from Yahoo Sports:• PGA Tour pro defends paying caddie $5K on $1.3M win • NFL bars NCAA’s all-time sack leader from combine • Only one NBA team failed to scout Antetokounmpo • Black History honor for Kaepernick sacked by lawmakers \n"

In any case, you have to admit the NBA never fails to entertain.More from Yahoo Sports: • Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight When spring training camps opened this week around Major League Baseball, it brought hope that maybe, finally, Bryce Harper and Manny Machado would sign with teams and baseball’s long free-agent freeze would melt away.Nope. Not yet. Not only has that not happened, something else did happen: a number of talented young players around the league have agreed to team-friendly contract extensions.The latest was New York Yankees ace Luis Severino, who on Friday reportedly agreed to a four-year, $40 million deal. The deal, first reported by Joel Sherman of the New York Post, would buy up Severino’s arbitration years and comes with a $15 million club option for his first year of free agency.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]By agreeing to this deal, the Yankees and Severino avoid arbitration for 2019. He’ll make $4 million this season, $10 million next, then $10.25 million in 2021 and $11 million in 2022. The club option is for 2023. In the grand scheme of society, this is a very generous contract. In baseball’s economic bubble, it’s another young player signing for below-market value relative to his skills and potential.It’s hard to blame Severino for taking the deal, looking around at a free-agent world where Harper and Machado are still available, as are Dallas Keuchel and Craig Kimbrel. Especially since we haven’t heard even slight grumblings about teams being interested in Keuchel and Kimbrel.Coming off a breakout season in which he went 19-8 with a 3.39 ERA, the 25-year-old Severino was given a deal that’s pretty hard to turn down: “Do you want $40 million guaranteed, yes or no?”The other players faced with a similar question this week were Philadelphia Phillies ace Aaron Nola, who said yes to a four-year, $45 million deal Wednesday. It also avoided arbitration and bought out two of Nola’s free agency years, making it the most below-market deal of any of these.The Minnesota Twins locked up two of their talented young players Thursday, as right fielder Max Kepler agreed to a five-year, $35 million deal with a $10 million club option for 2024. It buys out three years of free agency for Kepler, 26. Shortstop Jorge Polanco also agreed to a five-year extension, his is worth $25.75 million with two option years that could keep him in Minnesota through 2025.In a vacuum, these types of extensions look like win-wins: The players get guaranteed money as they’re coming off good seasons. The clubs get cost-certainty to help them navigate the future — whether it’s the Yankees and Phillies trying to add big free agents this year or next, or a team like the Twins striving for contention with a homegrown core.In a bigger sense, though, it’s hard not to look at these deals in the current state of free agency and wonder if they’re a symptom of something else. Is it the market correcting itself? Is it baseball’s economy morphing into something new? Or maybe it’s just players looking around and saying, “Well, I better get my money now.”According to numerous reports, there’s a fear that for this generation of young players the light at the end of the tunnel — the big free-agency payday — won’t be there for them in the same way it was for so many other players.So while it’s great that stars like Justin Verlander, Clayton Kershaw and Max Scherzer are publicly speaking out about the current state of free agency, they’re on the right side of it. They got their mega deals.The younger players find themselves in a different sort of peril. It’s entirely possible that these are the biggest paydays these players ever get, which is a much different economic model that we’ve seen from baseball in the past.Whether it’s right or wrong — and that’s certainly something that’s up for debate heading into the next collective-bargaining agreement — baseball’s economy has often been backward. Players get paid less, relative to the market, in their pre-free agency years. The best recent example is Mike Trout winning the MVP in 2014 at age 22 while making $1 million.He got a raise to $6 million the next season, but in 2015 was still making a fraction of what people like Ryan Howard ($25M), Albert Pujols ($24M), Joe Mauer ($23M), Mark Teixeira ($22.5M) and Jose Reyes ($22M) were making.But that overpay is a necessary part baseball’s economic ecosystem too. It’s a fact: Players get overpaid as their careers decline. It’s almost like baseball’s way of making up for underpaying players during their early years. It’s baseball’s golden parachute. What’s happening these days is fewer teams are accepting that overpay as part of the how the system works.In the past few years, arbitration salaries have gotten higher and higher, and teams have tried harder to lock up younger stars before free agency. It’s why we’ve see players like Madison Bumgarner, Chris Archer, Chris Sale and Paul Goldschmidt become valuable trade chips for their team-friendly contract extensions.Teams are getting smarter about where their money goes, and how to keep value in their assets. These extensions to Severino, Nola and the rest show that they’re willing to spend money, just in the way that they want.Earlier this week, former Miami Marlins president David Samson tweeted something in response to Justin Verlander, saying the “broken system” talk was wrong. Players and their agents, Samson said, needed to adjust to a “new reality.”He may be right about the new reality part. The monster paydays at the end of the free agency tunnel could be fading away. If Bryce Harper and Manny Machado can’t get them, who can?The new reality could be players seizing their money. Whenever they can.– – – – – –Mike Oz is a writer at Yahoo Sports.

However, Wainwright framed the situation with a little more urgency on Friday by expressing concerns that a day of reckoning could happen sooner than later.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]Speaking to InsideSTL.com’s Tim McKernan, Wainwright said it was inevitable that the players will go on strike unless major changes are made to help bridge the widening gap. But he’s also worried that frustrations could reach a boiling point during the season leading to some form of a revolt. Perhaps even a mid-season walkout.#STLCards pitcher Adam Wainwright on @TMASTL: “Unless something changes, there’s going to be a strike. 100%. I’m just worried people are going to walk-out mid-season.” pic.twitter.com/M8WeRVcASe— Tim McKernan (@tmckernan) February 15, 2019“Unless something changes, there’s going to be a strike. 100%,” Wainwright said regarding the free-agent freeze that has left stars like Bryce Harper and Manny Machado without contracts. “I’m just worried people are going to walkout midseason.”It’s conceivable given the current climate, but a players revolt on that level still feels like a long shot. The target date we should all still be looking at is Dec. 1, 2021. That’s when the current collective bargaining agreement ends and the owners will be forced to come to the table.That doesn’t mean we should just dismiss Wainwright’s concerns about a 2019 strike. While they might feel a little on the dramatic side, the frustration that has built all offseason as dozens of free agents, including and especially Harper and Machado, remain unsigned is becoming more palpable by the day. There’s a genuine feeling that owners are determined to cut back on salaries even as profits continue to reach new heights, it’s possible the players’ patience will run out if the free-agent freeze continues to drag on. Wainwright thinks so, and he’s far from alone.In Friday’s interview, the 37-year-old right-hander also criticized owners and front offense personnel for placing too much emphasis on “analytics” and placing everything in a “sabermetric box” that discounts intangibles and other immeasurable aspects of baseball.Adam Wainwright said today on ⁦@TMASTL⁩ that he expects there to be a strike “100%.”The context of the conversation comes from a discussion on how Bryce Harper and Manny Machado are still without teams.You can see Wainwright’s reasoning in the video below. pic.twitter.com/GXsmx4cXk1— Tim McKernan (@tmckernan) February 15, 2019Wainwright admitted that there’s always risk in making long-term financial commitments to players, but emphasized that doing so marks a commitment to winning that several teams seemingly lack.“Part of it is smart from their side of it, but you have to realize it’s about winning. So, if Bryce Harper wants 10 years and he’s 26 years old. He’s going to be a dynamic player. The same can be said about Manny Machado. These guys are superstar players.”The deeper we get into it the more obvious it is that the players know what battles lie ahead. The only real question is how much worse it will get before any progress is made toward a satisfactory resolution.More from Yahoo Sports:• Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight MLB rumors: Bryce Harper has made his decision, says D.C. radio host originally appeared on nbcsportsbayarea.comA report has come out from the East Coast saying Bryce Harper has come to a decision on which team he will play for in 2019 and beyond.Chris Russell, a sports radio talk show host from 106.7 The Fan in Washington D.C., (who has been on the Harper beat for some time) said the free agent slugger could make a decision in the next 24 hours.\"Maybe I took a little bit of a leap of faith here based on some indications I got from a real good source,\" Russell told 94WIP, in Philadelphia, on Friday.\"Bryce and his representatives, (Scott) Boras, his people, his wife Kayla, they've been meeting since Monday morning in Vegas. Bryce originally wanted this done, when it took this long, by Valentine's Day. Obviously, the contract has not been announced, signed, or whatever.\"\"But I'm led to believe by the people that I've talked to that are close to the situation -- and I have, again, a real good source that has helped me through this process, let's just leave it at that,\" Russell said. \"That Bryce was in a mood to celebrate yesterday. Now, the source said, 'I believe it's done.' I don't have concrete, 100 percent proof for you guys. I wish I did, otherwise, I would have it and I would be running around with it. But I don't have that, so I want to caution everybody in Philadelphia. But that's what I was led to believe, that this thing is now decided.\"Russell then mentioned the Phillies.\"Now, what comes then is hammering out a contract. And if we were to believe the report that the Philadelphia Phillies had not even extended a formal offer -- and I assume that to be a termed, written agreement, that type of thing, which I find hard to believe -- then there might be more legwork to this. And therefore, hey the decision may be done, but the contract still needs to be ironed out.\"[RELATED: Phillies fan participates in \"lent\" in hopes of recruiting Harper]Russell is being safe with the terminology he's using, which is understandable. And while we haven't been able to confirm these rumors, Harper, along with many other free agents, remains unsigned.The Giants appeared to be the \"mystery team\" that introduced themselves late into the Harper sweepstakes -- and when the radio hosts asked Russell his opinion on where the outfielder will end up next season, he believed Harper will be in an orange and black uniform.\"I don't think it's going to be the Nationals,\" Russell said. \"I think it's going to be the San Francisco Giants, but that is not by any means an 'I know that for a fact,' so I want to caution everybody -- I know how this works -- I get in trouble with everything I say on my radio show, and everyone blows it up.\" The wait continues ... Golden State Warriors stars Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant empathised with Steve Kerr after the head coach was ejected during the loss to the Portland Trail Blazers having thrown a clipboard in response to a flagrant foul call.Kerr was enraged late in the fourth quarter when Draymond Green was called for a flagrant foul after he stopped Zach Collins from approaching the rim as he went up for a shot.That drew Kerr's ire and after ranting in one referee's face, he slammed a clipboard down to earn an ejection, with Durant having to escort his head coach back off the court.The Warriors lost the game 129-107 but will still head into the All-Star break with the best record in the Western Conference.\"It was an emotional game. We fought really hard for 43 minutes,\" Curry told reporters afterwards.\"One questionable decision - the flagrant - obviously the fire came out. You see coach go and throw a clipboard. At that point you try to get us over the hump. An eight-point swing, it's tough to overcome.\"\"I looked at the replay and the amount of ball [Green] got, there was nothing excessive about it, he got all the ball.\"There was a lot of chirping, with Zach involved. There was probably a sensitivity to it, trying to put out some fires, but I thought it was a terrible call. We obviously paid the price for it with how everything unfolded after that.\"Durant shared that sympathy having been the one to pull Kerr away from the referees as he continued to rant at them.\"I felt for him, I understand his anger and his rage, especially for that call,\" he said.\"I thought we should have just kept playing, It was a common foul, I thought. Refs looked at it differently. \"I understand why coach was a little frustrated.\"Kerr explained that it was the disbelief at the call that had triggered his reaction.\"I was just shocked that that was called a flagrant foul,\" he said. \"I'm not sure how it's determined - if it's in New York or the officials on the call - but that was head-scratching: that that could be called a flagrant foul.\"The guy's going to go in for a dunk, you've got to make sure he doesn't dunk it.\"So, I told Kenny [Mauer] that I beg to differ. There might have been a couple of other words in there too!\"I'll have to ask the owner if the clipboard broke when I threw it down. I got a little anger out so that was good. I was too busy yelling to ask for an explanation.\"Charles Barkley thinks New Orleans Pelicans star Anthony Davis made a mistake with his trade request.The 25-year-old asked the Pelicans to move him in late January and the Los Angeles Lakers had been engaged in discussions about acquiring him. But, no deal was reached before the deadline and Davis remained with New Orleans.Barkley, an 11-time All-Star who works as an analyst for TNT, said he thinks Davis and his agent, Rich Paul, mishandled the situation.\"Don't ruin your reputation as a great player, one of the nicest guys in the world,\" Barkley told reporters on Thursday ahead of All-Star weekend (via the Washington Post).\"Remember, your agent works for you, you don't work for him. They handled that situation wrong. It's going to come back to bite them in the a***. It's unfortunate.\"The six-time All-Star entered play on Thursday averaging 28.5 points and 13.1 rebounds this season. But, he scored just three points in 24 minutes on the floor in the Pelicans' 118-88 loss to the Orlando Magic earlier this week.\"This is a bad situation,\" Barkley said. \"It's a bad look for the NBA. Because that kid can't go out there and give 100 per cent because he’s worried about getting hurt. The guy's the second-best player in the world and he's got three points? That's not a good look for the NBA.\"The Boston Celtics and New York Knicks, among others, are expected to explore dealing for Davis after the season. Barkley, however, said he believes the forward will eventually land in Los Angeles because of Paul's relationship with Lakers star LeBron James.Barkley tallied 22.1 points and 11.7 rebounds per game over his 16-year career. He retired in 2000 and was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame six years later.After an apology from Sergio Garcia, a non-apology from Matt Kuchar, and an uncooperative Mother Nature on Valentine's Day, it's time for everyone to focus again on Tiger Woods. Kidding. Sort of. A weather-delayed first round at Riviera re-starts on Friday morning and the 14-time major champ will be in the Hollywood-area spotlight as he finally begins his Genesis Open. And golf fans could potentially see a LOT of the tournament host as the event tries to play catch up after heavy rains on Thursday.Woods, Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas (Decent group, eh?) are scheduled to tee off at 8:32 local time (11:32 ET). The hope is they will complete their first rounds and then play as much of their second rounds as possible before darkness. And Tiger's hope is to finally win for the first time at this historic layout where he missed the cut last year. We'll be tracking Tiger every step of the way so keep it right here for the latest scores, news and highlights. (All times eastern)SATURDAY, 11:25: With a 25-foot birdie putt on No. 9, Woods' final hole of the second round, Tiger will likely make the cut. The birdie brought Woods back to even on his round and to one under overall.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096808527694245890After resuming play in the morning, Woods bogeyed his first hole, No. 4, then made four pars before his finishing birdie. His playing partners, however, fared much better. Justin Thomas shares the lead with Adam Scott at 11 under and Rory McIlroy birdied four of his six holes on Saturday morning to shoot 63 and move to seven under through 36 holes. Thursday's early wave is now on the course for their second rounds.-------------------FRIDAY-------------------8:25: And with that, the horn has sounded—play will be suspended for darkness on Friday at Riviera. Tiger, JT and Rory have six more holes to complete their second round. Justin Thomas is at 10-under, tied with Adam Scott for the lead. Tiger will hope Saturday brings some different momentum for him—as this marathon day ends with two bogeys in a row after the highlight eagle.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10965708926692065298:21: That's back-to-back bogeys now for Tiger Woods, dropping another shot here at the third hole (his 12th of the round). And over his past six holes, Tiger has four bogeys. The birdie at No. 1 helped negate most of that damage ... but Tiger's back to 1-under again—right on the current cut line.8:13: On his 30th hole of the day, Tiger is showing some obvious signs of being tired. And who could blame him—he's been playing golf for nearly 10 hours straight. From 165 yards out at the third hole, Tiger Woods tries to chop out a 6-iron and comes out of it. His ball comes to rest short of the green. With sunset in Pacific Palisades being 5:30 local time, this group will have time for maybe one more hole today.8:04: Tiger follows up that eagle putt at No. 1 with a bogey at the second hole. The third bogey of his second round moves Tiger back to 2-under overall.7:56: After a long wait at the second hole, Tiger sprays his second shot from 235 out with a fairway wood out to the right. He'll have his work cut out from the front right bunker to save par at the 482-yard par 4.7:40: This is exactly what Tiger Woods needed: He rolls in his 43-foot eagle putt at his 10th hole (the first) to get back to 3-under—negating those two bogeys he made on his front nine. What a putt! With the flagstick in!https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096570892669206529Tiger made a disappointing par to open his first round earlier today at the first hole. The unlikely eagle makes up for that effort—and could turn around Tiger's second round in a dramatic way. Tiger goes from toeing the cut line at 1-under to now all of a sudden being T-21.7:28: Tiger finds the fairway at the par-5 first hole, the group's 10th hole of their second round, as he attempts to get a shot back here after bogeying two of his final three holes on his front nine. Neither bogey was particularly bad—the 18th hole is playing brutally tough right now uphill and into the wind with the rain, making it even more of a challenging hole. And his break at 16 was very unlucky.7:16: Tiger and JT are gonna have their work cut out to save par at the 18th hole (their ninth). Each player had fairway wood approaches and tried playing a big cut. JT was way up left on the hill—Tiger was closer. He went high with his approach and will have about 11 feet left for par.Tiger misses the par putt, so he'll drop a shot along with JT as they make the turn. Tiger moves back to 1-under after 27 holes. That's where the cut line currently is—so all of a sudden, Tiger must be concerned about making the cut.7:01: Following Justin Thomas throwing a dart at the 17th to about 3 feet, Tiger puts his wedge shot from under 100 yards to outside 20 feet, so he'll be disappointed with that effort. The birdie putt misses on the high side, and Tiger taps in for par to remain at 2-under. His playing partner and buddy Justin Thomas stays hot, rolling in a fourth straight birdie to get to 9-under—tied for the lead with Adam Scott. Really impressive golf here from JT.6:54: The rain is really coming down now as the players head to the 17th hole. Tiger finds the fairway at the par-5 17th hole, but it was a short one—he has 326 yards left. Most players have been laying up at this par 5 all day.6:43: From a brutal position up against the back lip of the bunker, Tiger hacks it out—and somehow keeps the ball on the green, albeit the back portion. His par attempt from 44 feet away here comes up three feet shy. Tiger makes his bogey to move back to 2-under.Meanwhile, Justin Thomas is officially on fire. He has another birdie after a fabulous tee shot at 16. It's now two Kentucky boys tied at the top: Justin Thomas and J.B. Holmes (-8).https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10965576791939317766:39: Tiger will have serious lie issues at the par-3 16th hole. His tee shot came to rest up against the back lip of the bunker. As Billy Kratzert just remarked on PGA Tour Live, Tiger will do well just to keep this ball on the green. Though he avoided dropping a shot on his last hole, there might be a bogey in his future here.6:35: A clutchhh par save by Tiger at the 15th hole makes up for his poor chip—and Tiger keeps the momentum going on his second round, as he stays 3-under for the tournament and 2-under on the round.Justin Thomas, also in Tiger's group, holed out from in front of the green for birdie at the 14th hole, and he makes a long birdie putt at 15 to get to 7-under—just one back of fellow Kentucky native J.B. Holmes.6:32: A poor chip shot from Tiger at the 15th hole leaves him about 13 feet away. He'll need to convert that putt to prevent dropping his first shot of his second round.6:24: Tiger finds another fairway here at Riviera, this one at the 15th hole. The guy is feeeling it with his driver. Almost on auto pilot. His approach from 190 out turns a little too much, finding the rough to the left of the green. He'll have to get up and down to avoid dropping one here.6:20: From 20 feet out, Tiger's birdie bid comes up shy—never really scaring the hole, despite getting a good look at the line from Rory's putt. Tiger taps in for par to remain at 3-under.The putter has been disappointing for Tiger all day: He had 34 putts in his first round, including four three-putts, just the third time in his career he's done that.6:13: Tiger puts his tee shot at the par-3 14th hole just inside Rory's ball—about 20 feet right of the hole. He'll get a little teach from Rory's putt, too, as Tiger continues to hit it well today.6:07: Tiger just misses the left-to-right curling bid for birdie, leaving himself with an easy par at 13. He stays 3-under for the tournament and -2 through four on his round.Tiger's playing partners are also playing well—Rory has three birdies in his first four holes to get to 2-under. Look out for Rory at rainy Riviera. And Justin Thomas, despite hitting his tee shot out of bounds at 13, got up and down from 160 yards to avoid dropping multiple shots. He's now 5-under after that bogey.6:02: Another grooved tee shot for Tiger Woods at the 13th hole puts him in good position. He turned over his tee shot—putting his draw in the middle of the fairway at the dogleg left. Tiger spins his approach back to about 15 feet, just off the green in the fringe. He'll have a chance to knock another one here and keep the momentum going.5:51: Bang! Tiger nails the 25-footer for birdie at the 12th hole to add a second birdie to his card through three holes. Realistically, too, it could be three straight birdies for Tiger. But the 14-time major champion is now 2-under through 3—T-3 for the tournament (T-19)—and carries some strong momentum on his side at the start of his second round ... as the rain is coming down at Riviera.5:46: Tiger hits his approach hole high—about 25 feet from 181 yards. He'll have another chance to add a birdie to his third round.Tiger's currently at 2-under, which puts him at T-29. The projected cut is at 1-under—so he's comfortably inside the number as of now. But there's a ton of golf to be played, obviously.5:41: Tiger finds the fairway with his driver at the par-4 12th hole. The 12th usually plays as one of the toughest holes at Riviera—we'll see if Tiger can take advantage of his position here in the fairway.5:33: An excellent fairway-wood second shot by Tiger put him right in front of the par-5 11th green in two. But a very poor approach putt for his third leaves him more than 10 feet away. His birdie try slides by for a very disappointing par being so close in 2. That should've been a golden opportunity to start his second round with two birdies—instead, Tiger stays at 2-under.5:12: Tiger goes high with his pitch—having to navigate around the front bunker, and plays it nicely—spinning it about 7 feet short of the hole. So Tiger will have a good look for an opening birdie to start his second round. Tiger converts the birdie putt to move to 2-under.5:02: Only a little more than a half hour after finishing his first round, Tiger Woods (-1) -- along with Justin Thomas (-5) and Rory McIlroy (+1) -- has teed off in his second round. The group started on the drivable 10th hole, and Tiger has driven his tee shot just off the green. He'll have a chance to put his pitch shot close to start his second round with a birdie.4:24: Tiger narrowly misses the birdie putt at the 18th hole, so he'll tap in for a par and an opening-round, one-under 70 at Riviera. Having three-putted for a fourth time on the 17th hole to drop a shot in disappointing fashion, Tiger will head to his second round a bit frustrated. But the four consecutive birdies showed him being able to score well at Riviera, where he has never won.Tiger, JT (who birdied 18 to finish at 5-under) and Rory will head right back for their second round in this marathon day for them.4:18: Tiger responds to that shocking three-putt with a perfect drive and a towering 6-iron on Riviera's famed 18th. Woods is in good shape to at least make par the difficult hole, but as we've seen all day, a two-putt is anything but automatic.Here's an unusual stat on Tiger three-putting four times this afternoon. He's making some history in a bad way...https://twitter.com/JustinRayGolf/status/10965196250582507574:06: So much for the momentum. . . After a decent approach shot that spins back to about 20 feet, Woods runs his birdie putt a couple feet by and. . . gulp. . . misses the comebacker from about two feet. Wow. That's four three-putts on the day as Tiger falls back to one under with one hole to play.3:57: Uh-oh, it's raining in southern California again. Meanwhile, Woods is plodding his way up the par-5 17th. After pulling his drive into the left rough and drawing a poor lie, Woods pushed his layup slightly into the first cut of the right rough. He'll have a some sort of wedge to a back-right hole location.3:50: Tiger's tee shot was tracking on the par-3 16th, but it comes up about 30 feet short. From there, he two-putts for par to remain at two under. Justin Thomas makes his 10-foot birdie effort to move to four under, while Rory McIlroy remains at one over. McIlroy hast two holes to avert his first over-par score of 2019.3:40: After another great drive and a solid approach, Woods races his birdie attempt nearly five feet past the hole. But he keeps the overall positive momentum going by converting the par putt to remain at two under. Tiger has three more holes to play. At least, before he gets a lunch break.3:24: BANG! There's the bounce back from Tiger. It just came one hole later. And from farther away as Woods drains his 12-footer for birdie on No. 14.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096507996031467520Woods is now back to two under, five shots behind Jordan Spieth, who has to be pleased to still be in front by two despite these soft conditions.3:17: Tiger hits a great shot on the difficult par-3 14th hole to about 15 feet. He'll have a good look at birdie coming up. In the meantime, here's a look at how the leader board stands with Jordan Spieth still leading the way.Jordan Spieth (-7) 2t. Tony Finau (-5) 2t. Patrick Rodgers (-5) 2t. Kramer Hickok (-5) 2t. Davis Love III (-5) 2t. Adam Scott (-5) 2t. J.B. Homes (-5)Click here for full scores.3:13: Woods stuck his approach to about four feet below the hole on No. 13. A bounce back birdie looked like a forgone conclusion until he pushed his effort. Woof. That's two three-putts and two short misses on the greens for Tiger today. He remains at one under. Meanwhile, Rory McIlroy, after getting to two under through eight, has fallen to one over after back-to-back bogeys. Justin Thomas, the third player in the group, continues to lead this trio at three under.3:05: After hitting fade after fade, Woods steps to the 13th tee and rips a draw around the corner, perfectly setting up his next shot. Good to see him working it both ways with ease.3:01: Tiger pushed his tee shot into the right rough, then hit a fantastic recovery shot from a thick lie onto the green. He had a long look at birdie that rolled about four feet past, leaving him with a tricky left-to-right par putt, which he missed. That's three three putts on the day for Woods, and he's still one under.2:39: Not the best chip from Woods, as he left himself about six feet for birdie, but he makes it anyway. Four straight for Tiger to get to two under for the day.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10964952191957975042:30: Woods rips a 3-wood from 269 to just in front of the green. Hate to jinx him, but there's no reason he shouldn't easily make his fourth straight birdie here (ducks).2:20: Three in a row for Woods as he rolls in another at No. 10 and moves to one under. If he finds the fairway again at the 11th, four in a row will be in his sights. Meanwhile, Rory makes his par to stay at one under and JT ends up holing his 10 footer for birdie to get to four under. Finally a little bit of JUICE from this threesome.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096489287753711616https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096489787672780800By the way, it looks like we know when they'll be heading back out for round two later today. Here's an update from the Tiger Tracker:https://twitter.com/GCTigerTracker/status/1096481806067523585That should give them enough time to get at least 11 or 12 holes in.At the 11th, Woods stripes another drive down the fairway. He's really starting to cook.2:12: Tiger's shot was a tad more difficult than we thought, as he had to avoid a bunker and take it up high to get it back to the pin. He was successful, sticking it to about three feet. Hell of a shot. Even better was Rory's shot, as he flopped it from a nice lie and got it to hang on just off the back of the green and stay out of the back bunker. Thomas, who had the easiest shot, put too much spin on his chip, leaving himself with about 10 feet for birdie.2:07: Finally, Tiger, Rory and JT hit their tee shots, and it looks like the ensuing entertainment will be well worth the wait. Tiger is in the collection area left of the green, where he has a straightforward chip that should set him up with a good chance to make birdie. Thomas is just in front of the green, and he'll have a great chance to make a birdie as well. Rory ... um ... not so much. He's in the rough with a greenside bunker in front of him and a pin he won't be able to get close to, and just holding the green would be a miracle.1:52: Woods drains his four-footer for bird and turns in even par 35. Real strong finish to his opening nine, and now it looks like he'll have a long wait at the 10th. DeChambeau, Kuchar and Rahm have still yet to hit their tee shots.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10964831254067896321:47: Tiger had just 122 left to the green and stuck one in there close. He has four feet left for birdie to turn in even par, which would be a small victory after that ugly three putt back at No. 7. Not to mention he'll have a prime opportunity to get into red figures at the driveable par-4 10th.1:41: Woods cranks another high fade right down the middle with the driver at No. 9. With the tees up today, he'll have a low iron in his hand for his approach.1:34: And he's on the board! Woods bounces back with a birdie putt from 15 feet, getting him back to one over. We'll see if that gets him going before making the turn.1:30: From 125 yards out, Woods hit a wedge and hated it from the second he made contact. While he did pull it, he's still hole high and inside 20 feet. Hideki Matsuyama-esque move from Tiger.1:24: Woods rips one right down the middle at the par-4 eighth. Should have a short iron in.1:15: Tiger's birdie putt was actually from just off the green on the fringe, and he rolled it by some four feet. Then, he missed the comebacker for par, dropping to two over on the day. Oof.1:09: Fairway and a green for Woods at the seventh. Good look at birdie coming up to get back to level par.12:58: Another hole, another par for Woods, who two-putted from 24 feet on the par-3 sixth. In the group up ahead, though, Jon Rahm is making a move at three under through six.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/109646557828021452912:47: Another meh hole for Tiger on No. 5, just missing the fairway with his tee shot, finding the front of the green with a so-so approach, and two-putting for another par from 43 feet. Woods remains at one over through five holes while his playing partners, McIlroy and Thomas, both remain at one under.12:42: As Matt Kuchar's ball is in the air on the par-3 sixth, a fan yells, \"Go low—just not with the gratuity!\" Despite Matt maintaining this is \"not a story,\" it is. And this won't be the last comment like this.12:29: Woods hit a nice shot to about 15 feet on the par-3 fourth, but ran his birdie effort by the hole. Still one over. Still no highlights. At least, from Tiger. Here was Spieth's closing birdie from about an hour ago, because there is not much else exciting going on right now.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/109644546143346688112:17: Another missed fairway and another short approach from Tiger on the par-4 third. Although, Woods found the putting surface, he was unable to two-putt from 63 feet, missing a seven-footer for par after badly misreading his first putt. That drops Tiger to one over through three holes. Not a lot of highlights so far. . .12:02: Tiger misses right off the tee on No. 2 then comes up short on another approach. But his pitch shot nearly goes down, leaving him with a tap-in par. Even par through two holes.11:49: After that perfect opening tee shot, Tiger hit a hideous approach with a 5-iron that came up way short in a fairway bunker. From there, he hit his third to 10 feet but missed the putt to walk away with a disappointing par. Both of Tiger's playing partners, McIlroy and Thomas, make birdie.11:38: Matt Kuchar just misses his eagle attempt from 25 feet on No. 1, but taps in for birdie. Kuchar has been in the news a lot this week over a caddie controversy dating back to his win at the Mayakoba Golf Classic. A controversy he didn't help with his comments on Wednesday. Is it possible some of those \"Kuuuuch\" shouts will turn to \"Mooooch\"? Kinda sounded like it on the first hole. . .11:34: Jordan Spieth is in with a seven-under-par 64 to take the early lead. Spieth needed only 21 putts during his bogey-free round. Of course, starting tournaments hasn't been a problem for Spieth of late. Finishing, however, has been a different story. Incredibly, Spieth is looking for his first win since the 2017 British Open and his first top 5 since last year's Masters.11:32: Woods smashes a driver off the first tee that finds the fairway. The opening par 5 at Riviera is essentially a long par 4 and one of the easiest holes on the PGA Tour all year so Tiger is thinking at least birdie after that tee shot.10:53: So far, so good on the Friday weather:https://twitter.com/GCTigerTracker/status/1096437235262533632And with lift, clean and place in play (for at least the first round), low scores are out there. Let's set the over/under on the Par-71 layout at 68.5.10:45: We are approximately 45 minutes away from Tiger's tee time and it's another major champ who is already off to a fantastic start. Jordan Spieth has the lead at six under through 15 holes. Spieth leads Patrick Rodgers by one and then there's a big group at four under, including Bill Haas, who is playing in the event a year after being involved in a car accident during last year's tournament that killed a friend he was staying with. Make sure you read Brian Wacker's piece from earlier in the week on how Haas is still trying to move on from that tragedy.10:35: As we move within an hour from Tiger teeing off, check out GOLFTV's latest behind-the-scenes video with Woods in which he says his bag has up to 16(!) golf gloves during rainy rounds and he explains why he doesn't like wearing rain jackets:https://twitter.com/GOLFTV/status/1096246456795697153\"Pops used to say, 'Once you're wet, you're wet.

Once he started running the front office, his blinking at Paul George on national TV contributed to the Lakers getting fined again for tampering.

But anybody else do it, they don’t get fined. So I’m going to stay away from that one.I don’t blame Johnson for feeling that way.Other teams’ owners, coaches and executives have repeatedly publicly discussed rival players without facing announced punishment.To be fair, the NBA doesn’t reveal every fine. Bucks owner Marc Lasry reportedly just got fined for tampering, but the league never announced it. But, at minimum, there’s an inconsistency with how the NBA exposes Johnson’s transgressions.Even NBA commissioner Adam Silver said last year there’s a spotlight on the Lakers due to prior tampering. That strikes me as unfair. The Lakers already paid for their prior violations and should now be held to the same standard as everyone else.And for what it’s worth, I wish that standard allowed an all-time great point guard like Johnson to publicly share his thoughts on Kemba Walker.Gareth Bale has landed himself in hot water after La Liga denounced the Real Madrid star for his celebration in the Madrid derby, which could carry a ban of four to 12 games.The Welsh forward scored as a substitute in the 3-1 victory over Atletico Madrid, bringing up his 100th goal for the club.And during the celebrations that followed, Bale \"lifted his right arm near his head in a clear sign of provocation towards the fans, then giving a gesture which could be seen as obscene and disdainful by folding his arm and striking it with his other hand.\"In a statement released by La Liga, Bale’s punishment will be decided by whether he incited the crowd or not.If Bale is guilty of “inciting opposition fans” to cause a hostile reaction, the punishment could carry four to 12 games, if there was no hostile reaction but intent, then it could be as little as one to three games.The gesture is referred to in Spain as ‘corte de mangas,’ with the moment not picked up in the referee’s match report.A committee will now decide whether the gesture merits a punishment.Bale also featured in Real’s Champions League victory over Ajax.Los Blancos take a 2-1 lead back to the Bernabeu for the second leg of the last 16 tie after Marco Asensio’s late winner.Earlier this week Heisman Trophy winner — and first round draft pick of the Oakland Athletics — Kyler Murray chose football over baseball, committing himself to the NFL draft. It was a move that, however sensible from Murray’s point of view, has led to a lot of soul-searching among baseball folks and has raised questions about what the sport offers young, talented athletes with other options.It’s not that bleak, however! Another outstanding college football player said no to football this week and reaffirmed his commitment to baseball. Tim Tebow! From PFT:One Florida Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback will not be coaching another in the Alliance of American Football.Steve Spurrier, the Florida Heisman winner who later coached the Gators to a national championship and is now head coach of the AAF’s Orlando Apollos, said this morning on PFT Live that after the AAF briefly reached out to Tebow in the ball, it became clear that Tebow’s focus is on playing baseball.Ok, so maybe Tebow is not turning down quite the football opportunity that Murray would’ve been. But take your victories where you can get them, baseball.Follow @craigcalcaterraPhil Mickelson is on an all-time heater in the early portion of the 2019 season. In the last month alone he's won his 44th PGA Tour event, finished second in another, hit every fairway in a round for the first time in 21 years, shot a 60, pulled off this impossible recovery shot, gone viral just by rolling his eyes and said he might drop the Players from his schedule because he's already won it (a literal mic drop). The man simply cannot be stopped right now.Leave it to the weather to literally rain on Lefty's parade. On Thursday at the Genesis Open, Mickelson began his first round at the difficult short par-4 10th and drove into one of the bunkers up near the green, leaving him with a dreaded lengthy sand shot. He wound up hitting it over the green, and his ball plugged in the back bunker, setting up an even harder shot than he just had. As you'll hear PGA Tour Live commentator Shane Bacon say, avoiding making a six was probably the goal, but after Mickelson hit his third into another bunker on the other side of the green, a six suddenly became best-case scenario. How does a four sound instead?https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096076528142626818Find us a more Phil Mickelson par ever... you can't. He's always got a flair for the dramatic. The problem? It's not going to count, as the tour wiped scores from the first 30 minutes of play due to the weather, thus making this the greatest par that never counted. It still counts in his mind though:https://twitter.com/PhilMickelson/status/1096106399958937605Peak Phil.RELATED: Where does Phil Mickelson rank among the greatest OMGs? (Old man golfers)The dust is barely settled in the wake of the end of the Markelle Fultz era in Philadelphia, and the former 76ers guard is already taking shots at his old team.His old coach Brett Brown in particular.Fultz had his introductory press conference with the Orlando Magic on Thursday after being traded at last week’s deadline and praised his new coach Steve Clifford while taking a veiled shot at Brown.“It just excites me to know that I have a coach that’s going to push you to be better and not just going to tell you what you want to hear,” Fultz said.That’s direct praise for his new coach. But the message for Brown is clear. Fultz didn’t like what he heard from the Philadelphia coaching staff.Fultz never had any public dispute with the 76ers, but it was evident that he and the team had different approaches to the struggles that saw him shoot 41.4 percent from the field, 26.7 percent from 3-point distance and 53.4 percent from the line in limited action after being selected as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2017 draft.It’s still not clear whether injury or a mental block – or both – are the cause of his shooting issues.After his agent announced that the nerve disorder thoracic outlet syndrome was the root of the shooting woes, Fultz never played again for the 76ers.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]Fultz appears to be fully embracing the fresh start in Orlando as a player and a person.“I think the biggest thing we talked about what doing thing the right way,” Fultz said. “Just building me up both as a man and on the court. I think that’s music to my ears, really just. Two things I really want to do is be the best player I can be and be the best young man I can be.”Fultz described the experience of his nerve disorder to reporters.“It’s hard to lift up your arms, you lose feeling in your fingers,” Fultz said. “You can’t tell when it’s going to happen. It’s not like you do the same motion every time. You get tingling in your fingers, numbness. Stuff like that.”He also curtly dismissed any notion that his shooting struggles are due to anything but injury.“I had an injury,” Fultz said. “I was out there trying to play through that. I never lost confidence.”Asked about a timetable to return, Fultz dodged the question to talk about rehab.“Right now it’s just about getting everything the right way,” he said. “Rehab’s been going great. I’m just taking my time and doing everything the right way.”More from Yahoo Sports: • PGA Tour pro defends paying caddie $5K on $1.3M win • NFL bars NCAA’s all-time sack leader from combine • Only one NBA team failed to scout Antetokounmpo • Black History honor for Kaepernick sacked by lawmakers He might not be well known to NFL fans at large, but New England Patriots fans know linebacker Kyle Van Noy — acquired basically for free from the Detroit Lions at the 2016 trade deadline — has been a big part of the defense the last two years, and has a knack for making plays at the right time.Van Noy is getting a little shine after winning his second Super Bowl ring with New England, appearing on the “Pardon My Take” podcast on Thursday to dish on all things Patriots and Super Bowl LIII.One thing that Van Noy revealed: the Los Angeles Rams didn’t do anything surprising during the game on offense.“I couldn’t believe that,” Van Noy said. “They really didn’t do — not one wrinkle. I was like, ‘What the hell?’ They’ve got so many good players, they’ve got so many things they’ve done all year, and the one play they gave us which was a wrinkle was the [Brandin] Cooks screen that hit for a little bit.“And that was it… Or maybe too, we were playing so good they were like, ‘[Expletive], we don’t know what to do.’ ”Hindsight, of course, is 20-20, but given that the Patriots’ coaching staff is known for having its players prepared for any and everything, it seems unwise that Los Angeles didn’t add some new plays or looks to try to stump New England.Van Noy said the Patriots’ culture, specifically coach Bill Belichick’s practice of not sparing anyone in the film room, even Tom Brady, is part of why the team continues to win.“Oh yeah. Yeah, that [stuff is] sick, to be honest, because it sets the table,” Van Noy said. “Like, OK, it doesn’t matter who you are, everyone’s on an even playing field. This is how it is here at work. You come in and you earn everything.“And I respect that because I felt like that gave me a chance to get on the field when I came in mid-year, and [Belichick] was like, ‘It doesn’t matter who you are or what you’ve done. You earn your keep.’ ”More from Yahoo Sports: • Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight The Brady Conundrum: How do you go about replacing the GOAT? originally appeared on nbcsportsboston.comThe Patriots hatched a Tom Brady succession plan after the 2013 season when they drafted Jimmy Garoppolo.Brady blew that up.Now, five years, four Super Bowl appearances, three Super Bowl wins, two Super Bowl MVPs and a regular-season MVP later, it's time to gingerly -- caaaauuuuuutiooooousssssllllyyyyy -- begin the process again.This time should be different.Even though Brady's contract hasn't been extended past the 2019 season, the love and happiness we saw on the field after the Rams were dispatched in SB53 is a good sign.MORE PATRIOTSAreas of Change: Will Pats be able to retain free agents Trey Flowers and Trent Brown?Brady's wariness about the Patriots' plans for him, and Bill Belichick's wariness about wedding his team to a quarterback who's closer to 50 years old than he is to 30, has dissipated.Once a new deal is in place -- Jonathan Kraft indicated that might be before training camp, though as of the Super Bowl conversations hadn't started -- Brady will have a written assurance that he will leave the Patriots and the NFL on his terms.That wasn't the case in early 2014 when the soon-to-be-37-year-old Brady saw the Patriots spend a first-round pick on a defensive tackle (Dominique Easley) and their second-rounder on Garoppolo. That, after a '13 season Brady spent throwing to the likes of Aaron Dobson, Josh Boyce, Kenbrell Thompkins and Austin Collie.Garoppolo was a stick of dynamite under Brady's behind. He was the existential threat Brady feared made flesh.Jimmy might have thought he was drafted to learn how to play quarterback in the NFL and have a nice career. To Brady, Garoppolo was there to take his job, throw his career into upheaval, uproot his family and see Brady cast out into the NFL wilderness.MORE PATRIOTSPerry: If Beckham is on the trade block, should Patriots be willing to pay the price?And, in contrast to the guy Brady succeeded in 2001 (and, by extension, did all those things to), Brady wasn't going to snort derisively at the plucky little draft pick here to take his job. He would crush the threat.He did.Brady played so well that -- despite Garoppolo developing into a bona-fide front-line quarterback under Belichick and Josh McDaniels (and Brady) -- Brady left the ever-prepared Patriots with no recourse when Garoppolo's contract was about to expire.Brady was too good to bench and too important to trade. Garoppolo was too expensive to franchise and too smart to take a \"bridge\" contract so he could watch Brady from the sidelines while his own hair started to gray at the temples. So off he went around Halloween, 2017.A lot's happened in the 16 months since.MORE PATRIOTSPhil Perry's Mock Draft 1.0: Pats start looking for Gronk's replacementBut now here we are, in the offseason of Brady's 42nd year. And the complex question of how to find the player who will eventually replace the greatest quarterback in NFL history still lingers.Do you draft his successor? If you do, do you do it this year? Do you do it next year?Do you try to get into the top 10 to get your pick of the litter? Do you stay put, confident that the muttonheads across the league will miss out as they did with Brady and Garoppolo (or Aaron Rodgers, Russell Wilson, Drew Brees, Brett Favre, Johnny Unitas . . . you get the point)? How much will it cost to get into the top 10? Do you package picks from this season -- when you will have six in the first three rounds -- and pick a sucker who will suck next year and fleece them for their 2020 first-rounder? How high do you have to go for a blue-chip, given the number of first-round quarterbacks that will be taken this year and that were taken in 2018?Is it a trade for somebody another team's given up on or has no work for, like San Francisco's Nick Mullens? A veteran who will hit free agency like Nick Foles, Case Keenum or Teddy Bridgewater?How does the successor play the position? Similar to Brady in that brain/eyes/accuracy/commitment trumps legs/arm strength/versatility?MORE PATRIOTSShould Pats be interested in Demaryius Thomas? No . . . and yesOr is there an embrace of the fact that trying to find a quarterback similar to a guy who came into the league after four years at Michigan at the end of last century with a once-in-a-lifetime work ethic is a pipe dream?Aside from who the successor is and how he plays, can Brady -- the lion in winter -- be tapped to help groom whoever is being brought aboard to take over?Brady -- contrary to sexed-up speculation -- didn't actively undermine Garoppolo at any point. They were teammates. He helped Garoppolo play the position better. They became close. But he wasn't quite showing him his world, either. Brady is famous for saying he's not giving away his secrets to younger quarterbacks until after he's done.With the end-date likely to be agreed upon when he signs an extension, does he become more a mentor so that the success of the franchise has a better chance to continue after he leaves? Would the Patriots want him to do that?Or would they want a blank(ish) slate to work with that isn't saying, \"But Tom said . . . \" when they try to shape him to succeed?And that contract? What's it look like? Does Brady demand pay commensurate with what he's accomplished? Is he in the mood to do the team another financial solid given the only bump they have him in 2018 was incentives he never reached? How does that impact the structure of the team?These questions aren't new. What is new is the level of angst and anxiousness. It's dissipated tremendously.That won't make finding his replacement or choosing the means by which the Patriots will do it any easier. But it's less fraught now.The irony is, the Patriots already successfully found Brady's successor. It's just that 2014 was too soon to go looking for him.Now, can they do it again?Click here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!

Before the team's loss to the Blazers on Wednesday night, he told ESPN that he \"wants to finish his career as a Warrior.\"      View this post on Instagram    Klay wants to stay in The Bay.A post shared by  espn (@espn) on Feb 13, 2019 at 9:23pm PSTThompson is set to be an unrestricted free agent at the end of the 2018-19 season.This isn't the first time Klay has made his feelings known. Even his father Mychal, who played five seasons for the Lakers, believes his son will re-sign with the Warriors. [RELATED: For Steve Kerr, Steph Curry and Klay Thompson are mix of NBA past and present]The Warriors selected Thompson with the No. 11 overall pick in the 2011 NBA Draft. Since then, he's been a five-time NBA All-Star, three-time Finals champion and two-time All-NBA selection. Anything could happen, but it's safe to say the Klay and the Dubs have quite the relationship and are ready to tie the knot.Jason Witten never worked with Kellen Moore as a coach, but he did practice with Moore when both of them were still active players with the Cowboys.That experience is enough for Witten to think Moore has “a way about him” that will pay off in his new job as the Cowboys offensive coordinator. Witten said this week that he believes Moore will be innovative and that the offense will take a “big step” by gearing things around quarterback Dak Prescott.“Yeah, I think he will do the things that Dak likes to do,” Witten said, via the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. “He will do the things they have to do to win. That is the way they have to play. I think they will use the pass to set up the run. Not just the run to set up the pass. I think he will add some nice wrinkles to that offense.”With head coach Jason Garrett coaching in the final year of his contract, Moore’s work with the offense will have a lot to do with how Dallas does in 2019 and with the path the team charts in the years that follow. If Witten’s correct, that path will probably look a lot like the one they’ve been on for a while.The story of Danny Ainge's Greece visit to watch Giannis Antetokounmpo is a wild one originally appeared on nbcsportsboston.comThe Boston Celtics took an early interest in Greece basketball star Giannis Antetokounmpo before he was selected in the 2013 NBA Draft.C's president of basketball operations Danny Ainge actually went over to Europe to watch Antetokounmpo play, and the postgame scene was nothing short of crazy.Fans were going wild, and some of them even yelled at Ainge because they thought he was associated with Antetokounmpo's team -- Ainge was sitting near its bench during the game.Check out the video below to hear the wild story of Ainge's scouting visit to Greece:Time for another \"Finding Giannis\" outtake. The first NBA team to scout Giannis was the Boston Celtics. As is often the case in Greece, hilarity ensued, as told by @GrgpanouOCT about Danny Ainge's visit. #FindingGiannis will be broadcasted Saturday on TNT at 630pm EST. pic.twitter.com/8bLjIjHv77— Jonathan Givony (@DraftExpress) February 14, 2019The Celtics liked what they saw from Antetokounmpo, but they decided to take Gonzaga forward/center Kelly Olynyk with their 2013 first-round pick instead. The C's made a trade with the Dallas Mavericks (who owned the No. 13 pick) to select Olynyk, whose ability to handle the ball and shoot well from the outside as a big man was appealing.Antetokounmpo ultimately was taken by the Milwaukee Bucks with the 15th pick. The \"Greek Freak\" has since become one of the league's best players and arguably is the leading candidate for MVP this season. It's still hard to fault Ainge and other executives for passing on Antetokounmpo, though. He was a very raw talent, and other players in that draft class were expected to provide more immediate contributions.Click here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!

They run the same plays over and over again. All they do is flop and shoot free throws. Maybe they’re even ruining basketball. Who isn’t these days, right?Houston’s offense operates with rigid discipline. The Rockets run and run James Harden off screens until he finds a tenable matchup to exploit. Tenable, so we’re clear, is a loosely defined term for a player who only needs a sliver of space to shoot from anywhere on the floor, whose combined ball-handling and strength psychs out defenders and referees alike.It is repetitive, sure, but in a way that’s endlessly fascinating. The Rockets repeatedly put the ball in the hands of the one of the NBA’s most creative, destructive scorers and wait for him to find a sieve — or create one. Harden now holds the second-longest 30-point scoring streak in NBA history, breaking 31 games in Wednesday night’s loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves, and he’s averaging a league-scorching 36.5 points per game.I’d argue all that makes the Rockets more watchable than most teams, which dilly-dally for possessions at a time, only looking to optimize in the face of urgency. You won’t find any freewheeling action from Iguodala-types in Houston. Even Austin Rivers has (mostly) held himself in check. Every time I turn on a Rockets game, Harden or Chris Paul has possession of the ball and is on the cusp of doing something. The game becomes a successive highlight reel that doesn’t allow you to turn the dial.The same quality that makes the Rockets so entertaining right now — and will likely garner Harden a second MVP — might be what hurts them in the playoffs again. The fuse is burning bright: Harden holds the ball an average of 9.6 seconds when he touches it, the highest mark in the NBA. His usage rate is 39 percent, smashing second place by 7 percent. What Harden’s doing might not be the best idea for the Rockets’ future outlook.But it’s definitely not boring. Even on defense, an opponent can make a name for himself with a signature moment against Harden — just ask Josh Okogie.As for as Harden’s high free-throw attempts bogging the game down, I won’t be convinced that a generation that cuts away to their iPhone screen 50 times per day is that bothered by an opportunity to look away from the action. When Harden’s playing, it’s the only chance you’re going to get.Because it seems like it, at least in the East. For the past few weeks, the dominant Warriors storyline has been about how Kevin Durant’s impending free agency could impact their title run. After a win against the Utah Jazz two nights ago, Durant said he feels the team is not playing well. These are the same Warriors, mind you, who are 16-3 since the New Year. Not only have they won all 11 games DeMarcus Cousins has played in — they’ve blown the tops off buildings, outscoring opponents by 9.7 points per 100 possessions. Until July 1, Warriors inevitability reigns.Why is it, then, that the Eastern Conference is littered with high-end teams that made big bets on winning this year? The Boston Celtics made their bed a while ago, with Kyrie Irving’s contract expiring when the season ends. The Toronto Raptors traded franchise cornerstone DeMar DeRozan for a chance to woo Kawhi Leonard for a season. Then they doubled down by trading for Marc Gasol. In sum, the 76ers exchanged Jerryd Bayless, Robert Covington, Dario Saric, Wilson Chandler, Mike Muscala, Landry Shamet, two first-round picks and two second-round picks for Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris, a pair of stars with deals that expire at the end of the year.(Side note: At least one of these three teams has to flame out in the second round. And then what does it do? For once, the playoff drama will be in the East, if not the title.)Could it be possible that the Warriors are so dominant that they’ve convinced the rest of the NBA to change the goalposts of ultimate success? Because as it stands right now, we’ve got a set of teams that went all in on trying to get to second place. It feels more like they’re auditioning for a post-Warriors future than trying to succeed in the current landscape. Even in a world where success is narrowly defined by wins and losses, perception is everything. And some things are inherent: If the rest of the NBA can’t compete against the Warriors, they still can’t help but compete against themselves.The aftermath of the most emboldened trade request in recent NBA history has been ugly. Anthony Davis is not a Laker — or a Knick or a Celtic or a Buck for that matter. And the New Orleans Pelicans don’t seem to have much use for him either. They’d rather sit him and pile up losses, focus on the lottery race and protect Davis’ health so they can trade him in the offseason. But the NBA issued a directive: The Pelicans would be fined $100,000 for every game he sat.So it is that after playing well enough to keep the Pelicans in it, Davis was benched in the fourth quarter two games in a row. Then, against the Orlando Magic, they got blown out by 30 points, which led to Davis — chef’s kiss — criticizing the team’s effort. So things aren’t good. What’s worse: It doesn’t seem like they’re going to get any better.Thanks to the NBA’s orders, this is the only reasonable compromise for both the Pelicans and Davis. He gets to pervert his livelihood — surely important to a man who has spent so many days involuntarily sidelined by injuries — while the Pelicans at least get to lose some of the time.Here’s what it comes down to: The NBA can’t make a decision that weighs the Pelicans real interests, because it can’t be so blithely rational about what’s best for them, which is tanking. In an alternate universe with no draft lottery, the Pelicans might at least be incentivized to let Davis play when it matters to get fans in seats. But the league won’t acknowledge its worst kept secret, so a dysfunctional situation is primed to only get worse.Nothing like the 76ers to get the Boston Celtics going. And nothing like a loss to the Celtics on Tuesday night to spread anxiety in the lives of 76ers fans.Despite the addition of Tobias Harris, the 76ers lost to the Kyrie-less Celtics in the same ways they’ve habitually lost to them: The Celtics stuck like glue to the few shooters the 76ers play at the same time and treated Ben Simmons like a non-entity, while Al Horford ate Joel Embiid’s lunch. The Sixers couldn’t protect the perimeter on the other end, so they never got much of a chance to get out in transition.I won’t write them off as quickly as I did after Christmas, if only because Harris is the type of sharpshooter who could tip the scales in favor of an old-school style — if they’re willing to embrace it.Since trading for Jimmy Butler in November, the Sixers are seventh in pace, 11th in defense and 16th in offensive rebounding. This is a team with three starters who are above 6-foot-8, including the league’s most imposing center since Shaq, but it’s stuck in the middle because it’s trying to fit old-school parts into a new-school game. The league has been crashing full-tilt into more space and pace for years, so you can forgive the Sixers for trying, but you don’t win championships by playing against your strengths.Philadelphia should be slow, plodding, muscly and mean. It should crash the glass with impunity, hunt cross-matches with pick-and-rolls and bully defenders in the post. The mere idea of entering the paint against the 76ers should make opponents cower with fear.The only rub is that slowing it down doesn’t serve Ben Simmons’ style, but they’re going to have to figure out the inevitable tension between his transition-happy game and Embiid’s half-court dominance eventually. Better to do it while playing to your strengths and find out if it works now, instead of two years down the road.Following Jeremy Lin’s first game as a Raptor, he took to the podium and shared some interesting thoughts on the presence of the international media. Here are some snippets, from the Toronto Star:“Yeah, [Mandarin media] probably happens in every city that has a strong Asian contingent,” Lin said. “Happened in Atlanta as well, but not this. So again, I’m very proud to represent Asian people on a global platform, on a global scale. And for me to be here where there’s a lot of Asians, like, I used to run from it, you know?“Because that’s all anybody’s ever wanted to look for. Like, ‘Oh, he’s Asian, he’s Asian, he’s Asian.’ And I was like, talk about my basketball. But now people can see I can play, I belong in the NBA, and I’ve really embraced just being able to represent Asians and do it the right way, hopefully.“Yeah, I mean, I think I was really jaded after the New York stretch,” Lin continued. “I think there was a lot of things that happened that made me give up a little bit on people, per se. And that was a huge part of the story, and that was a huge point of contention for a lot of people as to why I was getting the publicity, or why things were the way they were.“So I kind of wanted to run from that a little bit. I would probably say three years down the road, I kind of turned a corner, and I would say being hurt for two straight years, and seeing that my Asian fan base, I don’t feel like it dropped off one bit. And I haven’t even touched the court. Like, every year I go over to Asia and I can’t even walk through the airport — it’s insane. So to see them do that after all the highs and lows, but really going through the lows post-Linsanity, which culminated in those injuries, for me, I’m still blown away. And again, that’s fed into why I want to carry myself a certain way.”I don’t have a lot to say here, except that it’s touching to see a man whose identity was leveraged and controlled by outside forces for so long get to stop running away from how he’s perceived and finally be himself: an NBA player who once turned the basketball universe on its head, an Asian-American, a God-fearing Harvard grad. He has lived long enough in the public eye that the public has finally accepted what they originally thought were contradictory traits. That, friends, is how stereotypes are broken.More from Yahoo Sports:• PGA Tour pro defends paying caddie $5K on $1.3M win • NFL bars NCAA’s all-time sack leader from combine • Only one NBA team failed to scout Antetokounmpo • Black History honor for Kaepernick sacked by lawmakers \n"

Yahoo Sports' Charles Robinson and Amanda Borges address the settlement between the players and the NFL, and what it means for their continuing efforts to promote social activism.The NBA jerseys of the future have a new feature to them: the ability to customize them after purchase by changing the name and number.In an awkward reveal reminiscent of a tech presentation, NBA commissioner Adam Silver and sportscaster Ahmad Rashad demonstrated the jersey at the NBA Tech Summit on Friday ahead of All-Star Weekend in Charlotte, switching a No. 30 Stephen Curry jersey to No. 23 Michael Jordan threads.Adam Silver just revealed the NBA jersey of the future that changes the name and number 🤯(via @NBA)pic.twitter.com/cgJk7KcIIU— Yahoo Sports (@YahooSports) February 15, 2019If Silver is trying to pull a Steve Jobs, perhaps he should stick to his day job. But in all seriousness, the jersey presents some interesting questions: Will it be easier for fans to “bandwagon”? Can players switch jerseys mid-game? Will Drake be first in line for this new prop?Meanwhile, Twitter had all of the jokes.Jersey cost only 20 easy installments of, $999.99.— Vod Kanockers (@JHoward2716) February 15, 2019Kevin Durant can now switch teams mid game with these new #NBA jerseys 😳 pic.twitter.com/a01rMkiexr— OT Sports Podcast Network (@OTSportsPod) February 15, 2019This could go one of two ways: Either the NBA will have found another way to separate itself from the other sports leagues or it will be a pointless feature that exists just because there is the technology to make it happen and for Twitter to crack jokes. In any case, you have to admit the NBA never fails to entertain.More from Yahoo Sports: • Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight When spring training camps opened this week around Major League Baseball, it brought hope that maybe, finally, Bryce Harper and Manny Machado would sign with teams and baseball’s long free-agent freeze would melt away.Nope. Not yet. Not only has that not happened, something else did happen: a number of talented young players around the league have agreed to team-friendly contract extensions.The latest was New York Yankees ace Luis Severino, who on Friday reportedly agreed to a four-year, $40 million deal. The deal, first reported by Joel Sherman of the New York Post, would buy up Severino’s arbitration years and comes with a $15 million club option for his first year of free agency.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]By agreeing to this deal, the Yankees and Severino avoid arbitration for 2019. He’ll make $4 million this season, $10 million next, then $10.25 million in 2021 and $11 million in 2022. The club option is for 2023. In the grand scheme of society, this is a very generous contract. In baseball’s economic bubble, it’s another young player signing for below-market value relative to his skills and potential.It’s hard to blame Severino for taking the deal, looking around at a free-agent world where Harper and Machado are still available, as are Dallas Keuchel and Craig Kimbrel. Especially since we haven’t heard even slight grumblings about teams being interested in Keuchel and Kimbrel.Coming off a breakout season in which he went 19-8 with a 3.39 ERA, the 25-year-old Severino was given a deal that’s pretty hard to turn down: “Do you want $40 million guaranteed, yes or no?”The other players faced with a similar question this week were Philadelphia Phillies ace Aaron Nola, who said yes to a four-year, $45 million deal Wednesday. It also avoided arbitration and bought out two of Nola’s free agency years, making it the most below-market deal of any of these.The Minnesota Twins locked up two of their talented young players Thursday, as right fielder Max Kepler agreed to a five-year, $35 million deal with a $10 million club option for 2024. It buys out three years of free agency for Kepler, 26. Shortstop Jorge Polanco also agreed to a five-year extension, his is worth $25.75 million with two option years that could keep him in Minnesota through 2025.In a vacuum, these types of extensions look like win-wins: The players get guaranteed money as they’re coming off good seasons. The clubs get cost-certainty to help them navigate the future — whether it’s the Yankees and Phillies trying to add big free agents this year or next, or a team like the Twins striving for contention with a homegrown core.In a bigger sense, though, it’s hard not to look at these deals in the current state of free agency and wonder if they’re a symptom of something else. Is it the market correcting itself? Is it baseball’s economy morphing into something new? Or maybe it’s just players looking around and saying, “Well, I better get my money now.”According to numerous reports, there’s a fear that for this generation of young players the light at the end of the tunnel — the big free-agency payday — won’t be there for them in the same way it was for so many other players.So while it’s great that stars like Justin Verlander, Clayton Kershaw and Max Scherzer are publicly speaking out about the current state of free agency, they’re on the right side of it. They got their mega deals.The younger players find themselves in a different sort of peril. It’s entirely possible that these are the biggest paydays these players ever get, which is a much different economic model that we’ve seen from baseball in the past.Whether it’s right or wrong — and that’s certainly something that’s up for debate heading into the next collective-bargaining agreement — baseball’s economy has often been backward. Players get paid less, relative to the market, in their pre-free agency years. The best recent example is Mike Trout winning the MVP in 2014 at age 22 while making $1 million.He got a raise to $6 million the next season, but in 2015 was still making a fraction of what people like Ryan Howard ($25M), Albert Pujols ($24M), Joe Mauer ($23M), Mark Teixeira ($22.5M) and Jose Reyes ($22M) were making.But that overpay is a necessary part baseball’s economic ecosystem too. It’s a fact: Players get overpaid as their careers decline. It’s almost like baseball’s way of making up for underpaying players during their early years. It’s baseball’s golden parachute. What’s happening these days is fewer teams are accepting that overpay as part of the how the system works.In the past few years, arbitration salaries have gotten higher and higher, and teams have tried harder to lock up younger stars before free agency. It’s why we’ve see players like Madison Bumgarner, Chris Archer, Chris Sale and Paul Goldschmidt become valuable trade chips for their team-friendly contract extensions.Teams are getting smarter about where their money goes, and how to keep value in their assets. These extensions to Severino, Nola and the rest show that they’re willing to spend money, just in the way that they want.Earlier this week, former Miami Marlins president David Samson tweeted something in response to Justin Verlander, saying the “broken system” talk was wrong. Players and their agents, Samson said, needed to adjust to a “new reality.”He may be right about the new reality part. The monster paydays at the end of the free agency tunnel could be fading away. If Bryce Harper and Manny Machado can’t get them, who can?The new reality could be players seizing their money. Whenever they can.– – – – – –Mike Oz is a writer at Yahoo Sports.

However, Wainwright framed the situation with a little more urgency on Friday by expressing concerns that a day of reckoning could happen sooner than later.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]Speaking to InsideSTL.com’s Tim McKernan, Wainwright said it was inevitable that the players will go on strike unless major changes are made to help bridge the widening gap. But he’s also worried that frustrations could reach a boiling point during the season leading to some form of a revolt. Perhaps even a mid-season walkout.#STLCards pitcher Adam Wainwright on @TMASTL: “Unless something changes, there’s going to be a strike. 100%. I’m just worried people are going to walk-out mid-season.” pic.twitter.com/M8WeRVcASe— Tim McKernan (@tmckernan) February 15, 2019“Unless something changes, there’s going to be a strike. 100%,” Wainwright said regarding the free-agent freeze that has left stars like Bryce Harper and Manny Machado without contracts. “I’m just worried people are going to walkout midseason.”It’s conceivable given the current climate, but a players revolt on that level still feels like a long shot. The target date we should all still be looking at is Dec. 1, 2021. That’s when the current collective bargaining agreement ends and the owners will be forced to come to the table.That doesn’t mean we should just dismiss Wainwright’s concerns about a 2019 strike. While they might feel a little on the dramatic side, the frustration that has built all offseason as dozens of free agents, including and especially Harper and Machado, remain unsigned is becoming more palpable by the day. There’s a genuine feeling that owners are determined to cut back on salaries even as profits continue to reach new heights, it’s possible the players’ patience will run out if the free-agent freeze continues to drag on. Wainwright thinks so, and he’s far from alone.In Friday’s interview, the 37-year-old right-hander also criticized owners and front offense personnel for placing too much emphasis on “analytics” and placing everything in a “sabermetric box” that discounts intangibles and other immeasurable aspects of baseball.Adam Wainwright said today on ⁦@TMASTL⁩ that he expects there to be a strike “100%.”The context of the conversation comes from a discussion on how Bryce Harper and Manny Machado are still without teams.You can see Wainwright’s reasoning in the video below. pic.twitter.com/GXsmx4cXk1— Tim McKernan (@tmckernan) February 15, 2019Wainwright admitted that there’s always risk in making long-term financial commitments to players, but emphasized that doing so marks a commitment to winning that several teams seemingly lack.“Part of it is smart from their side of it, but you have to realize it’s about winning. So, if Bryce Harper wants 10 years and he’s 26 years old. He’s going to be a dynamic player. The same can be said about Manny Machado. These guys are superstar players.”The deeper we get into it the more obvious it is that the players know what battles lie ahead. The only real question is how much worse it will get before any progress is made toward a satisfactory resolution.More from Yahoo Sports:• Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight MLB rumors: Bryce Harper has made his decision, says D.C. radio host originally appeared on nbcsportsbayarea.comA report has come out from the East Coast saying Bryce Harper has come to a decision on which team he will play for in 2019 and beyond.Chris Russell, a sports radio talk show host from 106.7 The Fan in Washington D.C., (who has been on the Harper beat for some time) said the free agent slugger could make a decision in the next 24 hours.\"Maybe I took a little bit of a leap of faith here based on some indications I got from a real good source,\" Russell told 94WIP, in Philadelphia, on Friday.\"Bryce and his representatives, (Scott) Boras, his people, his wife Kayla, they've been meeting since Monday morning in Vegas. Bryce originally wanted this done, when it took this long, by Valentine's Day. Obviously, the contract has not been announced, signed, or whatever.\"\"But I'm led to believe by the people that I've talked to that are close to the situation -- and I have, again, a real good source that has helped me through this process, let's just leave it at that,\" Russell said. \"That Bryce was in a mood to celebrate yesterday. Now, the source said, 'I believe it's done.' I don't have concrete, 100 percent proof for you guys. I wish I did, otherwise, I would have it and I would be running around with it. But I don't have that, so I want to caution everybody in Philadelphia. But that's what I was led to believe, that this thing is now decided.\"Russell then mentioned the Phillies.\"Now, what comes then is hammering out a contract. And if we were to believe the report that the Philadelphia Phillies had not even extended a formal offer -- and I assume that to be a termed, written agreement, that type of thing, which I find hard to believe -- then there might be more legwork to this. And therefore, hey the decision may be done, but the contract still needs to be ironed out.\"[RELATED: Phillies fan participates in \"lent\" in hopes of recruiting Harper]Russell is being safe with the terminology he's using, which is understandable. And while we haven't been able to confirm these rumors, Harper, along with many other free agents, remains unsigned.The Giants appeared to be the \"mystery team\" that introduced themselves late into the Harper sweepstakes -- and when the radio hosts asked Russell his opinion on where the outfielder will end up next season, he believed Harper will be in an orange and black uniform.\"I don't think it's going to be the Nationals,\" Russell said. \"I think it's going to be the San Francisco Giants, but that is not by any means an 'I know that for a fact,' so I want to caution everybody -- I know how this works -- I get in trouble with everything I say on my radio show, and everyone blows it up.\" The wait continues ... Golden State Warriors stars Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant empathised with Steve Kerr after the head coach was ejected during the loss to the Portland Trail Blazers having thrown a clipboard in response to a flagrant foul call.Kerr was enraged late in the fourth quarter when Draymond Green was called for a flagrant foul after he stopped Zach Collins from approaching the rim as he went up for a shot.That drew Kerr's ire and after ranting in one referee's face, he slammed a clipboard down to earn an ejection, with Durant having to escort his head coach back off the court.The Warriors lost the game 129-107 but will still head into the All-Star break with the best record in the Western Conference.\"It was an emotional game. We fought really hard for 43 minutes,\" Curry told reporters afterwards.\"One questionable decision - the flagrant - obviously the fire came out. You see coach go and throw a clipboard. At that point you try to get us over the hump. An eight-point swing, it's tough to overcome.\"\"I looked at the replay and the amount of ball [Green] got, there was nothing excessive about it, he got all the ball.\"There was a lot of chirping, with Zach involved. There was probably a sensitivity to it, trying to put out some fires, but I thought it was a terrible call. We obviously paid the price for it with how everything unfolded after that.\"Durant shared that sympathy having been the one to pull Kerr away from the referees as he continued to rant at them.\"I felt for him, I understand his anger and his rage, especially for that call,\" he said.\"I thought we should have just kept playing, It was a common foul, I thought. Refs looked at it differently. \"I understand why coach was a little frustrated.\"Kerr explained that it was the disbelief at the call that had triggered his reaction.\"I was just shocked that that was called a flagrant foul,\" he said. \"I'm not sure how it's determined - if it's in New York or the officials on the call - but that was head-scratching: that that could be called a flagrant foul.\"The guy's going to go in for a dunk, you've got to make sure he doesn't dunk it.\"So, I told Kenny [Mauer] that I beg to differ. There might have been a couple of other words in there too!\"I'll have to ask the owner if the clipboard broke when I threw it down. I got a little anger out so that was good. I was too busy yelling to ask for an explanation.\"Charles Barkley thinks New Orleans Pelicans star Anthony Davis made a mistake with his trade request.The 25-year-old asked the Pelicans to move him in late January and the Los Angeles Lakers had been engaged in discussions about acquiring him. But, no deal was reached before the deadline and Davis remained with New Orleans.Barkley, an 11-time All-Star who works as an analyst for TNT, said he thinks Davis and his agent, Rich Paul, mishandled the situation.\"Don't ruin your reputation as a great player, one of the nicest guys in the world,\" Barkley told reporters on Thursday ahead of All-Star weekend (via the Washington Post).\"Remember, your agent works for you, you don't work for him. They handled that situation wrong. It's going to come back to bite them in the a***. It's unfortunate.\"The six-time All-Star entered play on Thursday averaging 28.5 points and 13.1 rebounds this season. But, he scored just three points in 24 minutes on the floor in the Pelicans' 118-88 loss to the Orlando Magic earlier this week.\"This is a bad situation,\" Barkley said. \"It's a bad look for the NBA. Because that kid can't go out there and give 100 per cent because he’s worried about getting hurt. The guy's the second-best player in the world and he's got three points? That's not a good look for the NBA.\"The Boston Celtics and New York Knicks, among others, are expected to explore dealing for Davis after the season. Barkley, however, said he believes the forward will eventually land in Los Angeles because of Paul's relationship with Lakers star LeBron James.Barkley tallied 22.1 points and 11.7 rebounds per game over his 16-year career. He retired in 2000 and was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame six years later.After an apology from Sergio Garcia, a non-apology from Matt Kuchar, and an uncooperative Mother Nature on Valentine's Day, it's time for everyone to focus again on Tiger Woods. Kidding. Sort of. A weather-delayed first round at Riviera re-starts on Friday morning and the 14-time major champ will be in the Hollywood-area spotlight as he finally begins his Genesis Open. And golf fans could potentially see a LOT of the tournament host as the event tries to play catch up after heavy rains on Thursday.Woods, Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas (Decent group, eh?) are scheduled to tee off at 8:32 local time (11:32 ET). The hope is they will complete their first rounds and then play as much of their second rounds as possible before darkness. And Tiger's hope is to finally win for the first time at this historic layout where he missed the cut last year. We'll be tracking Tiger every step of the way so keep it right here for the latest scores, news and highlights. (All times eastern)SATURDAY, 11:25: With a 25-foot birdie putt on No. 9, Woods' final hole of the second round, Tiger will likely make the cut. The birdie brought Woods back to even on his round and to one under overall.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096808527694245890After resuming play in the morning, Woods bogeyed his first hole, No. 4, then made four pars before his finishing birdie. His playing partners, however, fared much better. Justin Thomas shares the lead with Adam Scott at 11 under and Rory McIlroy birdied four of his six holes on Saturday morning to shoot 63 and move to seven under through 36 holes. Thursday's early wave is now on the course for their second rounds.-------------------FRIDAY-------------------8:25: And with that, the horn has sounded—play will be suspended for darkness on Friday at Riviera. Tiger, JT and Rory have six more holes to complete their second round. Justin Thomas is at 10-under, tied with Adam Scott for the lead. Tiger will hope Saturday brings some different momentum for him—as this marathon day ends with two bogeys in a row after the highlight eagle.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10965708926692065298:21: That's back-to-back bogeys now for Tiger Woods, dropping another shot here at the third hole (his 12th of the round). And over his past six holes, Tiger has four bogeys. The birdie at No. 1 helped negate most of that damage ... but Tiger's back to 1-under again—right on the current cut line.8:13: On his 30th hole of the day, Tiger is showing some obvious signs of being tired. And who could blame him—he's been playing golf for nearly 10 hours straight. From 165 yards out at the third hole, Tiger Woods tries to chop out a 6-iron and comes out of it. His ball comes to rest short of the green. With sunset in Pacific Palisades being 5:30 local time, this group will have time for maybe one more hole today.8:04: Tiger follows up that eagle putt at No. 1 with a bogey at the second hole. The third bogey of his second round moves Tiger back to 2-under overall.7:56: After a long wait at the second hole, Tiger sprays his second shot from 235 out with a fairway wood out to the right. He'll have his work cut out from the front right bunker to save par at the 482-yard par 4.7:40: This is exactly what Tiger Woods needed: He rolls in his 43-foot eagle putt at his 10th hole (the first) to get back to 3-under—negating those two bogeys he made on his front nine. What a putt! With the flagstick in!https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096570892669206529Tiger made a disappointing par to open his first round earlier today at the first hole. The unlikely eagle makes up for that effort—and could turn around Tiger's second round in a dramatic way. Tiger goes from toeing the cut line at 1-under to now all of a sudden being T-21.7:28: Tiger finds the fairway at the par-5 first hole, the group's 10th hole of their second round, as he attempts to get a shot back here after bogeying two of his final three holes on his front nine. Neither bogey was particularly bad—the 18th hole is playing brutally tough right now uphill and into the wind with the rain, making it even more of a challenging hole. And his break at 16 was very unlucky.7:16: Tiger and JT are gonna have their work cut out to save par at the 18th hole (their ninth). Each player had fairway wood approaches and tried playing a big cut. JT was way up left on the hill—Tiger was closer. He went high with his approach and will have about 11 feet left for par.Tiger misses the par putt, so he'll drop a shot along with JT as they make the turn. Tiger moves back to 1-under after 27 holes. That's where the cut line currently is—so all of a sudden, Tiger must be concerned about making the cut.7:01: Following Justin Thomas throwing a dart at the 17th to about 3 feet, Tiger puts his wedge shot from under 100 yards to outside 20 feet, so he'll be disappointed with that effort. The birdie putt misses on the high side, and Tiger taps in for par to remain at 2-under. His playing partner and buddy Justin Thomas stays hot, rolling in a fourth straight birdie to get to 9-under—tied for the lead with Adam Scott. Really impressive golf here from JT.6:54: The rain is really coming down now as the players head to the 17th hole. Tiger finds the fairway at the par-5 17th hole, but it was a short one—he has 326 yards left. Most players have been laying up at this par 5 all day.6:43: From a brutal position up against the back lip of the bunker, Tiger hacks it out—and somehow keeps the ball on the green, albeit the back portion. His par attempt from 44 feet away here comes up three feet shy. Tiger makes his bogey to move back to 2-under.Meanwhile, Justin Thomas is officially on fire. He has another birdie after a fabulous tee shot at 16. It's now two Kentucky boys tied at the top: Justin Thomas and J.B. Holmes (-8).https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10965576791939317766:39: Tiger will have serious lie issues at the par-3 16th hole. His tee shot came to rest up against the back lip of the bunker. As Billy Kratzert just remarked on PGA Tour Live, Tiger will do well just to keep this ball on the green. Though he avoided dropping a shot on his last hole, there might be a bogey in his future here.6:35: A clutchhh par save by Tiger at the 15th hole makes up for his poor chip—and Tiger keeps the momentum going on his second round, as he stays 3-under for the tournament and 2-under on the round.Justin Thomas, also in Tiger's group, holed out from in front of the green for birdie at the 14th hole, and he makes a long birdie putt at 15 to get to 7-under—just one back of fellow Kentucky native J.B. Holmes.6:32: A poor chip shot from Tiger at the 15th hole leaves him about 13 feet away. He'll need to convert that putt to prevent dropping his first shot of his second round.6:24: Tiger finds another fairway here at Riviera, this one at the 15th hole. The guy is feeeling it with his driver. Almost on auto pilot. His approach from 190 out turns a little too much, finding the rough to the left of the green. He'll have to get up and down to avoid dropping one here.6:20: From 20 feet out, Tiger's birdie bid comes up shy—never really scaring the hole, despite getting a good look at the line from Rory's putt. Tiger taps in for par to remain at 3-under.The putter has been disappointing for Tiger all day: He had 34 putts in his first round, including four three-putts, just the third time in his career he's done that.6:13: Tiger puts his tee shot at the par-3 14th hole just inside Rory's ball—about 20 feet right of the hole. He'll get a little teach from Rory's putt, too, as Tiger continues to hit it well today.6:07: Tiger just misses the left-to-right curling bid for birdie, leaving himself with an easy par at 13. He stays 3-under for the tournament and -2 through four on his round.Tiger's playing partners are also playing well—Rory has three birdies in his first four holes to get to 2-under. Look out for Rory at rainy Riviera. And Justin Thomas, despite hitting his tee shot out of bounds at 13, got up and down from 160 yards to avoid dropping multiple shots. He's now 5-under after that bogey.6:02: Another grooved tee shot for Tiger Woods at the 13th hole puts him in good position. He turned over his tee shot—putting his draw in the middle of the fairway at the dogleg left. Tiger spins his approach back to about 15 feet, just off the green in the fringe. He'll have a chance to knock another one here and keep the momentum going.5:51: Bang! Tiger nails the 25-footer for birdie at the 12th hole to add a second birdie to his card through three holes. Realistically, too, it could be three straight birdies for Tiger. But the 14-time major champion is now 2-under through 3—T-3 for the tournament (T-19)—and carries some strong momentum on his side at the start of his second round ... as the rain is coming down at Riviera.5:46: Tiger hits his approach hole high—about 25 feet from 181 yards. He'll have another chance to add a birdie to his third round.Tiger's currently at 2-under, which puts him at T-29. The projected cut is at 1-under—so he's comfortably inside the number as of now. But there's a ton of golf to be played, obviously.5:41: Tiger finds the fairway with his driver at the par-4 12th hole. The 12th usually plays as one of the toughest holes at Riviera—we'll see if Tiger can take advantage of his position here in the fairway.5:33: An excellent fairway-wood second shot by Tiger put him right in front of the par-5 11th green in two. But a very poor approach putt for his third leaves him more than 10 feet away. His birdie try slides by for a very disappointing par being so close in 2. That should've been a golden opportunity to start his second round with two birdies—instead, Tiger stays at 2-under.5:12: Tiger goes high with his pitch—having to navigate around the front bunker, and plays it nicely—spinning it about 7 feet short of the hole. So Tiger will have a good look for an opening birdie to start his second round. Tiger converts the birdie putt to move to 2-under.5:02: Only a little more than a half hour after finishing his first round, Tiger Woods (-1) -- along with Justin Thomas (-5) and Rory McIlroy (+1) -- has teed off in his second round. The group started on the drivable 10th hole, and Tiger has driven his tee shot just off the green. He'll have a chance to put his pitch shot close to start his second round with a birdie.4:24: Tiger narrowly misses the birdie putt at the 18th hole, so he'll tap in for a par and an opening-round, one-under 70 at Riviera. Having three-putted for a fourth time on the 17th hole to drop a shot in disappointing fashion, Tiger will head to his second round a bit frustrated. But the four consecutive birdies showed him being able to score well at Riviera, where he has never won.Tiger, JT (who birdied 18 to finish at 5-under) and Rory will head right back for their second round in this marathon day for them.4:18: Tiger responds to that shocking three-putt with a perfect drive and a towering 6-iron on Riviera's famed 18th. Woods is in good shape to at least make par the difficult hole, but as we've seen all day, a two-putt is anything but automatic.Here's an unusual stat on Tiger three-putting four times this afternoon. He's making some history in a bad way...https://twitter.com/JustinRayGolf/status/10965196250582507574:06: So much for the momentum. . . After a decent approach shot that spins back to about 20 feet, Woods runs his birdie putt a couple feet by and. . . gulp. . . misses the comebacker from about two feet. Wow. That's four three-putts on the day as Tiger falls back to one under with one hole to play.3:57: Uh-oh, it's raining in southern California again. Meanwhile, Woods is plodding his way up the par-5 17th. After pulling his drive into the left rough and drawing a poor lie, Woods pushed his layup slightly into the first cut of the right rough. He'll have a some sort of wedge to a back-right hole location.3:50: Tiger's tee shot was tracking on the par-3 16th, but it comes up about 30 feet short. From there, he two-putts for par to remain at two under. Justin Thomas makes his 10-foot birdie effort to move to four under, while Rory McIlroy remains at one over. McIlroy hast two holes to avert his first over-par score of 2019.3:40: After another great drive and a solid approach, Woods races his birdie attempt nearly five feet past the hole. But he keeps the overall positive momentum going by converting the par putt to remain at two under. Tiger has three more holes to play. At least, before he gets a lunch break.3:24: BANG! There's the bounce back from Tiger. It just came one hole later. And from farther away as Woods drains his 12-footer for birdie on No. 14.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096507996031467520Woods is now back to two under, five shots behind Jordan Spieth, who has to be pleased to still be in front by two despite these soft conditions.3:17: Tiger hits a great shot on the difficult par-3 14th hole to about 15 feet. He'll have a good look at birdie coming up. In the meantime, here's a look at how the leader board stands with Jordan Spieth still leading the way.Jordan Spieth (-7) 2t. Tony Finau (-5) 2t. Patrick Rodgers (-5) 2t. Kramer Hickok (-5) 2t. Davis Love III (-5) 2t. Adam Scott (-5) 2t. J.B. Homes (-5)Click here for full scores.3:13: Woods stuck his approach to about four feet below the hole on No. 13. A bounce back birdie looked like a forgone conclusion until he pushed his effort. Woof. That's two three-putts and two short misses on the greens for Tiger today. He remains at one under. Meanwhile, Rory McIlroy, after getting to two under through eight, has fallen to one over after back-to-back bogeys. Justin Thomas, the third player in the group, continues to lead this trio at three under.3:05: After hitting fade after fade, Woods steps to the 13th tee and rips a draw around the corner, perfectly setting up his next shot. Good to see him working it both ways with ease.3:01: Tiger pushed his tee shot into the right rough, then hit a fantastic recovery shot from a thick lie onto the green. He had a long look at birdie that rolled about four feet past, leaving him with a tricky left-to-right par putt, which he missed. That's three three putts on the day for Woods, and he's still one under.2:39: Not the best chip from Woods, as he left himself about six feet for birdie, but he makes it anyway. Four straight for Tiger to get to two under for the day.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10964952191957975042:30: Woods rips a 3-wood from 269 to just in front of the green. Hate to jinx him, but there's no reason he shouldn't easily make his fourth straight birdie here (ducks).2:20: Three in a row for Woods as he rolls in another at No. 10 and moves to one under. If he finds the fairway again at the 11th, four in a row will be in his sights. Meanwhile, Rory makes his par to stay at one under and JT ends up holing his 10 footer for birdie to get to four under. Finally a little bit of JUICE from this threesome.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096489287753711616https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096489787672780800By the way, it looks like we know when they'll be heading back out for round two later today. Here's an update from the Tiger Tracker:https://twitter.com/GCTigerTracker/status/1096481806067523585That should give them enough time to get at least 11 or 12 holes in.At the 11th, Woods stripes another drive down the fairway. He's really starting to cook.2:12: Tiger's shot was a tad more difficult than we thought, as he had to avoid a bunker and take it up high to get it back to the pin. He was successful, sticking it to about three feet. Hell of a shot. Even better was Rory's shot, as he flopped it from a nice lie and got it to hang on just off the back of the green and stay out of the back bunker. Thomas, who had the easiest shot, put too much spin on his chip, leaving himself with about 10 feet for birdie.2:07: Finally, Tiger, Rory and JT hit their tee shots, and it looks like the ensuing entertainment will be well worth the wait. Tiger is in the collection area left of the green, where he has a straightforward chip that should set him up with a good chance to make birdie. Thomas is just in front of the green, and he'll have a great chance to make a birdie as well. Rory ... um ... not so much. He's in the rough with a greenside bunker in front of him and a pin he won't be able to get close to, and just holding the green would be a miracle.1:52: Woods drains his four-footer for bird and turns in even par 35. Real strong finish to his opening nine, and now it looks like he'll have a long wait at the 10th. DeChambeau, Kuchar and Rahm have still yet to hit their tee shots.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10964831254067896321:47: Tiger had just 122 left to the green and stuck one in there close. He has four feet left for birdie to turn in even par, which would be a small victory after that ugly three putt back at No. 7. Not to mention he'll have a prime opportunity to get into red figures at the driveable par-4 10th.1:41: Woods cranks another high fade right down the middle with the driver at No. 9. With the tees up today, he'll have a low iron in his hand for his approach.1:34: And he's on the board! Woods bounces back with a birdie putt from 15 feet, getting him back to one over. We'll see if that gets him going before making the turn.1:30: From 125 yards out, Woods hit a wedge and hated it from the second he made contact. While he did pull it, he's still hole high and inside 20 feet. Hideki Matsuyama-esque move from Tiger.1:24: Woods rips one right down the middle at the par-4 eighth. Should have a short iron in.1:15: Tiger's birdie putt was actually from just off the green on the fringe, and he rolled it by some four feet. Then, he missed the comebacker for par, dropping to two over on the day. Oof.1:09: Fairway and a green for Woods at the seventh. Good look at birdie coming up to get back to level par.12:58: Another hole, another par for Woods, who two-putted from 24 feet on the par-3 sixth. In the group up ahead, though, Jon Rahm is making a move at three under through six.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/109646557828021452912:47: Another meh hole for Tiger on No. 5, just missing the fairway with his tee shot, finding the front of the green with a so-so approach, and two-putting for another par from 43 feet. Woods remains at one over through five holes while his playing partners, McIlroy and Thomas, both remain at one under.12:42: As Matt Kuchar's ball is in the air on the par-3 sixth, a fan yells, \"Go low—just not with the gratuity!\" Despite Matt maintaining this is \"not a story,\" it is. And this won't be the last comment like this.12:29: Woods hit a nice shot to about 15 feet on the par-3 fourth, but ran his birdie effort by the hole. Still one over. Still no highlights. At least, from Tiger. Here was Spieth's closing birdie from about an hour ago, because there is not much else exciting going on right now.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/109644546143346688112:17: Another missed fairway and another short approach from Tiger on the par-4 third. Although, Woods found the putting surface, he was unable to two-putt from 63 feet, missing a seven-footer for par after badly misreading his first putt. That drops Tiger to one over through three holes. Not a lot of highlights so far. . .12:02: Tiger misses right off the tee on No. 2 then comes up short on another approach. But his pitch shot nearly goes down, leaving him with a tap-in par. Even par through two holes.11:49: After that perfect opening tee shot, Tiger hit a hideous approach with a 5-iron that came up way short in a fairway bunker. From there, he hit his third to 10 feet but missed the putt to walk away with a disappointing par. Both of Tiger's playing partners, McIlroy and Thomas, make birdie.11:38: Matt Kuchar just misses his eagle attempt from 25 feet on No. 1, but taps in for birdie. Kuchar has been in the news a lot this week over a caddie controversy dating back to his win at the Mayakoba Golf Classic. A controversy he didn't help with his comments on Wednesday. Is it possible some of those \"Kuuuuch\" shouts will turn to \"Mooooch\"? Kinda sounded like it on the first hole. . .11:34: Jordan Spieth is in with a seven-under-par 64 to take the early lead. Spieth needed only 21 putts during his bogey-free round. Of course, starting tournaments hasn't been a problem for Spieth of late. Finishing, however, has been a different story. Incredibly, Spieth is looking for his first win since the 2017 British Open and his first top 5 since last year's Masters.11:32: Woods smashes a driver off the first tee that finds the fairway. The opening par 5 at Riviera is essentially a long par 4 and one of the easiest holes on the PGA Tour all year so Tiger is thinking at least birdie after that tee shot.10:53: So far, so good on the Friday weather:https://twitter.com/GCTigerTracker/status/1096437235262533632And with lift, clean and place in play (for at least the first round), low scores are out there. Let's set the over/under on the Par-71 layout at 68.5.10:45: We are approximately 45 minutes away from Tiger's tee time and it's another major champ who is already off to a fantastic start. Jordan Spieth has the lead at six under through 15 holes. Spieth leads Patrick Rodgers by one and then there's a big group at four under, including Bill Haas, who is playing in the event a year after being involved in a car accident during last year's tournament that killed a friend he was staying with. Make sure you read Brian Wacker's piece from earlier in the week on how Haas is still trying to move on from that tragedy.10:35: As we move within an hour from Tiger teeing off, check out GOLFTV's latest behind-the-scenes video with Woods in which he says his bag has up to 16(!) golf gloves during rainy rounds and he explains why he doesn't like wearing rain jackets:https://twitter.com/GOLFTV/status/1096246456795697153\"Pops used to say, 'Once you're wet, you're wet.

Once he started running the front office, his blinking at Paul George on national TV contributed to the Lakers getting fined again for tampering. Johnson’s praise of Giannis Antetokounmpo drew yet another tampering fine.So, though he escaped punishment for his recent comments on 76ers guard Ben Simmons, Johnson refused to answer a question about Hornets guard Kemba Walker.Carolina Blitz:Asked Magic about Kemba and he said y’all aren’t going to catch him slipping anymore. pic.twitter.com/sQZtIWnQbn— Carolina Blitz (@KeepBlitzin) February 15, 2019Johnson:You know I can’t answer any questions about no players, because every time I do it, I get fined. But anybody else do it, they don’t get fined. So I’m going to stay away from that one.I don’t blame Johnson for feeling that way.Other teams’ owners, coaches and executives have repeatedly publicly discussed rival players without facing announced punishment.To be fair, the NBA doesn’t reveal every fine. Bucks owner Marc Lasry reportedly just got fined for tampering, but the league never announced it. But, at minimum, there’s an inconsistency with how the NBA exposes Johnson’s transgressions.Even NBA commissioner Adam Silver said last year there’s a spotlight on the Lakers due to prior tampering. That strikes me as unfair. The Lakers already paid for their prior violations and should now be held to the same standard as everyone else.And for what it’s worth, I wish that standard allowed an all-time great point guard like Johnson to publicly share his thoughts on Kemba Walker.Gareth Bale has landed himself in hot water after La Liga denounced the Real Madrid star for his celebration in the Madrid derby, which could carry a ban of four to 12 games.The Welsh forward scored as a substitute in the 3-1 victory over Atletico Madrid, bringing up his 100th goal for the club.And during the celebrations that followed, Bale \"lifted his right arm near his head in a clear sign of provocation towards the fans, then giving a gesture which could be seen as obscene and disdainful by folding his arm and striking it with his other hand.\"In a statement released by La Liga, Bale’s punishment will be decided by whether he incited the crowd or not.If Bale is guilty of “inciting opposition fans” to cause a hostile reaction, the punishment could carry four to 12 games, if there was no hostile reaction but intent, then it could be as little as one to three games.The gesture is referred to in Spain as ‘corte de mangas,’ with the moment not picked up in the referee’s match report.A committee will now decide whether the gesture merits a punishment.Bale also featured in Real’s Champions League victory over Ajax.Los Blancos take a 2-1 lead back to the Bernabeu for the second leg of the last 16 tie after Marco Asensio’s late winner.Earlier this week Heisman Trophy winner — and first round draft pick of the Oakland Athletics — Kyler Murray chose football over baseball, committing himself to the NFL draft.

In the last month alone he's won his 44th PGA Tour event, finished second in another, hit every fairway in a round for the first time in 21 years, shot a 60, pulled off this impossible recovery shot, gone viral just by rolling his eyes and said he might drop the Players from his schedule because he's already won it (a literal mic drop). The man simply cannot be stopped right now.Leave it to the weather to literally rain on Lefty's parade. On Thursday at the Genesis Open, Mickelson began his first round at the difficult short par-4 10th and drove into one of the bunkers up near the green, leaving him with a dreaded lengthy sand shot. He wound up hitting it over the green, and his ball plugged in the back bunker, setting up an even harder shot than he just had. As you'll hear PGA Tour Live commentator Shane Bacon say, avoiding making a six was probably the goal, but after Mickelson hit his third into another bunker on the other side of the green, a six suddenly became best-case scenario. How does a four sound instead?https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096076528142626818Find us a more Phil Mickelson par ever... you can't. He's always got a flair for the dramatic. The problem?

(Old man golfers)The dust is barely settled in the wake of the end of the Markelle Fultz era in Philadelphia, and the former 76ers guard is already taking shots at his old team.His old coach Brett Brown in particular.Fultz had his introductory press conference with the Orlando Magic on Thursday after being traded at last week’s deadline and praised his new coach Steve Clifford while taking a veiled shot at Brown.“It just excites me to know that I have a coach that’s going to push you to be better and not just going to tell you what you want to hear,” Fultz said.That’s direct praise for his new coach. But the message for Brown is clear. Fultz didn’t like what he heard from the Philadelphia coaching staff.Fultz never had any public dispute with the 76ers, but it was evident that he and the team had different approaches to the struggles that saw him shoot 41.4 percent from the field, 26.7 percent from 3-point distance and 53.4 percent from the line in limited action after being selected as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2017 draft.It’s still not clear whether injury or a mental block – or both – are the cause of his shooting issues.After his agent announced that the nerve disorder thoracic outlet syndrome was the root of the shooting woes, Fultz never played again for the 76ers.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]Fultz appears to be fully embracing the fresh start in Orlando as a player and a person.“I think the biggest thing we talked about what doing thing the right way,” Fultz said. “Just building me up both as a man and on the court. I think that’s music to my ears, really just. Two things I really want to do is be the best player I can be and be the best young man I can be.”Fultz described the experience of his nerve disorder to reporters.“It’s hard to lift up your arms, you lose feeling in your fingers,” Fultz said. “You can’t tell when it’s going to happen. It’s not like you do the same motion every time. You get tingling in your fingers, numbness. Stuff like that.”He also curtly dismissed any notion that his shooting struggles are due to anything but injury.“I had an injury,” Fultz said. “I was out there trying to play through that. I never lost confidence.”Asked about a timetable to return, Fultz dodged the question to talk about rehab.“Right now it’s just about getting everything the right way,” he said. “Rehab’s been going great. I’m just taking my time and doing everything the right way.”More from Yahoo Sports: • PGA Tour pro defends paying caddie $5K on $1.3M win • NFL bars NCAA’s all-time sack leader from combine • Only one NBA team failed to scout Antetokounmpo • Black History honor for Kaepernick sacked by lawmakers He might not be well known to NFL fans at large, but New England Patriots fans know linebacker Kyle Van Noy — acquired basically for free from the Detroit Lions at the 2016 trade deadline — has been a big part of the defense the last two years, and has a knack for making plays at the right time.Van Noy is getting a little shine after winning his second Super Bowl ring with New England, appearing on the “Pardon My Take” podcast on Thursday to dish on all things Patriots and Super Bowl LIII.One thing that Van Noy revealed: the Los Angeles Rams didn’t do anything surprising during the game on offense.“I couldn’t believe that,” Van Noy said. “They really didn’t do — not one wrinkle. I was like, ‘What the hell?’ They’ve got so many good players, they’ve got so many things they’ve done all year, and the one play they gave us which was a wrinkle was the [Brandin] Cooks screen that hit for a little bit.“And that was it… Or maybe too, we were playing so good they were like, ‘[Expletive], we don’t know what to do.’ ”Hindsight, of course, is 20-20, but given that the Patriots’ coaching staff is known for having its players prepared for any and everything, it seems unwise that Los Angeles didn’t add some new plays or looks to try to stump New England.Van Noy said the Patriots’ culture, specifically coach Bill Belichick’s practice of not sparing anyone in the film room, even Tom Brady, is part of why the team continues to win.“Oh yeah. Yeah, that [stuff is] sick, to be honest, because it sets the table,” Van Noy said. “Like, OK, it doesn’t matter who you are, everyone’s on an even playing field. This is how it is here at work. You come in and you earn everything.“And I respect that because I felt like that gave me a chance to get on the field when I came in mid-year, and [Belichick] was like, ‘It doesn’t matter who you are or what you’ve done. You earn your keep.’ ”More from Yahoo Sports: • Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight The Brady Conundrum: How do you go about replacing the GOAT? originally appeared on nbcsportsboston.comThe Patriots hatched a Tom Brady succession plan after the 2013 season when they drafted Jimmy Garoppolo.Brady blew that up.Now, five years, four Super Bowl appearances, three Super Bowl wins, two Super Bowl MVPs and a regular-season MVP later, it's time to gingerly -- caaaauuuuuutiooooousssssllllyyyyy -- begin the process again.This time should be different.Even though Brady's contract hasn't been extended past the 2019 season, the love and happiness we saw on the field after the Rams were dispatched in SB53 is a good sign.MORE PATRIOTSAreas of Change: Will Pats be able to retain free agents Trey Flowers and Trent Brown?Brady's wariness about the Patriots' plans for him, and Bill Belichick's wariness about wedding his team to a quarterback who's closer to 50 years old than he is to 30, has dissipated.Once a new deal is in place -- Jonathan Kraft indicated that might be before training camp, though as of the Super Bowl conversations hadn't started -- Brady will have a written assurance that he will leave the Patriots and the NFL on his terms.That wasn't the case in early 2014 when the soon-to-be-37-year-old Brady saw the Patriots spend a first-round pick on a defensive tackle (Dominique Easley) and their second-rounder on Garoppolo. That, after a '13 season Brady spent throwing to the likes of Aaron Dobson, Josh Boyce, Kenbrell Thompkins and Austin Collie.Garoppolo was a stick of dynamite under Brady's behind. He was the existential threat Brady feared made flesh.Jimmy might have thought he was drafted to learn how to play quarterback in the NFL and have a nice career. To Brady, Garoppolo was there to take his job, throw his career into upheaval, uproot his family and see Brady cast out into the NFL wilderness.MORE PATRIOTSPerry: If Beckham is on the trade block, should Patriots be willing to pay the price?And, in contrast to the guy Brady succeeded in 2001 (and, by extension, did all those things to), Brady wasn't going to snort derisively at the plucky little draft pick here to take his job. He would crush the threat.He did.Brady played so well that -- despite Garoppolo developing into a bona-fide front-line quarterback under Belichick and Josh McDaniels (and Brady) -- Brady left the ever-prepared Patriots with no recourse when Garoppolo's contract was about to expire.Brady was too good to bench and too important to trade. Garoppolo was too expensive to franchise and too smart to take a \"bridge\" contract so he could watch Brady from the sidelines while his own hair started to gray at the temples.

And the complex question of how to find the player who will eventually replace the greatest quarterback in NFL history still lingers.Do you draft his successor? If you do, do you do it this year? Do you do it next year?Do you try to get into the top 10 to get your pick of the litter? Do you stay put, confident that the muttonheads across the league will miss out as they did with Brady and Garoppolo (or Aaron Rodgers, Russell Wilson, Drew Brees, Brett Favre, Johnny Unitas . . . you get the point)? How much will it cost to get into the top 10? Do you package picks from this season -- when you will have six in the first three rounds -- and pick a sucker who will suck next year and fleece them for their 2020 first-rounder? How high do you have to go for a blue-chip, given the number of first-round quarterbacks that will be taken this year and that were taken in 2018?Is it a trade for somebody another team's given up on or has no work for, like San Francisco's Nick Mullens? A veteran who will hit free agency like Nick Foles, Case Keenum or Teddy Bridgewater?How does the successor play the position? Similar to Brady in that brain/eyes/accuracy/commitment trumps legs/arm strength/versatility?MORE PATRIOTSShould Pats be interested in Demaryius Thomas? No . . . and yesOr is there an embrace of the fact that trying to find a quarterback similar to a guy who came into the league after four years at Michigan at the end of last century with a once-in-a-lifetime work ethic is a pipe dream?Aside from who the successor is and how he plays, can Brady -- the lion in winter -- be tapped to help groom whoever is being brought aboard to take over?Brady -- contrary to sexed-up speculation -- didn't actively undermine Garoppolo at any point. They were teammates. He helped Garoppolo play the position better. They became close. But he wasn't quite showing him his world, either. Brady is famous for saying he's not giving away his secrets to younger quarterbacks until after he's done.With the end-date likely to be agreed upon when he signs an extension, does he become more a mentor so that the success of the franchise has a better chance to continue after he leaves? Would the Patriots want him to do that?Or would they want a blank(ish) slate to work with that isn't saying, \"But Tom said . . . \" when they try to shape him to succeed?And that contract? What's it look like? Does Brady demand pay commensurate with what he's accomplished? Is he in the mood to do the team another financial solid given the only bump they have him in 2018 was incentives he never reached? How does that impact the structure of the team?These questions aren't new. What is new is the level of angst and anxiousness. It's dissipated tremendously.That won't make finding his replacement or choosing the means by which the Patriots will do it any easier.

Before the team's loss to the Blazers on Wednesday night, he told ESPN that he \"wants to finish his career as a Warrior.\"      View this post on Instagram    Klay wants to stay in The Bay.A post shared by  espn (@espn) on Feb 13, 2019 at 9:23pm PSTThompson is set to be an unrestricted free agent at the end of the 2018-19 season.This isn't the first time Klay has made his feelings known. Even his father Mychal, who played five seasons for the Lakers, believes his son will re-sign with the Warriors. [RELATED: For Steve Kerr, Steph Curry and Klay Thompson are mix of NBA past and present]The Warriors selected Thompson with the No. 11 overall pick in the 2011 NBA Draft. Since then, he's been a five-time NBA All-Star, three-time Finals champion and two-time All-NBA selection. Anything could happen, but it's safe to say the Klay and the Dubs have quite the relationship and are ready to tie the knot.Jason Witten never worked with Kellen Moore as a coach, but he did practice with Moore when both of them were still active players with the Cowboys.That experience is enough for Witten to think Moore has “a way about him” that will pay off in his new job as the Cowboys offensive coordinator. Witten said this week that he believes Moore will be innovative and that the offense will take a “big step” by gearing things around quarterback Dak Prescott.“Yeah, I think he will do the things that Dak likes to do,” Witten said, via the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. “He will do the things they have to do to win. That is the way they have to play. I think they will use the pass to set up the run. Not just the run to set up the pass. I think he will add some nice wrinkles to that offense.”With head coach Jason Garrett coaching in the final year of his contract, Moore’s work with the offense will have a lot to do with how Dallas does in 2019 and with the path the team charts in the years that follow. If Witten’s correct, that path will probably look a lot like the one they’ve been on for a while.The story of Danny Ainge's Greece visit to watch Giannis Antetokounmpo is a wild one originally appeared on nbcsportsboston.comThe Boston Celtics took an early interest in Greece basketball star Giannis Antetokounmpo before he was selected in the 2013 NBA Draft.C's president of basketball operations Danny Ainge actually went over to Europe to watch Antetokounmpo play, and the postgame scene was nothing short of crazy.Fans were going wild, and some of them even yelled at Ainge because they thought he was associated with Antetokounmpo's team -- Ainge was sitting near its bench during the game.Check out the video below to hear the wild story of Ainge's scouting visit to Greece:Time for another \"Finding Giannis\" outtake. The first NBA team to scout Giannis was the Boston Celtics. As is often the case in Greece, hilarity ensued, as told by @GrgpanouOCT about Danny Ainge's visit. #FindingGiannis will be broadcasted Saturday on TNT at 630pm EST. pic.twitter.com/8bLjIjHv77— Jonathan Givony (@DraftExpress) February 14, 2019The Celtics liked what they saw from Antetokounmpo, but they decided to take Gonzaga forward/center Kelly Olynyk with their 2013 first-round pick instead. The C's made a trade with the Dallas Mavericks (who owned the No. 13 pick) to select Olynyk, whose ability to handle the ball and shoot well from the outside as a big man was appealing.Antetokounmpo ultimately was taken by the Milwaukee Bucks with the 15th pick. The \"Greek Freak\" has since become one of the league's best players and arguably is the leading candidate for MVP this season. It's still hard to fault Ainge and other executives for passing on Antetokounmpo, though. He was a very raw talent, and other players in that draft class were expected to provide more immediate contributions.Click here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!

They run the same plays over and over again. All they do is flop and shoot free throws. Maybe they’re even ruining basketball. Who isn’t these days, right?Houston’s offense operates with rigid discipline. The Rockets run and run James Harden off screens until he finds a tenable matchup to exploit. Tenable, so we’re clear, is a loosely defined term for a player who only needs a sliver of space to shoot from anywhere on the floor, whose combined ball-handling and strength psychs out defenders and referees alike.It is repetitive, sure, but in a way that’s endlessly fascinating. The Rockets repeatedly put the ball in the hands of the one of the NBA’s most creative, destructive scorers and wait for him to find a sieve — or create one. Harden now holds the second-longest 30-point scoring streak in NBA history, breaking 31 games in Wednesday night’s loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves, and he’s averaging a league-scorching 36.5 points per game.I’d argue all that makes the Rockets more watchable than most teams, which dilly-dally for possessions at a time, only looking to optimize in the face of urgency. You won’t find any freewheeling action from Iguodala-types in Houston. Even Austin Rivers has (mostly) held himself in check. Every time I turn on a Rockets game, Harden or Chris Paul has possession of the ball and is on the cusp of doing something. The game becomes a successive highlight reel that doesn’t allow you to turn the dial.The same quality that makes the Rockets so entertaining right now — and will likely garner Harden a second MVP — might be what hurts them in the playoffs again. The fuse is burning bright: Harden holds the ball an average of 9.6 seconds when he touches it, the highest mark in the NBA. His usage rate is 39 percent, smashing second place by 7 percent. What Harden’s doing might not be the best idea for the Rockets’ future outlook.But it’s definitely not boring. Even on defense, an opponent can make a name for himself with a signature moment against Harden — just ask Josh Okogie.As for as Harden’s high free-throw attempts bogging the game down, I won’t be convinced that a generation that cuts away to their iPhone screen 50 times per day is that bothered by an opportunity to look away from the action. When Harden’s playing, it’s the only chance you’re going to get.Because it seems like it, at least in the East. For the past few weeks, the dominant Warriors storyline has been about how Kevin Durant’s impending free agency could impact their title run. After a win against the Utah Jazz two nights ago, Durant said he feels the team is not playing well. These are the same Warriors, mind you, who are 16-3 since the New Year. Not only have they won all 11 games DeMarcus Cousins has played in — they’ve blown the tops off buildings, outscoring opponents by 9.7 points per 100 possessions. Until July 1, Warriors inevitability reigns.Why is it, then, that the Eastern Conference is littered with high-end teams that made big bets on winning this year? The Boston Celtics made their bed a while ago, with Kyrie Irving’s contract expiring when the season ends. The Toronto Raptors traded franchise cornerstone DeMar DeRozan for a chance to woo Kawhi Leonard for a season. Then they doubled down by trading for Marc Gasol. In sum, the 76ers exchanged Jerryd Bayless, Robert Covington, Dario Saric, Wilson Chandler, Mike Muscala, Landry Shamet, two first-round picks and two second-round picks for Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris, a pair of stars with deals that expire at the end of the year.(Side note: At least one of these three teams has to flame out in the second round. And then what does it do? For once, the playoff drama will be in the East, if not the title.)Could it be possible that the Warriors are so dominant that they’ve convinced the rest of the NBA to change the goalposts of ultimate success? Because as it stands right now, we’ve got a set of teams that went all in on trying to get to second place. It feels more like they’re auditioning for a post-Warriors future than trying to succeed in the current landscape. Even in a world where success is narrowly defined by wins and losses, perception is everything. And some things are inherent: If the rest of the NBA can’t compete against the Warriors, they still can’t help but compete against themselves.The aftermath of the most emboldened trade request in recent NBA history has been ugly. Anthony Davis is not a Laker — or a Knick or a Celtic or a Buck for that matter. And the New Orleans Pelicans don’t seem to have much use for him either. They’d rather sit him and pile up losses, focus on the lottery race and protect Davis’ health so they can trade him in the offseason. But the NBA issued a directive: The Pelicans would be fined $100,000 for every game he sat.So it is that after playing well enough to keep the Pelicans in it, Davis was benched in the fourth quarter two games in a row. Then, against the Orlando Magic, they got blown out by 30 points, which led to Davis — chef’s kiss — criticizing the team’s effort. So things aren’t good. What’s worse: It doesn’t seem like they’re going to get any better.Thanks to the NBA’s orders, this is the only reasonable compromise for both the Pelicans and Davis. He gets to pervert his livelihood — surely important to a man who has spent so many days involuntarily sidelined by injuries — while the Pelicans at least get to lose some of the time.Here’s what it comes down to: The NBA can’t make a decision that weighs the Pelicans real interests, because it can’t be so blithely rational about what’s best for them, which is tanking. In an alternate universe with no draft lottery, the Pelicans might at least be incentivized to let Davis play when it matters to get fans in seats. But the league won’t acknowledge its worst kept secret, so a dysfunctional situation is primed to only get worse.Nothing like the 76ers to get the Boston Celtics going. And nothing like a loss to the Celtics on Tuesday night to spread anxiety in the lives of 76ers fans.Despite the addition of Tobias Harris, the 76ers lost to the Kyrie-less Celtics in the same ways they’ve habitually lost to them: The Celtics stuck like glue to the few shooters the 76ers play at the same time and treated Ben Simmons like a non-entity, while Al Horford ate Joel Embiid’s lunch. The Sixers couldn’t protect the perimeter on the other end, so they never got much of a chance to get out in transition.I won’t write them off as quickly as I did after Christmas, if only because Harris is the type of sharpshooter who could tip the scales in favor of an old-school style — if they’re willing to embrace it.Since trading for Jimmy Butler in November, the Sixers are seventh in pace, 11th in defense and 16th in offensive rebounding. This is a team with three starters who are above 6-foot-8, including the league’s most imposing center since Shaq, but it’s stuck in the middle because it’s trying to fit old-school parts into a new-school game. The league has been crashing full-tilt into more space and pace for years, so you can forgive the Sixers for trying, but you don’t win championships by playing against your strengths.Philadelphia should be slow, plodding, muscly and mean. It should crash the glass with impunity, hunt cross-matches with pick-and-rolls and bully defenders in the post. The mere idea of entering the paint against the 76ers should make opponents cower with fear.The only rub is that slowing it down doesn’t serve Ben Simmons’ style, but they’re going to have to figure out the inevitable tension between his transition-happy game and Embiid’s half-court dominance eventually. Better to do it while playing to your strengths and find out if it works now, instead of two years down the road.Following Jeremy Lin’s first game as a Raptor, he took to the podium and shared some interesting thoughts on the presence of the international media. Here are some snippets, from the Toronto Star:“Yeah, [Mandarin media] probably happens in every city that has a strong Asian contingent,” Lin said. “Happened in Atlanta as well, but not this. So again, I’m very proud to represent Asian people on a global platform, on a global scale. And for me to be here where there’s a lot of Asians, like, I used to run from it, you know?“Because that’s all anybody’s ever wanted to look for. Like, ‘Oh, he’s Asian, he’s Asian, he’s Asian.’ And I was like, talk about my basketball. But now people can see I can play, I belong in the NBA, and I’ve really embraced just being able to represent Asians and do it the right way, hopefully.“Yeah, I mean, I think I was really jaded after the New York stretch,” Lin continued. “I think there was a lot of things that happened that made me give up a little bit on people, per se. And that was a huge part of the story, and that was a huge point of contention for a lot of people as to why I was getting the publicity, or why things were the way they were.“So I kind of wanted to run from that a little bit. I would probably say three years down the road, I kind of turned a corner, and I would say being hurt for two straight years, and seeing that my Asian fan base, I don’t feel like it dropped off one bit. And I haven’t even touched the court. Like, every year I go over to Asia and I can’t even walk through the airport — it’s insane. So to see them do that after all the highs and lows, but really going through the lows post-Linsanity, which culminated in those injuries, for me, I’m still blown away. And again, that’s fed into why I want to carry myself a certain way.”I don’t have a lot to say here, except that it’s touching to see a man whose identity was leveraged and controlled by outside forces for so long get to stop running away from how he’s perceived and finally be himself: an NBA player who once turned the basketball universe on its head, an Asian-American, a God-fearing Harvard grad. He has lived long enough in the public eye that the public has finally accepted what they originally thought were contradictory traits. That, friends, is how stereotypes are broken.More from Yahoo Sports:• PGA Tour pro defends paying caddie $5K on $1.3M win • NFL bars NCAA’s all-time sack leader from combine • Only one NBA team failed to scout Antetokounmpo • Black History honor for Kaepernick sacked by lawmakers Isaiah Thomas gets standing ovation, drills 3-pointer in Nuggets debut originally appeared on nbcsportsboston.comBrad Stevens could have begun his All-Star vacation Wednesday night after the Boston Celtics defeated the Detroit Pistons.But Stevens had a Denver Nuggets game to catch.The Celtics head coach set his DVR for Nuggets-Sacramento Kings to watch his former star player, Isaiah Thomas, make his Denver debut after a lengthy absence caused by offseason hip surgery.Thomas didn't disappoint.

In any case, you have to admit the NBA never fails to entertain.More from Yahoo Sports: • Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight When spring training camps opened this week around Major League Baseball, it brought hope that maybe, finally, Bryce Harper and Manny Machado would sign with teams and baseball’s long free-agent freeze would melt away.Nope. Not yet. Not only has that not happened, something else did happen: a number of talented young players around the league have agreed to team-friendly contract extensions.The latest was New York Yankees ace Luis Severino, who on Friday reportedly agreed to a four-year, $40 million deal. The deal, first reported by Joel Sherman of the New York Post, would buy up Severino’s arbitration years and comes with a $15 million club option for his first year of free agency.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]By agreeing to this deal, the Yankees and Severino avoid arbitration for 2019. He’ll make $4 million this season, $10 million next, then $10.25 million in 2021 and $11 million in 2022. The club option is for 2023. In the grand scheme of society, this is a very generous contract. In baseball’s economic bubble, it’s another young player signing for below-market value relative to his skills and potential.It’s hard to blame Severino for taking the deal, looking around at a free-agent world where Harper and Machado are still available, as are Dallas Keuchel and Craig Kimbrel. Especially since we haven’t heard even slight grumblings about teams being interested in Keuchel and Kimbrel.Coming off a breakout season in which he went 19-8 with a 3.39 ERA, the 25-year-old Severino was given a deal that’s pretty hard to turn down: “Do you want $40 million guaranteed, yes or no?”The other players faced with a similar question this week were Philadelphia Phillies ace Aaron Nola, who said yes to a four-year, $45 million deal Wednesday. It also avoided arbitration and bought out two of Nola’s free agency years, making it the most below-market deal of any of these.The Minnesota Twins locked up two of their talented young players Thursday, as right fielder Max Kepler agreed to a five-year, $35 million deal with a $10 million club option for 2024. It buys out three years of free agency for Kepler, 26. Shortstop Jorge Polanco also agreed to a five-year extension, his is worth $25.75 million with two option years that could keep him in Minnesota through 2025.In a vacuum, these types of extensions look like win-wins: The players get guaranteed money as they’re coming off good seasons. The clubs get cost-certainty to help them navigate the future — whether it’s the Yankees and Phillies trying to add big free agents this year or next, or a team like the Twins striving for contention with a homegrown core.In a bigger sense, though, it’s hard not to look at these deals in the current state of free agency and wonder if they’re a symptom of something else. Is it the market correcting itself? Is it baseball’s economy morphing into something new? Or maybe it’s just players looking around and saying, “Well, I better get my money now.”According to numerous reports, there’s a fear that for this generation of young players the light at the end of the tunnel — the big free-agency payday — won’t be there for them in the same way it was for so many other players.So while it’s great that stars like Justin Verlander, Clayton Kershaw and Max Scherzer are publicly speaking out about the current state of free agency, they’re on the right side of it. They got their mega deals.The younger players find themselves in a different sort of peril. It’s entirely possible that these are the biggest paydays these players ever get, which is a much different economic model that we’ve seen from baseball in the past.Whether it’s right or wrong — and that’s certainly something that’s up for debate heading into the next collective-bargaining agreement — baseball’s economy has often been backward. Players get paid less, relative to the market, in their pre-free agency years. The best recent example is Mike Trout winning the MVP in 2014 at age 22 while making $1 million.He got a raise to $6 million the next season, but in 2015 was still making a fraction of what people like Ryan Howard ($25M), Albert Pujols ($24M), Joe Mauer ($23M), Mark Teixeira ($22.5M) and Jose Reyes ($22M) were making.But that overpay is a necessary part baseball’s economic ecosystem too. It’s a fact: Players get overpaid as their careers decline. It’s almost like baseball’s way of making up for underpaying players during their early years. It’s baseball’s golden parachute. What’s happening these days is fewer teams are accepting that overpay as part of the how the system works.In the past few years, arbitration salaries have gotten higher and higher, and teams have tried harder to lock up younger stars before free agency. It’s why we’ve see players like Madison Bumgarner, Chris Archer, Chris Sale and Paul Goldschmidt become valuable trade chips for their team-friendly contract extensions.Teams are getting smarter about where their money goes, and how to keep value in their assets. These extensions to Severino, Nola and the rest show that they’re willing to spend money, just in the way that they want.Earlier this week, former Miami Marlins president David Samson tweeted something in response to Justin Verlander, saying the “broken system” talk was wrong. Players and their agents, Samson said, needed to adjust to a “new reality.”He may be right about the new reality part. The monster paydays at the end of the free agency tunnel could be fading away. If Bryce Harper and Manny Machado can’t get them, who can?The new reality could be players seizing their money. Whenever they can.– – – – – –Mike Oz is a writer at Yahoo Sports.

However, Wainwright framed the situation with a little more urgency on Friday by expressing concerns that a day of reckoning could happen sooner than later.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]Speaking to InsideSTL.com’s Tim McKernan, Wainwright said it was inevitable that the players will go on strike unless major changes are made to help bridge the widening gap. But he’s also worried that frustrations could reach a boiling point during the season leading to some form of a revolt. Perhaps even a mid-season walkout.#STLCards pitcher Adam Wainwright on @TMASTL: “Unless something changes, there’s going to be a strike. 100%. I’m just worried people are going to walk-out mid-season.” pic.twitter.com/M8WeRVcASe— Tim McKernan (@tmckernan) February 15, 2019“Unless something changes, there’s going to be a strike. 100%,” Wainwright said regarding the free-agent freeze that has left stars like Bryce Harper and Manny Machado without contracts. “I’m just worried people are going to walkout midseason.”It’s conceivable given the current climate, but a players revolt on that level still feels like a long shot. The target date we should all still be looking at is Dec. 1, 2021. That’s when the current collective bargaining agreement ends and the owners will be forced to come to the table.That doesn’t mean we should just dismiss Wainwright’s concerns about a 2019 strike. While they might feel a little on the dramatic side, the frustration that has built all offseason as dozens of free agents, including and especially Harper and Machado, remain unsigned is becoming more palpable by the day. There’s a genuine feeling that owners are determined to cut back on salaries even as profits continue to reach new heights, it’s possible the players’ patience will run out if the free-agent freeze continues to drag on. Wainwright thinks so, and he’s far from alone.In Friday’s interview, the 37-year-old right-hander also criticized owners and front offense personnel for placing too much emphasis on “analytics” and placing everything in a “sabermetric box” that discounts intangibles and other immeasurable aspects of baseball.Adam Wainwright said today on ⁦@TMASTL⁩ that he expects there to be a strike “100%.”The context of the conversation comes from a discussion on how Bryce Harper and Manny Machado are still without teams.You can see Wainwright’s reasoning in the video below. pic.twitter.com/GXsmx4cXk1— Tim McKernan (@tmckernan) February 15, 2019Wainwright admitted that there’s always risk in making long-term financial commitments to players, but emphasized that doing so marks a commitment to winning that several teams seemingly lack.“Part of it is smart from their side of it, but you have to realize it’s about winning. So, if Bryce Harper wants 10 years and he’s 26 years old. He’s going to be a dynamic player. The same can be said about Manny Machado. These guys are superstar players.”The deeper we get into it the more obvious it is that the players know what battles lie ahead. The only real question is how much worse it will get before any progress is made toward a satisfactory resolution.More from Yahoo Sports:• Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight MLB rumors: Bryce Harper has made his decision, says D.C. radio host originally appeared on nbcsportsbayarea.comA report has come out from the East Coast saying Bryce Harper has come to a decision on which team he will play for in 2019 and beyond.Chris Russell, a sports radio talk show host from 106.7 The Fan in Washington D.C., (who has been on the Harper beat for some time) said the free agent slugger could make a decision in the next 24 hours.\"Maybe I took a little bit of a leap of faith here based on some indications I got from a real good source,\" Russell told 94WIP, in Philadelphia, on Friday.\"Bryce and his representatives, (Scott) Boras, his people, his wife Kayla, they've been meeting since Monday morning in Vegas. Bryce originally wanted this done, when it took this long, by Valentine's Day. Obviously, the contract has not been announced, signed, or whatever.\"\"But I'm led to believe by the people that I've talked to that are close to the situation -- and I have, again, a real good source that has helped me through this process, let's just leave it at that,\" Russell said. \"That Bryce was in a mood to celebrate yesterday. Now, the source said, 'I believe it's done.' I don't have concrete, 100 percent proof for you guys. I wish I did, otherwise, I would have it and I would be running around with it. But I don't have that, so I want to caution everybody in Philadelphia. But that's what I was led to believe, that this thing is now decided.\"Russell then mentioned the Phillies.\"Now, what comes then is hammering out a contract. And if we were to believe the report that the Philadelphia Phillies had not even extended a formal offer -- and I assume that to be a termed, written agreement, that type of thing, which I find hard to believe -- then there might be more legwork to this. And therefore, hey the decision may be done, but the contract still needs to be ironed out.\"[RELATED: Phillies fan participates in \"lent\" in hopes of recruiting Harper]Russell is being safe with the terminology he's using, which is understandable. And while we haven't been able to confirm these rumors, Harper, along with many other free agents, remains unsigned.The Giants appeared to be the \"mystery team\" that introduced themselves late into the Harper sweepstakes -- and when the radio hosts asked Russell his opinion on where the outfielder will end up next season, he believed Harper will be in an orange and black uniform.\"I don't think it's going to be the Nationals,\" Russell said. \"I think it's going to be the San Francisco Giants, but that is not by any means an 'I know that for a fact,' so I want to caution everybody -- I know how this works -- I get in trouble with everything I say on my radio show, and everyone blows it up.\" The wait continues ... Golden State Warriors stars Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant empathised with Steve Kerr after the head coach was ejected during the loss to the Portland Trail Blazers having thrown a clipboard in response to a flagrant foul call.Kerr was enraged late in the fourth quarter when Draymond Green was called for a flagrant foul after he stopped Zach Collins from approaching the rim as he went up for a shot.That drew Kerr's ire and after ranting in one referee's face, he slammed a clipboard down to earn an ejection, with Durant having to escort his head coach back off the court.The Warriors lost the game 129-107 but will still head into the All-Star break with the best record in the Western Conference.\"It was an emotional game. We fought really hard for 43 minutes,\" Curry told reporters afterwards.\"One questionable decision - the flagrant - obviously the fire came out. You see coach go and throw a clipboard. At that point you try to get us over the hump. An eight-point swing, it's tough to overcome.\"\"I looked at the replay and the amount of ball [Green] got, there was nothing excessive about it, he got all the ball.\"There was a lot of chirping, with Zach involved. There was probably a sensitivity to it, trying to put out some fires, but I thought it was a terrible call. We obviously paid the price for it with how everything unfolded after that.\"Durant shared that sympathy having been the one to pull Kerr away from the referees as he continued to rant at them.\"I felt for him, I understand his anger and his rage, especially for that call,\" he said.\"I thought we should have just kept playing, It was a common foul, I thought. Refs looked at it differently. \"I understand why coach was a little frustrated.\"Kerr explained that it was the disbelief at the call that had triggered his reaction.\"I was just shocked that that was called a flagrant foul,\" he said. \"I'm not sure how it's determined - if it's in New York or the officials on the call - but that was head-scratching: that that could be called a flagrant foul.\"The guy's going to go in for a dunk, you've got to make sure he doesn't dunk it.\"So, I told Kenny [Mauer] that I beg to differ. There might have been a couple of other words in there too!\"I'll have to ask the owner if the clipboard broke when I threw it down. I got a little anger out so that was good. I was too busy yelling to ask for an explanation.\"Charles Barkley thinks New Orleans Pelicans star Anthony Davis made a mistake with his trade request.The 25-year-old asked the Pelicans to move him in late January and the Los Angeles Lakers had been engaged in discussions about acquiring him. But, no deal was reached before the deadline and Davis remained with New Orleans.Barkley, an 11-time All-Star who works as an analyst for TNT, said he thinks Davis and his agent, Rich Paul, mishandled the situation.\"Don't ruin your reputation as a great player, one of the nicest guys in the world,\" Barkley told reporters on Thursday ahead of All-Star weekend (via the Washington Post).\"Remember, your agent works for you, you don't work for him. They handled that situation wrong. It's going to come back to bite them in the a***. It's unfortunate.\"The six-time All-Star entered play on Thursday averaging 28.5 points and 13.1 rebounds this season. But, he scored just three points in 24 minutes on the floor in the Pelicans' 118-88 loss to the Orlando Magic earlier this week.\"This is a bad situation,\" Barkley said. \"It's a bad look for the NBA. Because that kid can't go out there and give 100 per cent because he’s worried about getting hurt. The guy's the second-best player in the world and he's got three points? That's not a good look for the NBA.\"The Boston Celtics and New York Knicks, among others, are expected to explore dealing for Davis after the season. Barkley, however, said he believes the forward will eventually land in Los Angeles because of Paul's relationship with Lakers star LeBron James.Barkley tallied 22.1 points and 11.7 rebounds per game over his 16-year career. He retired in 2000 and was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame six years later.After an apology from Sergio Garcia, a non-apology from Matt Kuchar, and an uncooperative Mother Nature on Valentine's Day, it's time for everyone to focus again on Tiger Woods. Kidding. Sort of. A weather-delayed first round at Riviera re-starts on Friday morning and the 14-time major champ will be in the Hollywood-area spotlight as he finally begins his Genesis Open. And golf fans could potentially see a LOT of the tournament host as the event tries to play catch up after heavy rains on Thursday.Woods, Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas (Decent group, eh?) are scheduled to tee off at 8:32 local time (11:32 ET). The hope is they will complete their first rounds and then play as much of their second rounds as possible before darkness. And Tiger's hope is to finally win for the first time at this historic layout where he missed the cut last year. We'll be tracking Tiger every step of the way so keep it right here for the latest scores, news and highlights. (All times eastern)SATURDAY, 11:25: With a 25-foot birdie putt on No. 9, Woods' final hole of the second round, Tiger will likely make the cut. The birdie brought Woods back to even on his round and to one under overall.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096808527694245890After resuming play in the morning, Woods bogeyed his first hole, No. 4, then made four pars before his finishing birdie. His playing partners, however, fared much better. Justin Thomas shares the lead with Adam Scott at 11 under and Rory McIlroy birdied four of his six holes on Saturday morning to shoot 63 and move to seven under through 36 holes. Thursday's early wave is now on the course for their second rounds.-------------------FRIDAY-------------------8:25: And with that, the horn has sounded—play will be suspended for darkness on Friday at Riviera. Tiger, JT and Rory have six more holes to complete their second round. Justin Thomas is at 10-under, tied with Adam Scott for the lead. Tiger will hope Saturday brings some different momentum for him—as this marathon day ends with two bogeys in a row after the highlight eagle.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10965708926692065298:21: That's back-to-back bogeys now for Tiger Woods, dropping another shot here at the third hole (his 12th of the round). And over his past six holes, Tiger has four bogeys. The birdie at No. 1 helped negate most of that damage ... but Tiger's back to 1-under again—right on the current cut line.8:13: On his 30th hole of the day, Tiger is showing some obvious signs of being tired. And who could blame him—he's been playing golf for nearly 10 hours straight. From 165 yards out at the third hole, Tiger Woods tries to chop out a 6-iron and comes out of it. His ball comes to rest short of the green. With sunset in Pacific Palisades being 5:30 local time, this group will have time for maybe one more hole today.8:04: Tiger follows up that eagle putt at No. 1 with a bogey at the second hole. The third bogey of his second round moves Tiger back to 2-under overall.7:56: After a long wait at the second hole, Tiger sprays his second shot from 235 out with a fairway wood out to the right. He'll have his work cut out from the front right bunker to save par at the 482-yard par 4.7:40: This is exactly what Tiger Woods needed: He rolls in his 43-foot eagle putt at his 10th hole (the first) to get back to 3-under—negating those two bogeys he made on his front nine. What a putt! With the flagstick in!https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096570892669206529Tiger made a disappointing par to open his first round earlier today at the first hole. The unlikely eagle makes up for that effort—and could turn around Tiger's second round in a dramatic way. Tiger goes from toeing the cut line at 1-under to now all of a sudden being T-21.7:28: Tiger finds the fairway at the par-5 first hole, the group's 10th hole of their second round, as he attempts to get a shot back here after bogeying two of his final three holes on his front nine. Neither bogey was particularly bad—the 18th hole is playing brutally tough right now uphill and into the wind with the rain, making it even more of a challenging hole. And his break at 16 was very unlucky.7:16: Tiger and JT are gonna have their work cut out to save par at the 18th hole (their ninth). Each player had fairway wood approaches and tried playing a big cut. JT was way up left on the hill—Tiger was closer. He went high with his approach and will have about 11 feet left for par.Tiger misses the par putt, so he'll drop a shot along with JT as they make the turn. Tiger moves back to 1-under after 27 holes. That's where the cut line currently is—so all of a sudden, Tiger must be concerned about making the cut.7:01: Following Justin Thomas throwing a dart at the 17th to about 3 feet, Tiger puts his wedge shot from under 100 yards to outside 20 feet, so he'll be disappointed with that effort. The birdie putt misses on the high side, and Tiger taps in for par to remain at 2-under. His playing partner and buddy Justin Thomas stays hot, rolling in a fourth straight birdie to get to 9-under—tied for the lead with Adam Scott. Really impressive golf here from JT.6:54: The rain is really coming down now as the players head to the 17th hole. Tiger finds the fairway at the par-5 17th hole, but it was a short one—he has 326 yards left. Most players have been laying up at this par 5 all day.6:43: From a brutal position up against the back lip of the bunker, Tiger hacks it out—and somehow keeps the ball on the green, albeit the back portion. His par attempt from 44 feet away here comes up three feet shy. Tiger makes his bogey to move back to 2-under.Meanwhile, Justin Thomas is officially on fire. He has another birdie after a fabulous tee shot at 16. It's now two Kentucky boys tied at the top: Justin Thomas and J.B. Holmes (-8).https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10965576791939317766:39: Tiger will have serious lie issues at the par-3 16th hole. His tee shot came to rest up against the back lip of the bunker. As Billy Kratzert just remarked on PGA Tour Live, Tiger will do well just to keep this ball on the green. Though he avoided dropping a shot on his last hole, there might be a bogey in his future here.6:35: A clutchhh par save by Tiger at the 15th hole makes up for his poor chip—and Tiger keeps the momentum going on his second round, as he stays 3-under for the tournament and 2-under on the round.Justin Thomas, also in Tiger's group, holed out from in front of the green for birdie at the 14th hole, and he makes a long birdie putt at 15 to get to 7-under—just one back of fellow Kentucky native J.B. Holmes.6:32: A poor chip shot from Tiger at the 15th hole leaves him about 13 feet away. He'll need to convert that putt to prevent dropping his first shot of his second round.6:24: Tiger finds another fairway here at Riviera, this one at the 15th hole. The guy is feeeling it with his driver. Almost on auto pilot. His approach from 190 out turns a little too much, finding the rough to the left of the green. He'll have to get up and down to avoid dropping one here.6:20: From 20 feet out, Tiger's birdie bid comes up shy—never really scaring the hole, despite getting a good look at the line from Rory's putt. Tiger taps in for par to remain at 3-under.The putter has been disappointing for Tiger all day: He had 34 putts in his first round, including four three-putts, just the third time in his career he's done that.6:13: Tiger puts his tee shot at the par-3 14th hole just inside Rory's ball—about 20 feet right of the hole. He'll get a little teach from Rory's putt, too, as Tiger continues to hit it well today.6:07: Tiger just misses the left-to-right curling bid for birdie, leaving himself with an easy par at 13. He stays 3-under for the tournament and -2 through four on his round.Tiger's playing partners are also playing well—Rory has three birdies in his first four holes to get to 2-under. Look out for Rory at rainy Riviera. And Justin Thomas, despite hitting his tee shot out of bounds at 13, got up and down from 160 yards to avoid dropping multiple shots. He's now 5-under after that bogey.6:02: Another grooved tee shot for Tiger Woods at the 13th hole puts him in good position. He turned over his tee shot—putting his draw in the middle of the fairway at the dogleg left. Tiger spins his approach back to about 15 feet, just off the green in the fringe. He'll have a chance to knock another one here and keep the momentum going.5:51: Bang! Tiger nails the 25-footer for birdie at the 12th hole to add a second birdie to his card through three holes. Realistically, too, it could be three straight birdies for Tiger. But the 14-time major champion is now 2-under through 3—T-3 for the tournament (T-19)—and carries some strong momentum on his side at the start of his second round ... as the rain is coming down at Riviera.5:46: Tiger hits his approach hole high—about 25 feet from 181 yards. He'll have another chance to add a birdie to his third round.Tiger's currently at 2-under, which puts him at T-29. The projected cut is at 1-under—so he's comfortably inside the number as of now. But there's a ton of golf to be played, obviously.5:41: Tiger finds the fairway with his driver at the par-4 12th hole. The 12th usually plays as one of the toughest holes at Riviera—we'll see if Tiger can take advantage of his position here in the fairway.5:33: An excellent fairway-wood second shot by Tiger put him right in front of the par-5 11th green in two. But a very poor approach putt for his third leaves him more than 10 feet away. His birdie try slides by for a very disappointing par being so close in 2. That should've been a golden opportunity to start his second round with two birdies—instead, Tiger stays at 2-under.5:12: Tiger goes high with his pitch—having to navigate around the front bunker, and plays it nicely—spinning it about 7 feet short of the hole. So Tiger will have a good look for an opening birdie to start his second round. Tiger converts the birdie putt to move to 2-under.5:02: Only a little more than a half hour after finishing his first round, Tiger Woods (-1) -- along with Justin Thomas (-5) and Rory McIlroy (+1) -- has teed off in his second round. The group started on the drivable 10th hole, and Tiger has driven his tee shot just off the green. He'll have a chance to put his pitch shot close to start his second round with a birdie.4:24: Tiger narrowly misses the birdie putt at the 18th hole, so he'll tap in for a par and an opening-round, one-under 70 at Riviera. Having three-putted for a fourth time on the 17th hole to drop a shot in disappointing fashion, Tiger will head to his second round a bit frustrated. But the four consecutive birdies showed him being able to score well at Riviera, where he has never won.Tiger, JT (who birdied 18 to finish at 5-under) and Rory will head right back for their second round in this marathon day for them.4:18: Tiger responds to that shocking three-putt with a perfect drive and a towering 6-iron on Riviera's famed 18th. Woods is in good shape to at least make par the difficult hole, but as we've seen all day, a two-putt is anything but automatic.Here's an unusual stat on Tiger three-putting four times this afternoon. He's making some history in a bad way...https://twitter.com/JustinRayGolf/status/10965196250582507574:06: So much for the momentum. . . After a decent approach shot that spins back to about 20 feet, Woods runs his birdie putt a couple feet by and. . . gulp. . . misses the comebacker from about two feet. Wow. That's four three-putts on the day as Tiger falls back to one under with one hole to play.3:57: Uh-oh, it's raining in southern California again. Meanwhile, Woods is plodding his way up the par-5 17th. After pulling his drive into the left rough and drawing a poor lie, Woods pushed his layup slightly into the first cut of the right rough. He'll have a some sort of wedge to a back-right hole location.3:50: Tiger's tee shot was tracking on the par-3 16th, but it comes up about 30 feet short. From there, he two-putts for par to remain at two under. Justin Thomas makes his 10-foot birdie effort to move to four under, while Rory McIlroy remains at one over. McIlroy hast two holes to avert his first over-par score of 2019.3:40: After another great drive and a solid approach, Woods races his birdie attempt nearly five feet past the hole. But he keeps the overall positive momentum going by converting the par putt to remain at two under. Tiger has three more holes to play. At least, before he gets a lunch break.3:24: BANG! There's the bounce back from Tiger. It just came one hole later. And from farther away as Woods drains his 12-footer for birdie on No. 14.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096507996031467520Woods is now back to two under, five shots behind Jordan Spieth, who has to be pleased to still be in front by two despite these soft conditions.3:17: Tiger hits a great shot on the difficult par-3 14th hole to about 15 feet. He'll have a good look at birdie coming up. In the meantime, here's a look at how the leader board stands with Jordan Spieth still leading the way.Jordan Spieth (-7) 2t. Tony Finau (-5) 2t. Patrick Rodgers (-5) 2t. Kramer Hickok (-5) 2t. Davis Love III (-5) 2t. Adam Scott (-5) 2t. J.B. Homes (-5)Click here for full scores.3:13: Woods stuck his approach to about four feet below the hole on No. 13. A bounce back birdie looked like a forgone conclusion until he pushed his effort. Woof. That's two three-putts and two short misses on the greens for Tiger today. He remains at one under. Meanwhile, Rory McIlroy, after getting to two under through eight, has fallen to one over after back-to-back bogeys. Justin Thomas, the third player in the group, continues to lead this trio at three under.3:05: After hitting fade after fade, Woods steps to the 13th tee and rips a draw around the corner, perfectly setting up his next shot. Good to see him working it both ways with ease.3:01: Tiger pushed his tee shot into the right rough, then hit a fantastic recovery shot from a thick lie onto the green. He had a long look at birdie that rolled about four feet past, leaving him with a tricky left-to-right par putt, which he missed. That's three three putts on the day for Woods, and he's still one under.2:39: Not the best chip from Woods, as he left himself about six feet for birdie, but he makes it anyway. Four straight for Tiger to get to two under for the day.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10964952191957975042:30: Woods rips a 3-wood from 269 to just in front of the green. Hate to jinx him, but there's no reason he shouldn't easily make his fourth straight birdie here (ducks).2:20: Three in a row for Woods as he rolls in another at No. 10 and moves to one under. If he finds the fairway again at the 11th, four in a row will be in his sights. Meanwhile, Rory makes his par to stay at one under and JT ends up holing his 10 footer for birdie to get to four under. Finally a little bit of JUICE from this threesome.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096489287753711616https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096489787672780800By the way, it looks like we know when they'll be heading back out for round two later today. Here's an update from the Tiger Tracker:https://twitter.com/GCTigerTracker/status/1096481806067523585That should give them enough time to get at least 11 or 12 holes in.At the 11th, Woods stripes another drive down the fairway. He's really starting to cook.2:12: Tiger's shot was a tad more difficult than we thought, as he had to avoid a bunker and take it up high to get it back to the pin. He was successful, sticking it to about three feet. Hell of a shot. Even better was Rory's shot, as he flopped it from a nice lie and got it to hang on just off the back of the green and stay out of the back bunker. Thomas, who had the easiest shot, put too much spin on his chip, leaving himself with about 10 feet for birdie.2:07: Finally, Tiger, Rory and JT hit their tee shots, and it looks like the ensuing entertainment will be well worth the wait. Tiger is in the collection area left of the green, where he has a straightforward chip that should set him up with a good chance to make birdie. Thomas is just in front of the green, and he'll have a great chance to make a birdie as well. Rory ... um ... not so much. He's in the rough with a greenside bunker in front of him and a pin he won't be able to get close to, and just holding the green would be a miracle.1:52: Woods drains his four-footer for bird and turns in even par 35. Real strong finish to his opening nine, and now it looks like he'll have a long wait at the 10th. DeChambeau, Kuchar and Rahm have still yet to hit their tee shots.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10964831254067896321:47: Tiger had just 122 left to the green and stuck one in there close. He has four feet left for birdie to turn in even par, which would be a small victory after that ugly three putt back at No. 7. Not to mention he'll have a prime opportunity to get into red figures at the driveable par-4 10th.1:41: Woods cranks another high fade right down the middle with the driver at No. 9. With the tees up today, he'll have a low iron in his hand for his approach.1:34: And he's on the board! Woods bounces back with a birdie putt from 15 feet, getting him back to one over. We'll see if that gets him going before making the turn.1:30: From 125 yards out, Woods hit a wedge and hated it from the second he made contact. While he did pull it, he's still hole high and inside 20 feet. Hideki Matsuyama-esque move from Tiger.1:24: Woods rips one right down the middle at the par-4 eighth. Should have a short iron in.1:15: Tiger's birdie putt was actually from just off the green on the fringe, and he rolled it by some four feet. Then, he missed the comebacker for par, dropping to two over on the day. Oof.1:09: Fairway and a green for Woods at the seventh. Good look at birdie coming up to get back to level par.12:58: Another hole, another par for Woods, who two-putted from 24 feet on the par-3 sixth. In the group up ahead, though, Jon Rahm is making a move at three under through six.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/109646557828021452912:47: Another meh hole for Tiger on No. 5, just missing the fairway with his tee shot, finding the front of the green with a so-so approach, and two-putting for another par from 43 feet. Woods remains at one over through five holes while his playing partners, McIlroy and Thomas, both remain at one under.12:42: As Matt Kuchar's ball is in the air on the par-3 sixth, a fan yells, \"Go low—just not with the gratuity!\" Despite Matt maintaining this is \"not a story,\" it is. And this won't be the last comment like this.12:29: Woods hit a nice shot to about 15 feet on the par-3 fourth, but ran his birdie effort by the hole. Still one over. Still no highlights. At least, from Tiger. Here was Spieth's closing birdie from about an hour ago, because there is not much else exciting going on right now.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/109644546143346688112:17: Another missed fairway and another short approach from Tiger on the par-4 third. Although, Woods found the putting surface, he was unable to two-putt from 63 feet, missing a seven-footer for par after badly misreading his first putt. That drops Tiger to one over through three holes. Not a lot of highlights so far. . .12:02: Tiger misses right off the tee on No. 2 then comes up short on another approach. But his pitch shot nearly goes down, leaving him with a tap-in par. Even par through two holes.11:49: After that perfect opening tee shot, Tiger hit a hideous approach with a 5-iron that came up way short in a fairway bunker. From there, he hit his third to 10 feet but missed the putt to walk away with a disappointing par. Both of Tiger's playing partners, McIlroy and Thomas, make birdie.11:38: Matt Kuchar just misses his eagle attempt from 25 feet on No. 1, but taps in for birdie. Kuchar has been in the news a lot this week over a caddie controversy dating back to his win at the Mayakoba Golf Classic. A controversy he didn't help with his comments on Wednesday. Is it possible some of those \"Kuuuuch\" shouts will turn to \"Mooooch\"? Kinda sounded like it on the first hole. . .11:34: Jordan Spieth is in with a seven-under-par 64 to take the early lead. Spieth needed only 21 putts during his bogey-free round. Of course, starting tournaments hasn't been a problem for Spieth of late. Finishing, however, has been a different story. Incredibly, Spieth is looking for his first win since the 2017 British Open and his first top 5 since last year's Masters.11:32: Woods smashes a driver off the first tee that finds the fairway. The opening par 5 at Riviera is essentially a long par 4 and one of the easiest holes on the PGA Tour all year so Tiger is thinking at least birdie after that tee shot.10:53: So far, so good on the Friday weather:https://twitter.com/GCTigerTracker/status/1096437235262533632And with lift, clean and place in play (for at least the first round), low scores are out there. Let's set the over/under on the Par-71 layout at 68.5.10:45: We are approximately 45 minutes away from Tiger's tee time and it's another major champ who is already off to a fantastic start. Jordan Spieth has the lead at six under through 15 holes. Spieth leads Patrick Rodgers by one and then there's a big group at four under, including Bill Haas, who is playing in the event a year after being involved in a car accident during last year's tournament that killed a friend he was staying with. Make sure you read Brian Wacker's piece from earlier in the week on how Haas is still trying to move on from that tragedy.10:35: As we move within an hour from Tiger teeing off, check out GOLFTV's latest behind-the-scenes video with Woods in which he says his bag has up to 16(!) golf gloves during rainy rounds and he explains why he doesn't like wearing rain jackets:https://twitter.com/GOLFTV/status/1096246456795697153\"Pops used to say, 'Once you're wet, you're wet.

Once he started running the front office, his blinking at Paul George on national TV contributed to the Lakers getting fined again for tampering. Johnson’s praise of Giannis Antetokounmpo drew yet another tampering fine.So, though he escaped punishment for his recent comments on 76ers guard Ben Simmons, Johnson refused to answer a question about Hornets guard Kemba Walker.Carolina Blitz:Asked Magic about Kemba and he said y’all aren’t going to catch him slipping anymore. pic.twitter.com/sQZtIWnQbn— Carolina Blitz (@KeepBlitzin) February 15, 2019Johnson:You know I can’t answer any questions about no players, because every time I do it, I get fined. But anybody else do it, they don’t get fined. So I’m going to stay away from that one.I don’t blame Johnson for feeling that way.Other teams’ owners, coaches and executives have repeatedly publicly discussed rival players without facing announced punishment.To be fair, the NBA doesn’t reveal every fine. Bucks owner Marc Lasry reportedly just got fined for tampering, but the league never announced it. But, at minimum, there’s an inconsistency with how the NBA exposes Johnson’s transgressions.Even NBA commissioner Adam Silver said last year there’s a spotlight on the Lakers due to prior tampering. That strikes me as unfair. The Lakers already paid for their prior violations and should now be held to the same standard as everyone else.And for what it’s worth, I wish that standard allowed an all-time great point guard like Johnson to publicly share his thoughts on Kemba Walker.Gareth Bale has landed himself in hot water after La Liga denounced the Real Madrid star for his celebration in the Madrid derby, which could carry a ban of four to 12 games.The Welsh forward scored as a substitute in the 3-1 victory over Atletico Madrid, bringing up his 100th goal for the club.And during the celebrations that followed, Bale \"lifted his right arm near his head in a clear sign of provocation towards the fans, then giving a gesture which could be seen as obscene and disdainful by folding his arm and striking it with his other hand.\"In a statement released by La Liga, Bale’s punishment will be decided by whether he incited the crowd or not.If Bale is guilty of “inciting opposition fans” to cause a hostile reaction, the punishment could carry four to 12 games, if there was no hostile reaction but intent, then it could be as little as one to three games.The gesture is referred to in Spain as ‘corte de mangas,’ with the moment not picked up in the referee’s match report.A committee will now decide whether the gesture merits a punishment.Bale also featured in Real’s Champions League victory over Ajax.Los Blancos take a 2-1 lead back to the Bernabeu for the second leg of the last 16 tie after Marco Asensio’s late winner.Earlier this week Heisman Trophy winner — and first round draft pick of the Oakland Athletics — Kyler Murray chose football over baseball, committing himself to the NFL draft. It was a move that, however sensible from Murray’s point of view, has led to a lot of soul-searching among baseball folks and has raised questions about what the sport offers young, talented athletes with other options.It’s not that bleak, however! Another outstanding college football player said no to football this week and reaffirmed his commitment to baseball. Tim Tebow! From PFT:One Florida Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback will not be coaching another in the Alliance of American Football.Steve Spurrier, the Florida Heisman winner who later coached the Gators to a national championship and is now head coach of the AAF’s Orlando Apollos, said this morning on PFT Live that after the AAF briefly reached out to Tebow in the ball, it became clear that Tebow’s focus is on playing baseball.Ok, so maybe Tebow is not turning down quite the football opportunity that Murray would’ve been.

In the last month alone he's won his 44th PGA Tour event, finished second in another, hit every fairway in a round for the first time in 21 years, shot a 60, pulled off this impossible recovery shot, gone viral just by rolling his eyes and said he might drop the Players from his schedule because he's already won it (a literal mic drop). The man simply cannot be stopped right now.Leave it to the weather to literally rain on Lefty's parade. On Thursday at the Genesis Open, Mickelson began his first round at the difficult short par-4 10th and drove into one of the bunkers up near the green, leaving him with a dreaded lengthy sand shot. He wound up hitting it over the green, and his ball plugged in the back bunker, setting up an even harder shot than he just had. As you'll hear PGA Tour Live commentator Shane Bacon say, avoiding making a six was probably the goal, but after Mickelson hit his third into another bunker on the other side of the green, a six suddenly became best-case scenario. How does a four sound instead?https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096076528142626818Find us a more Phil Mickelson par ever... you can't. He's always got a flair for the dramatic. The problem?

(Old man golfers)The dust is barely settled in the wake of the end of the Markelle Fultz era in Philadelphia, and the former 76ers guard is already taking shots at his old team.His old coach Brett Brown in particular.Fultz had his introductory press conference with the Orlando Magic on Thursday after being traded at last week’s deadline and praised his new coach Steve Clifford while taking a veiled shot at Brown.“It just excites me to know that I have a coach that’s going to push you to be better and not just going to tell you what you want to hear,” Fultz said.That’s direct praise for his new coach. But the message for Brown is clear. Fultz didn’t like what he heard from the Philadelphia coaching staff.Fultz never had any public dispute with the 76ers, but it was evident that he and the team had different approaches to the struggles that saw him shoot 41.4 percent from the field, 26.7 percent from 3-point distance and 53.4 percent from the line in limited action after being selected as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2017 draft.It’s still not clear whether injury or a mental block – or both – are the cause of his shooting issues.After his agent announced that the nerve disorder thoracic outlet syndrome was the root of the shooting woes, Fultz never played again for the 76ers.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]Fultz appears to be fully embracing the fresh start in Orlando as a player and a person.“I think the biggest thing we talked about what doing thing the right way,” Fultz said. “Just building me up both as a man and on the court. I think that’s music to my ears, really just. Two things I really want to do is be the best player I can be and be the best young man I can be.”Fultz described the experience of his nerve disorder to reporters.“It’s hard to lift up your arms, you lose feeling in your fingers,” Fultz said. “You can’t tell when it’s going to happen. It’s not like you do the same motion every time. You get tingling in your fingers, numbness. Stuff like that.”He also curtly dismissed any notion that his shooting struggles are due to anything but injury.“I had an injury,” Fultz said. “I was out there trying to play through that. I never lost confidence.”Asked about a timetable to return, Fultz dodged the question to talk about rehab.“Right now it’s just about getting everything the right way,” he said. “Rehab’s been going great. I’m just taking my time and doing everything the right way.”More from Yahoo Sports: • PGA Tour pro defends paying caddie $5K on $1.3M win • NFL bars NCAA’s all-time sack leader from combine • Only one NBA team failed to scout Antetokounmpo • Black History honor for Kaepernick sacked by lawmakers He might not be well known to NFL fans at large, but New England Patriots fans know linebacker Kyle Van Noy — acquired basically for free from the Detroit Lions at the 2016 trade deadline — has been a big part of the defense the last two years, and has a knack for making plays at the right time.Van Noy is getting a little shine after winning his second Super Bowl ring with New England, appearing on the “Pardon My Take” podcast on Thursday to dish on all things Patriots and Super Bowl LIII.One thing that Van Noy revealed: the Los Angeles Rams didn’t do anything surprising during the game on offense.“I couldn’t believe that,” Van Noy said. “They really didn’t do — not one wrinkle. I was like, ‘What the hell?’ They’ve got so many good players, they’ve got so many things they’ve done all year, and the one play they gave us which was a wrinkle was the [Brandin] Cooks screen that hit for a little bit.“And that was it… Or maybe too, we were playing so good they were like, ‘[Expletive], we don’t know what to do.’ ”Hindsight, of course, is 20-20, but given that the Patriots’ coaching staff is known for having its players prepared for any and everything, it seems unwise that Los Angeles didn’t add some new plays or looks to try to stump New England.Van Noy said the Patriots’ culture, specifically coach Bill Belichick’s practice of not sparing anyone in the film room, even Tom Brady, is part of why the team continues to win.“Oh yeah. Yeah, that [stuff is] sick, to be honest, because it sets the table,” Van Noy said. “Like, OK, it doesn’t matter who you are, everyone’s on an even playing field. This is how it is here at work. You come in and you earn everything.“And I respect that because I felt like that gave me a chance to get on the field when I came in mid-year, and [Belichick] was like, ‘It doesn’t matter who you are or what you’ve done. You earn your keep.’ ”More from Yahoo Sports: • Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight The Brady Conundrum: How do you go about replacing the GOAT? originally appeared on nbcsportsboston.comThe Patriots hatched a Tom Brady succession plan after the 2013 season when they drafted Jimmy Garoppolo.Brady blew that up.Now, five years, four Super Bowl appearances, three Super Bowl wins, two Super Bowl MVPs and a regular-season MVP later, it's time to gingerly -- caaaauuuuuutiooooousssssllllyyyyy -- begin the process again.This time should be different.Even though Brady's contract hasn't been extended past the 2019 season, the love and happiness we saw on the field after the Rams were dispatched in SB53 is a good sign.MORE PATRIOTSAreas of Change: Will Pats be able to retain free agents Trey Flowers and Trent Brown?Brady's wariness about the Patriots' plans for him, and Bill Belichick's wariness about wedding his team to a quarterback who's closer to 50 years old than he is to 30, has dissipated.Once a new deal is in place -- Jonathan Kraft indicated that might be before training camp, though as of the Super Bowl conversations hadn't started -- Brady will have a written assurance that he will leave the Patriots and the NFL on his terms.That wasn't the case in early 2014 when the soon-to-be-37-year-old Brady saw the Patriots spend a first-round pick on a defensive tackle (Dominique Easley) and their second-rounder on Garoppolo. That, after a '13 season Brady spent throwing to the likes of Aaron Dobson, Josh Boyce, Kenbrell Thompkins and Austin Collie.Garoppolo was a stick of dynamite under Brady's behind. He was the existential threat Brady feared made flesh.Jimmy might have thought he was drafted to learn how to play quarterback in the NFL and have a nice career. To Brady, Garoppolo was there to take his job, throw his career into upheaval, uproot his family and see Brady cast out into the NFL wilderness.MORE PATRIOTSPerry: If Beckham is on the trade block, should Patriots be willing to pay the price?And, in contrast to the guy Brady succeeded in 2001 (and, by extension, did all those things to), Brady wasn't going to snort derisively at the plucky little draft pick here to take his job. He would crush the threat.He did.Brady played so well that -- despite Garoppolo developing into a bona-fide front-line quarterback under Belichick and Josh McDaniels (and Brady) -- Brady left the ever-prepared Patriots with no recourse when Garoppolo's contract was about to expire.Brady was too good to bench and too important to trade. Garoppolo was too expensive to franchise and too smart to take a \"bridge\" contract so he could watch Brady from the sidelines while his own hair started to gray at the temples. So off he went around Halloween, 2017.A lot's happened in the 16 months since.MORE PATRIOTSPhil Perry's Mock Draft 1.0: Pats start looking for Gronk's replacementBut now here we are, in the offseason of Brady's 42nd year. And the complex question of how to find the player who will eventually replace the greatest quarterback in NFL history still lingers.Do you draft his successor? If you do, do you do it this year? Do you do it next year?Do you try to get into the top 10 to get your pick of the litter? Do you stay put, confident that the muttonheads across the league will miss out as they did with Brady and Garoppolo (or Aaron Rodgers, Russell Wilson, Drew Brees, Brett Favre, Johnny Unitas . . . you get the point)? How much will it cost to get into the top 10? Do you package picks from this season -- when you will have six in the first three rounds -- and pick a sucker who will suck next year and fleece them for their 2020 first-rounder? How high do you have to go for a blue-chip, given the number of first-round quarterbacks that will be taken this year and that were taken in 2018?Is it a trade for somebody another team's given up on or has no work for, like San Francisco's Nick Mullens? A veteran who will hit free agency like Nick Foles, Case Keenum or Teddy Bridgewater?How does the successor play the position? Similar to Brady in that brain/eyes/accuracy/commitment trumps legs/arm strength/versatility?MORE PATRIOTSShould Pats be interested in Demaryius Thomas? No . . . and yesOr is there an embrace of the fact that trying to find a quarterback similar to a guy who came into the league after four years at Michigan at the end of last century with a once-in-a-lifetime work ethic is a pipe dream?Aside from who the successor is and how he plays, can Brady -- the lion in winter -- be tapped to help groom whoever is being brought aboard to take over?Brady -- contrary to sexed-up speculation -- didn't actively undermine Garoppolo at any point. They were teammates. He helped Garoppolo play the position better. They became close. But he wasn't quite showing him his world, either. Brady is famous for saying he's not giving away his secrets to younger quarterbacks until after he's done.With the end-date likely to be agreed upon when he signs an extension, does he become more a mentor so that the success of the franchise has a better chance to continue after he leaves? Would the Patriots want him to do that?Or would they want a blank(ish) slate to work with that isn't saying, \"But Tom said . . . \" when they try to shape him to succeed?And that contract? What's it look like? Does Brady demand pay commensurate with what he's accomplished? Is he in the mood to do the team another financial solid given the only bump they have him in 2018 was incentives he never reached? How does that impact the structure of the team?These questions aren't new. What is new is the level of angst and anxiousness. It's dissipated tremendously.That won't make finding his replacement or choosing the means by which the Patriots will do it any easier. But it's less fraught now.The irony is, the Patriots already successfully found Brady's successor. It's just that 2014 was too soon to go looking for him.Now, can they do it again?Click here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!

Before the team's loss to the Blazers on Wednesday night, he told ESPN that he \"wants to finish his career as a Warrior.\"      View this post on Instagram    Klay wants to stay in The Bay.A post shared by  espn (@espn) on Feb 13, 2019 at 9:23pm PSTThompson is set to be an unrestricted free agent at the end of the 2018-19 season.This isn't the first time Klay has made his feelings known. Even his father Mychal, who played five seasons for the Lakers, believes his son will re-sign with the Warriors. [RELATED: For Steve Kerr, Steph Curry and Klay Thompson are mix of NBA past and present]The Warriors selected Thompson with the No. 11 overall pick in the 2011 NBA Draft. Since then, he's been a five-time NBA All-Star, three-time Finals champion and two-time All-NBA selection. Anything could happen, but it's safe to say the Klay and the Dubs have quite the relationship and are ready to tie the knot.Jason Witten never worked with Kellen Moore as a coach, but he did practice with Moore when both of them were still active players with the Cowboys.That experience is enough for Witten to think Moore has “a way about him” that will pay off in his new job as the Cowboys offensive coordinator. Witten said this week that he believes Moore will be innovative and that the offense will take a “big step” by gearing things around quarterback Dak Prescott.“Yeah, I think he will do the things that Dak likes to do,” Witten said, via the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. “He will do the things they have to do to win. That is the way they have to play. I think they will use the pass to set up the run. Not just the run to set up the pass. I think he will add some nice wrinkles to that offense.”With head coach Jason Garrett coaching in the final year of his contract, Moore’s work with the offense will have a lot to do with how Dallas does in 2019 and with the path the team charts in the years that follow. If Witten’s correct, that path will probably look a lot like the one they’ve been on for a while.The story of Danny Ainge's Greece visit to watch Giannis Antetokounmpo is a wild one originally appeared on nbcsportsboston.comThe Boston Celtics took an early interest in Greece basketball star Giannis Antetokounmpo before he was selected in the 2013 NBA Draft.C's president of basketball operations Danny Ainge actually went over to Europe to watch Antetokounmpo play, and the postgame scene was nothing short of crazy.Fans were going wild, and some of them even yelled at Ainge because they thought he was associated with Antetokounmpo's team -- Ainge was sitting near its bench during the game.Check out the video below to hear the wild story of Ainge's scouting visit to Greece:Time for another \"Finding Giannis\" outtake. The first NBA team to scout Giannis was the Boston Celtics. As is often the case in Greece, hilarity ensued, as told by @GrgpanouOCT about Danny Ainge's visit. #FindingGiannis will be broadcasted Saturday on TNT at 630pm EST. pic.twitter.com/8bLjIjHv77— Jonathan Givony (@DraftExpress) February 14, 2019The Celtics liked what they saw from Antetokounmpo, but they decided to take Gonzaga forward/center Kelly Olynyk with their 2013 first-round pick instead. The C's made a trade with the Dallas Mavericks (who owned the No. 13 pick) to select Olynyk, whose ability to handle the ball and shoot well from the outside as a big man was appealing.Antetokounmpo ultimately was taken by the Milwaukee Bucks with the 15th pick. The \"Greek Freak\" has since become one of the league's best players and arguably is the leading candidate for MVP this season. It's still hard to fault Ainge and other executives for passing on Antetokounmpo, though. He was a very raw talent, and other players in that draft class were expected to provide more immediate contributions.Click here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!

They run the same plays over and over again. All they do is flop and shoot free throws. Maybe they’re even ruining basketball. Who isn’t these days, right?Houston’s offense operates with rigid discipline. The Rockets run and run James Harden off screens until he finds a tenable matchup to exploit. Tenable, so we’re clear, is a loosely defined term for a player who only needs a sliver of space to shoot from anywhere on the floor, whose combined ball-handling and strength psychs out defenders and referees alike.It is repetitive, sure, but in a way that’s endlessly fascinating. The Rockets repeatedly put the ball in the hands of the one of the NBA’s most creative, destructive scorers and wait for him to find a sieve — or create one. Harden now holds the second-longest 30-point scoring streak in NBA history, breaking 31 games in Wednesday night’s loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves, and he’s averaging a league-scorching 36.5 points per game.I’d argue all that makes the Rockets more watchable than most teams, which dilly-dally for possessions at a time, only looking to optimize in the face of urgency. You won’t find any freewheeling action from Iguodala-types in Houston. Even Austin Rivers has (mostly) held himself in check. Every time I turn on a Rockets game, Harden or Chris Paul has possession of the ball and is on the cusp of doing something. The game becomes a successive highlight reel that doesn’t allow you to turn the dial.The same quality that makes the Rockets so entertaining right now — and will likely garner Harden a second MVP — might be what hurts them in the playoffs again. The fuse is burning bright: Harden holds the ball an average of 9.6 seconds when he touches it, the highest mark in the NBA. His usage rate is 39 percent, smashing second place by 7 percent. What Harden’s doing might not be the best idea for the Rockets’ future outlook.But it’s definitely not boring. Even on defense, an opponent can make a name for himself with a signature moment against Harden — just ask Josh Okogie.As for as Harden’s high free-throw attempts bogging the game down, I won’t be convinced that a generation that cuts away to their iPhone screen 50 times per day is that bothered by an opportunity to look away from the action. When Harden’s playing, it’s the only chance you’re going to get.Because it seems like it, at least in the East. For the past few weeks, the dominant Warriors storyline has been about how Kevin Durant’s impending free agency could impact their title run. After a win against the Utah Jazz two nights ago, Durant said he feels the team is not playing well. These are the same Warriors, mind you, who are 16-3 since the New Year. Not only have they won all 11 games DeMarcus Cousins has played in — they’ve blown the tops off buildings, outscoring opponents by 9.7 points per 100 possessions. Until July 1, Warriors inevitability reigns.Why is it, then, that the Eastern Conference is littered with high-end teams that made big bets on winning this year? The Boston Celtics made their bed a while ago, with Kyrie Irving’s contract expiring when the season ends. The Toronto Raptors traded franchise cornerstone DeMar DeRozan for a chance to woo Kawhi Leonard for a season. Then they doubled down by trading for Marc Gasol. In sum, the 76ers exchanged Jerryd Bayless, Robert Covington, Dario Saric, Wilson Chandler, Mike Muscala, Landry Shamet, two first-round picks and two second-round picks for Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris, a pair of stars with deals that expire at the end of the year.(Side note: At least one of these three teams has to flame out in the second round. And then what does it do? For once, the playoff drama will be in the East, if not the title.)Could it be possible that the Warriors are so dominant that they’ve convinced the rest of the NBA to change the goalposts of ultimate success? Because as it stands right now, we’ve got a set of teams that went all in on trying to get to second place. It feels more like they’re auditioning for a post-Warriors future than trying to succeed in the current landscape. Even in a world where success is narrowly defined by wins and losses, perception is everything. And some things are inherent: If the rest of the NBA can’t compete against the Warriors, they still can’t help but compete against themselves.The aftermath of the most emboldened trade request in recent NBA history has been ugly. Anthony Davis is not a Laker — or a Knick or a Celtic or a Buck for that matter. And the New Orleans Pelicans don’t seem to have much use for him either. They’d rather sit him and pile up losses, focus on the lottery race and protect Davis’ health so they can trade him in the offseason. But the NBA issued a directive: The Pelicans would be fined $100,000 for every game he sat.So it is that after playing well enough to keep the Pelicans in it, Davis was benched in the fourth quarter two games in a row. Then, against the Orlando Magic, they got blown out by 30 points, which led to Davis — chef’s kiss — criticizing the team’s effort. So things aren’t good. What’s worse: It doesn’t seem like they’re going to get any better.Thanks to the NBA’s orders, this is the only reasonable compromise for both the Pelicans and Davis. He gets to pervert his livelihood — surely important to a man who has spent so many days involuntarily sidelined by injuries — while the Pelicans at least get to lose some of the time.Here’s what it comes down to: The NBA can’t make a decision that weighs the Pelicans real interests, because it can’t be so blithely rational about what’s best for them, which is tanking. In an alternate universe with no draft lottery, the Pelicans might at least be incentivized to let Davis play when it matters to get fans in seats. But the league won’t acknowledge its worst kept secret, so a dysfunctional situation is primed to only get worse.Nothing like the 76ers to get the Boston Celtics going. And nothing like a loss to the Celtics on Tuesday night to spread anxiety in the lives of 76ers fans.Despite the addition of Tobias Harris, the 76ers lost to the Kyrie-less Celtics in the same ways they’ve habitually lost to them: The Celtics stuck like glue to the few shooters the 76ers play at the same time and treated Ben Simmons like a non-entity, while Al Horford ate Joel Embiid’s lunch. The Sixers couldn’t protect the perimeter on the other end, so they never got much of a chance to get out in transition.I won’t write them off as quickly as I did after Christmas, if only because Harris is the type of sharpshooter who could tip the scales in favor of an old-school style — if they’re willing to embrace it.Since trading for Jimmy Butler in November, the Sixers are seventh in pace, 11th in defense and 16th in offensive rebounding. This is a team with three starters who are above 6-foot-8, including the league’s most imposing center since Shaq, but it’s stuck in the middle because it’s trying to fit old-school parts into a new-school game. The league has been crashing full-tilt into more space and pace for years, so you can forgive the Sixers for trying, but you don’t win championships by playing against your strengths.Philadelphia should be slow, plodding, muscly and mean. It should crash the glass with impunity, hunt cross-matches with pick-and-rolls and bully defenders in the post. The mere idea of entering the paint against the 76ers should make opponents cower with fear.The only rub is that slowing it down doesn’t serve Ben Simmons’ style, but they’re going to have to figure out the inevitable tension between his transition-happy game and Embiid’s half-court dominance eventually. Better to do it while playing to your strengths and find out if it works now, instead of two years down the road.Following Jeremy Lin’s first game as a Raptor, he took to the podium and shared some interesting thoughts on the presence of the international media. Here are some snippets, from the Toronto Star:“Yeah, [Mandarin media] probably happens in every city that has a strong Asian contingent,” Lin said. “Happened in Atlanta as well, but not this. So again, I’m very proud to represent Asian people on a global platform, on a global scale. And for me to be here where there’s a lot of Asians, like, I used to run from it, you know?“Because that’s all anybody’s ever wanted to look for. Like, ‘Oh, he’s Asian, he’s Asian, he’s Asian.’ And I was like, talk about my basketball. But now people can see I can play, I belong in the NBA, and I’ve really embraced just being able to represent Asians and do it the right way, hopefully.“Yeah, I mean, I think I was really jaded after the New York stretch,” Lin continued. “I think there was a lot of things that happened that made me give up a little bit on people, per se. And that was a huge part of the story, and that was a huge point of contention for a lot of people as to why I was getting the publicity, or why things were the way they were.“So I kind of wanted to run from that a little bit. I would probably say three years down the road, I kind of turned a corner, and I would say being hurt for two straight years, and seeing that my Asian fan base, I don’t feel like it dropped off one bit. And I haven’t even touched the court. Like, every year I go over to Asia and I can’t even walk through the airport — it’s insane. So to see them do that after all the highs and lows, but really going through the lows post-Linsanity, which culminated in those injuries, for me, I’m still blown away. And again, that’s fed into why I want to carry myself a certain way.”I don’t have a lot to say here, except that it’s touching to see a man whose identity was leveraged and controlled by outside forces for so long get to stop running away from how he’s perceived and finally be himself: an NBA player who once turned the basketball universe on its head, an Asian-American, a God-fearing Harvard grad. He has lived long enough in the public eye that the public has finally accepted what they originally thought were contradictory traits. That, friends, is how stereotypes are broken.More from Yahoo Sports:• PGA Tour pro defends paying caddie $5K on $1.3M win • NFL bars NCAA’s all-time sack leader from combine • Only one NBA team failed to scout Antetokounmpo • Black History honor for Kaepernick sacked by lawmakers Isaiah Thomas gets standing ovation, drills 3-pointer in Nuggets debut originally appeared on nbcsportsboston.comBrad Stevens could have begun his All-Star vacation Wednesday night after the Boston Celtics defeated the Detroit Pistons.But Stevens had a Denver Nuggets game to catch.The Celtics head coach set his DVR for Nuggets-Sacramento Kings to watch his former star player, Isaiah Thomas, make his Denver debut after a lengthy absence caused by offseason hip surgery.Thomas didn't disappoint.

In any case, you have to admit the NBA never fails to entertain.More from Yahoo Sports: • Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight When spring training camps opened this week around Major League Baseball, it brought hope that maybe, finally, Bryce Harper and Manny Machado would sign with teams and baseball’s long free-agent freeze would melt away.Nope. Not yet. Not only has that not happened, something else did happen: a number of talented young players around the league have agreed to team-friendly contract extensions.The latest was New York Yankees ace Luis Severino, who on Friday reportedly agreed to a four-year, $40 million deal. The deal, first reported by Joel Sherman of the New York Post, would buy up Severino’s arbitration years and comes with a $15 million club option for his first year of free agency.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]By agreeing to this deal, the Yankees and Severino avoid arbitration for 2019. He’ll make $4 million this season, $10 million next, then $10.25 million in 2021 and $11 million in 2022. The club option is for 2023. In the grand scheme of society, this is a very generous contract. In baseball’s economic bubble, it’s another young player signing for below-market value relative to his skills and potential.It’s hard to blame Severino for taking the deal, looking around at a free-agent world where Harper and Machado are still available, as are Dallas Keuchel and Craig Kimbrel. Especially since we haven’t heard even slight grumblings about teams being interested in Keuchel and Kimbrel.Coming off a breakout season in which he went 19-8 with a 3.39 ERA, the 25-year-old Severino was given a deal that’s pretty hard to turn down: “Do you want $40 million guaranteed, yes or no?”The other players faced with a similar question this week were Philadelphia Phillies ace Aaron Nola, who said yes to a four-year, $45 million deal Wednesday. It also avoided arbitration and bought out two of Nola’s free agency years, making it the most below-market deal of any of these.The Minnesota Twins locked up two of their talented young players Thursday, as right fielder Max Kepler agreed to a five-year, $35 million deal with a $10 million club option for 2024. It buys out three years of free agency for Kepler, 26. Shortstop Jorge Polanco also agreed to a five-year extension, his is worth $25.75 million with two option years that could keep him in Minnesota through 2025.In a vacuum, these types of extensions look like win-wins: The players get guaranteed money as they’re coming off good seasons. The clubs get cost-certainty to help them navigate the future — whether it’s the Yankees and Phillies trying to add big free agents this year or next, or a team like the Twins striving for contention with a homegrown core.In a bigger sense, though, it’s hard not to look at these deals in the current state of free agency and wonder if they’re a symptom of something else. Is it the market correcting itself? Is it baseball’s economy morphing into something new? Or maybe it’s just players looking around and saying, “Well, I better get my money now.”According to numerous reports, there’s a fear that for this generation of young players the light at the end of the tunnel — the big free-agency payday — won’t be there for them in the same way it was for so many other players.So while it’s great that stars like Justin Verlander, Clayton Kershaw and Max Scherzer are publicly speaking out about the current state of free agency, they’re on the right side of it. They got their mega deals.The younger players find themselves in a different sort of peril. It’s entirely possible that these are the biggest paydays these players ever get, which is a much different economic model that we’ve seen from baseball in the past.Whether it’s right or wrong — and that’s certainly something that’s up for debate heading into the next collective-bargaining agreement — baseball’s economy has often been backward. Players get paid less, relative to the market, in their pre-free agency years. The best recent example is Mike Trout winning the MVP in 2014 at age 22 while making $1 million.He got a raise to $6 million the next season, but in 2015 was still making a fraction of what people like Ryan Howard ($25M), Albert Pujols ($24M), Joe Mauer ($23M), Mark Teixeira ($22.5M) and Jose Reyes ($22M) were making.But that overpay is a necessary part baseball’s economic ecosystem too. It’s a fact: Players get overpaid as their careers decline. It’s almost like baseball’s way of making up for underpaying players during their early years. It’s baseball’s golden parachute. What’s happening these days is fewer teams are accepting that overpay as part of the how the system works.In the past few years, arbitration salaries have gotten higher and higher, and teams have tried harder to lock up younger stars before free agency. It’s why we’ve see players like Madison Bumgarner, Chris Archer, Chris Sale and Paul Goldschmidt become valuable trade chips for their team-friendly contract extensions.Teams are getting smarter about where their money goes, and how to keep value in their assets. These extensions to Severino, Nola and the rest show that they’re willing to spend money, just in the way that they want.Earlier this week, former Miami Marlins president David Samson tweeted something in response to Justin Verlander, saying the “broken system” talk was wrong. Players and their agents, Samson said, needed to adjust to a “new reality.”He may be right about the new reality part. The monster paydays at the end of the free agency tunnel could be fading away. If Bryce Harper and Manny Machado can’t get them, who can?The new reality could be players seizing their money. Whenever they can.– – – – – –Mike Oz is a writer at Yahoo Sports.

Follow @MikeOzMore from Yahoo Sports:• Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlightSt. Louis Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright became the latest player to forecast a “doom and gloom” outlook for Major League Baseball based on the growing financial and philosophical disconnect between the players and the owners.The sentiment that a strike will happen is one we’ve become accustomed to hearing from the players. However, Wainwright framed the situation with a little more urgency on Friday by expressing concerns that a day of reckoning could happen sooner than later.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]Speaking to InsideSTL.com’s Tim McKernan, Wainwright said it was inevitable that the players will go on strike unless major changes are made to help bridge the widening gap. But he’s also worried that frustrations could reach a boiling point during the season leading to some form of a revolt. Perhaps even a mid-season walkout.#STLCards pitcher Adam Wainwright on @TMASTL: “Unless something changes, there’s going to be a strike. 100%. I’m just worried people are going to walk-out mid-season.” pic.twitter.com/M8WeRVcASe— Tim McKernan (@tmckernan) February 15, 2019“Unless something changes, there’s going to be a strike. 100%,” Wainwright said regarding the free-agent freeze that has left stars like Bryce Harper and Manny Machado without contracts. “I’m just worried people are going to walkout midseason.”It’s conceivable given the current climate, but a players revolt on that level still feels like a long shot. The target date we should all still be looking at is Dec. 1, 2021. That’s when the current collective bargaining agreement ends and the owners will be forced to come to the table.That doesn’t mean we should just dismiss Wainwright’s concerns about a 2019 strike. While they might feel a little on the dramatic side, the frustration that has built all offseason as dozens of free agents, including and especially Harper and Machado, remain unsigned is becoming more palpable by the day. There’s a genuine feeling that owners are determined to cut back on salaries even as profits continue to reach new heights, it’s possible the players’ patience will run out if the free-agent freeze continues to drag on. Wainwright thinks so, and he’s far from alone.In Friday’s interview, the 37-year-old right-hander also criticized owners and front offense personnel for placing too much emphasis on “analytics” and placing everything in a “sabermetric box” that discounts intangibles and other immeasurable aspects of baseball.Adam Wainwright said today on ⁦@TMASTL⁩ that he expects there to be a strike “100%.”The context of the conversation comes from a discussion on how Bryce Harper and Manny Machado are still without teams.You can see Wainwright’s reasoning in the video below. pic.twitter.com/GXsmx4cXk1— Tim McKernan (@tmckernan) February 15, 2019Wainwright admitted that there’s always risk in making long-term financial commitments to players, but emphasized that doing so marks a commitment to winning that several teams seemingly lack.“Part of it is smart from their side of it, but you have to realize it’s about winning. So, if Bryce Harper wants 10 years and he’s 26 years old. He’s going to be a dynamic player. The same can be said about Manny Machado. These guys are superstar players.”The deeper we get into it the more obvious it is that the players know what battles lie ahead. The only real question is how much worse it will get before any progress is made toward a satisfactory resolution.More from Yahoo Sports:• Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight MLB rumors: Bryce Harper has made his decision, says D.C. radio host originally appeared on nbcsportsbayarea.comA report has come out from the East Coast saying Bryce Harper has come to a decision on which team he will play for in 2019 and beyond.Chris Russell, a sports radio talk show host from 106.7 The Fan in Washington D.C., (who has been on the Harper beat for some time) said the free agent slugger could make a decision in the next 24 hours.\"Maybe I took a little bit of a leap of faith here based on some indications I got from a real good source,\" Russell told 94WIP, in Philadelphia, on Friday.\"Bryce and his representatives, (Scott) Boras, his people, his wife Kayla, they've been meeting since Monday morning in Vegas. Bryce originally wanted this done, when it took this long, by Valentine's Day. Obviously, the contract has not been announced, signed, or whatever.\"\"But I'm led to believe by the people that I've talked to that are close to the situation -- and I have, again, a real good source that has helped me through this process, let's just leave it at that,\" Russell said. \"That Bryce was in a mood to celebrate yesterday. Now, the source said, 'I believe it's done.' I don't have concrete, 100 percent proof for you guys. I wish I did, otherwise, I would have it and I would be running around with it. But I don't have that, so I want to caution everybody in Philadelphia. But that's what I was led to believe, that this thing is now decided.\"Russell then mentioned the Phillies.\"Now, what comes then is hammering out a contract. And if we were to believe the report that the Philadelphia Phillies had not even extended a formal offer -- and I assume that to be a termed, written agreement, that type of thing, which I find hard to believe -- then there might be more legwork to this. And therefore, hey the decision may be done, but the contract still needs to be ironed out.\"[RELATED: Phillies fan participates in \"lent\" in hopes of recruiting Harper]Russell is being safe with the terminology he's using, which is understandable. And while we haven't been able to confirm these rumors, Harper, along with many other free agents, remains unsigned.The Giants appeared to be the \"mystery team\" that introduced themselves late into the Harper sweepstakes -- and when the radio hosts asked Russell his opinion on where the outfielder will end up next season, he believed Harper will be in an orange and black uniform.\"I don't think it's going to be the Nationals,\" Russell said. \"I think it's going to be the San Francisco Giants, but that is not by any means an 'I know that for a fact,' so I want to caution everybody -- I know how this works -- I get in trouble with everything I say on my radio show, and everyone blows it up.\" The wait continues ... Golden State Warriors stars Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant empathised with Steve Kerr after the head coach was ejected during the loss to the Portland Trail Blazers having thrown a clipboard in response to a flagrant foul call.Kerr was enraged late in the fourth quarter when Draymond Green was called for a flagrant foul after he stopped Zach Collins from approaching the rim as he went up for a shot.That drew Kerr's ire and after ranting in one referee's face, he slammed a clipboard down to earn an ejection, with Durant having to escort his head coach back off the court.The Warriors lost the game 129-107 but will still head into the All-Star break with the best record in the Western Conference.\"It was an emotional game. We fought really hard for 43 minutes,\" Curry told reporters afterwards.\"One questionable decision - the flagrant - obviously the fire came out. You see coach go and throw a clipboard. At that point you try to get us over the hump. An eight-point swing, it's tough to overcome.\"\"I looked at the replay and the amount of ball [Green] got, there was nothing excessive about it, he got all the ball.\"There was a lot of chirping, with Zach involved. There was probably a sensitivity to it, trying to put out some fires, but I thought it was a terrible call. We obviously paid the price for it with how everything unfolded after that.\"Durant shared that sympathy having been the one to pull Kerr away from the referees as he continued to rant at them.\"I felt for him, I understand his anger and his rage, especially for that call,\" he said.\"I thought we should have just kept playing, It was a common foul, I thought. Refs looked at it differently. \"I understand why coach was a little frustrated.\"Kerr explained that it was the disbelief at the call that had triggered his reaction.\"I was just shocked that that was called a flagrant foul,\" he said. \"I'm not sure how it's determined - if it's in New York or the officials on the call - but that was head-scratching: that that could be called a flagrant foul.\"The guy's going to go in for a dunk, you've got to make sure he doesn't dunk it.\"So, I told Kenny [Mauer] that I beg to differ. There might have been a couple of other words in there too!\"I'll have to ask the owner if the clipboard broke when I threw it down. I got a little anger out so that was good. I was too busy yelling to ask for an explanation.\"Charles Barkley thinks New Orleans Pelicans star Anthony Davis made a mistake with his trade request.The 25-year-old asked the Pelicans to move him in late January and the Los Angeles Lakers had been engaged in discussions about acquiring him. But, no deal was reached before the deadline and Davis remained with New Orleans.Barkley, an 11-time All-Star who works as an analyst for TNT, said he thinks Davis and his agent, Rich Paul, mishandled the situation.\"Don't ruin your reputation as a great player, one of the nicest guys in the world,\" Barkley told reporters on Thursday ahead of All-Star weekend (via the Washington Post).\"Remember, your agent works for you, you don't work for him. They handled that situation wrong. It's going to come back to bite them in the a***. It's unfortunate.\"The six-time All-Star entered play on Thursday averaging 28.5 points and 13.1 rebounds this season. But, he scored just three points in 24 minutes on the floor in the Pelicans' 118-88 loss to the Orlando Magic earlier this week.\"This is a bad situation,\" Barkley said. \"It's a bad look for the NBA. Because that kid can't go out there and give 100 per cent because he’s worried about getting hurt. The guy's the second-best player in the world and he's got three points? That's not a good look for the NBA.\"The Boston Celtics and New York Knicks, among others, are expected to explore dealing for Davis after the season. Barkley, however, said he believes the forward will eventually land in Los Angeles because of Paul's relationship with Lakers star LeBron James.Barkley tallied 22.1 points and 11.7 rebounds per game over his 16-year career. He retired in 2000 and was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame six years later.After an apology from Sergio Garcia, a non-apology from Matt Kuchar, and an uncooperative Mother Nature on Valentine's Day, it's time for everyone to focus again on Tiger Woods. Kidding. Sort of. A weather-delayed first round at Riviera re-starts on Friday morning and the 14-time major champ will be in the Hollywood-area spotlight as he finally begins his Genesis Open. And golf fans could potentially see a LOT of the tournament host as the event tries to play catch up after heavy rains on Thursday.Woods, Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas (Decent group, eh?) are scheduled to tee off at 8:32 local time (11:32 ET). The hope is they will complete their first rounds and then play as much of their second rounds as possible before darkness. And Tiger's hope is to finally win for the first time at this historic layout where he missed the cut last year. We'll be tracking Tiger every step of the way so keep it right here for the latest scores, news and highlights. (All times eastern)SATURDAY, 11:25: With a 25-foot birdie putt on No. 9, Woods' final hole of the second round, Tiger will likely make the cut. The birdie brought Woods back to even on his round and to one under overall.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096808527694245890After resuming play in the morning, Woods bogeyed his first hole, No. 4, then made four pars before his finishing birdie. His playing partners, however, fared much better. Justin Thomas shares the lead with Adam Scott at 11 under and Rory McIlroy birdied four of his six holes on Saturday morning to shoot 63 and move to seven under through 36 holes. Thursday's early wave is now on the course for their second rounds.-------------------FRIDAY-------------------8:25: And with that, the horn has sounded—play will be suspended for darkness on Friday at Riviera. Tiger, JT and Rory have six more holes to complete their second round. Justin Thomas is at 10-under, tied with Adam Scott for the lead. Tiger will hope Saturday brings some different momentum for him—as this marathon day ends with two bogeys in a row after the highlight eagle.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10965708926692065298:21: That's back-to-back bogeys now for Tiger Woods, dropping another shot here at the third hole (his 12th of the round). And over his past six holes, Tiger has four bogeys. The birdie at No. 1 helped negate most of that damage ... but Tiger's back to 1-under again—right on the current cut line.8:13: On his 30th hole of the day, Tiger is showing some obvious signs of being tired. And who could blame him—he's been playing golf for nearly 10 hours straight. From 165 yards out at the third hole, Tiger Woods tries to chop out a 6-iron and comes out of it. His ball comes to rest short of the green. With sunset in Pacific Palisades being 5:30 local time, this group will have time for maybe one more hole today.8:04: Tiger follows up that eagle putt at No. 1 with a bogey at the second hole. The third bogey of his second round moves Tiger back to 2-under overall.7:56: After a long wait at the second hole, Tiger sprays his second shot from 235 out with a fairway wood out to the right. He'll have his work cut out from the front right bunker to save par at the 482-yard par 4.7:40: This is exactly what Tiger Woods needed: He rolls in his 43-foot eagle putt at his 10th hole (the first) to get back to 3-under—negating those two bogeys he made on his front nine. What a putt! With the flagstick in!https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096570892669206529Tiger made a disappointing par to open his first round earlier today at the first hole. The unlikely eagle makes up for that effort—and could turn around Tiger's second round in a dramatic way. Tiger goes from toeing the cut line at 1-under to now all of a sudden being T-21.7:28: Tiger finds the fairway at the par-5 first hole, the group's 10th hole of their second round, as he attempts to get a shot back here after bogeying two of his final three holes on his front nine. Neither bogey was particularly bad—the 18th hole is playing brutally tough right now uphill and into the wind with the rain, making it even more of a challenging hole. And his break at 16 was very unlucky.7:16: Tiger and JT are gonna have their work cut out to save par at the 18th hole (their ninth). Each player had fairway wood approaches and tried playing a big cut. JT was way up left on the hill—Tiger was closer. He went high with his approach and will have about 11 feet left for par.Tiger misses the par putt, so he'll drop a shot along with JT as they make the turn. Tiger moves back to 1-under after 27 holes. That's where the cut line currently is—so all of a sudden, Tiger must be concerned about making the cut.7:01: Following Justin Thomas throwing a dart at the 17th to about 3 feet, Tiger puts his wedge shot from under 100 yards to outside 20 feet, so he'll be disappointed with that effort. The birdie putt misses on the high side, and Tiger taps in for par to remain at 2-under. His playing partner and buddy Justin Thomas stays hot, rolling in a fourth straight birdie to get to 9-under—tied for the lead with Adam Scott. Really impressive golf here from JT.6:54: The rain is really coming down now as the players head to the 17th hole. Tiger finds the fairway at the par-5 17th hole, but it was a short one—he has 326 yards left. Most players have been laying up at this par 5 all day.6:43: From a brutal position up against the back lip of the bunker, Tiger hacks it out—and somehow keeps the ball on the green, albeit the back portion. His par attempt from 44 feet away here comes up three feet shy. Tiger makes his bogey to move back to 2-under.Meanwhile, Justin Thomas is officially on fire. He has another birdie after a fabulous tee shot at 16. It's now two Kentucky boys tied at the top: Justin Thomas and J.B. Holmes (-8).https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10965576791939317766:39: Tiger will have serious lie issues at the par-3 16th hole. His tee shot came to rest up against the back lip of the bunker. As Billy Kratzert just remarked on PGA Tour Live, Tiger will do well just to keep this ball on the green. Though he avoided dropping a shot on his last hole, there might be a bogey in his future here.6:35: A clutchhh par save by Tiger at the 15th hole makes up for his poor chip—and Tiger keeps the momentum going on his second round, as he stays 3-under for the tournament and 2-under on the round.Justin Thomas, also in Tiger's group, holed out from in front of the green for birdie at the 14th hole, and he makes a long birdie putt at 15 to get to 7-under—just one back of fellow Kentucky native J.B. Holmes.6:32: A poor chip shot from Tiger at the 15th hole leaves him about 13 feet away. He'll need to convert that putt to prevent dropping his first shot of his second round.6:24: Tiger finds another fairway here at Riviera, this one at the 15th hole. The guy is feeeling it with his driver. Almost on auto pilot. His approach from 190 out turns a little too much, finding the rough to the left of the green. He'll have to get up and down to avoid dropping one here.6:20: From 20 feet out, Tiger's birdie bid comes up shy—never really scaring the hole, despite getting a good look at the line from Rory's putt. Tiger taps in for par to remain at 3-under.The putter has been disappointing for Tiger all day: He had 34 putts in his first round, including four three-putts, just the third time in his career he's done that.6:13: Tiger puts his tee shot at the par-3 14th hole just inside Rory's ball—about 20 feet right of the hole. He'll get a little teach from Rory's putt, too, as Tiger continues to hit it well today.6:07: Tiger just misses the left-to-right curling bid for birdie, leaving himself with an easy par at 13. He stays 3-under for the tournament and -2 through four on his round.Tiger's playing partners are also playing well—Rory has three birdies in his first four holes to get to 2-under. Look out for Rory at rainy Riviera. And Justin Thomas, despite hitting his tee shot out of bounds at 13, got up and down from 160 yards to avoid dropping multiple shots. He's now 5-under after that bogey.6:02: Another grooved tee shot for Tiger Woods at the 13th hole puts him in good position. He turned over his tee shot—putting his draw in the middle of the fairway at the dogleg left. Tiger spins his approach back to about 15 feet, just off the green in the fringe. He'll have a chance to knock another one here and keep the momentum going.5:51: Bang! Tiger nails the 25-footer for birdie at the 12th hole to add a second birdie to his card through three holes. Realistically, too, it could be three straight birdies for Tiger. But the 14-time major champion is now 2-under through 3—T-3 for the tournament (T-19)—and carries some strong momentum on his side at the start of his second round ... as the rain is coming down at Riviera.5:46: Tiger hits his approach hole high—about 25 feet from 181 yards. He'll have another chance to add a birdie to his third round.Tiger's currently at 2-under, which puts him at T-29. The projected cut is at 1-under—so he's comfortably inside the number as of now. But there's a ton of golf to be played, obviously.5:41: Tiger finds the fairway with his driver at the par-4 12th hole. The 12th usually plays as one of the toughest holes at Riviera—we'll see if Tiger can take advantage of his position here in the fairway.5:33: An excellent fairway-wood second shot by Tiger put him right in front of the par-5 11th green in two. But a very poor approach putt for his third leaves him more than 10 feet away. His birdie try slides by for a very disappointing par being so close in 2. That should've been a golden opportunity to start his second round with two birdies—instead, Tiger stays at 2-under.5:12: Tiger goes high with his pitch—having to navigate around the front bunker, and plays it nicely—spinning it about 7 feet short of the hole. So Tiger will have a good look for an opening birdie to start his second round. Tiger converts the birdie putt to move to 2-under.5:02: Only a little more than a half hour after finishing his first round, Tiger Woods (-1) -- along with Justin Thomas (-5) and Rory McIlroy (+1) -- has teed off in his second round. The group started on the drivable 10th hole, and Tiger has driven his tee shot just off the green. He'll have a chance to put his pitch shot close to start his second round with a birdie.4:24: Tiger narrowly misses the birdie putt at the 18th hole, so he'll tap in for a par and an opening-round, one-under 70 at Riviera. Having three-putted for a fourth time on the 17th hole to drop a shot in disappointing fashion, Tiger will head to his second round a bit frustrated. But the four consecutive birdies showed him being able to score well at Riviera, where he has never won.Tiger, JT (who birdied 18 to finish at 5-under) and Rory will head right back for their second round in this marathon day for them.4:18: Tiger responds to that shocking three-putt with a perfect drive and a towering 6-iron on Riviera's famed 18th. Woods is in good shape to at least make par the difficult hole, but as we've seen all day, a two-putt is anything but automatic.Here's an unusual stat on Tiger three-putting four times this afternoon. He's making some history in a bad way...https://twitter.com/JustinRayGolf/status/10965196250582507574:06: So much for the momentum. . . After a decent approach shot that spins back to about 20 feet, Woods runs his birdie putt a couple feet by and. . . gulp. . . misses the comebacker from about two feet. Wow. That's four three-putts on the day as Tiger falls back to one under with one hole to play.3:57: Uh-oh, it's raining in southern California again. Meanwhile, Woods is plodding his way up the par-5 17th. After pulling his drive into the left rough and drawing a poor lie, Woods pushed his layup slightly into the first cut of the right rough. He'll have a some sort of wedge to a back-right hole location.3:50: Tiger's tee shot was tracking on the par-3 16th, but it comes up about 30 feet short. From there, he two-putts for par to remain at two under. Justin Thomas makes his 10-foot birdie effort to move to four under, while Rory McIlroy remains at one over. McIlroy hast two holes to avert his first over-par score of 2019.3:40: After another great drive and a solid approach, Woods races his birdie attempt nearly five feet past the hole. But he keeps the overall positive momentum going by converting the par putt to remain at two under. Tiger has three more holes to play. At least, before he gets a lunch break.3:24: BANG! There's the bounce back from Tiger. It just came one hole later. And from farther away as Woods drains his 12-footer for birdie on No. 14.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096507996031467520Woods is now back to two under, five shots behind Jordan Spieth, who has to be pleased to still be in front by two despite these soft conditions.3:17: Tiger hits a great shot on the difficult par-3 14th hole to about 15 feet. He'll have a good look at birdie coming up. In the meantime, here's a look at how the leader board stands with Jordan Spieth still leading the way.Jordan Spieth (-7) 2t. Tony Finau (-5) 2t. Patrick Rodgers (-5) 2t. Kramer Hickok (-5) 2t. Davis Love III (-5) 2t. Adam Scott (-5) 2t. J.B. Homes (-5)Click here for full scores.3:13: Woods stuck his approach to about four feet below the hole on No. 13. A bounce back birdie looked like a forgone conclusion until he pushed his effort. Woof. That's two three-putts and two short misses on the greens for Tiger today. He remains at one under. Meanwhile, Rory McIlroy, after getting to two under through eight, has fallen to one over after back-to-back bogeys. Justin Thomas, the third player in the group, continues to lead this trio at three under.3:05: After hitting fade after fade, Woods steps to the 13th tee and rips a draw around the corner, perfectly setting up his next shot. Good to see him working it both ways with ease.3:01: Tiger pushed his tee shot into the right rough, then hit a fantastic recovery shot from a thick lie onto the green. He had a long look at birdie that rolled about four feet past, leaving him with a tricky left-to-right par putt, which he missed. That's three three putts on the day for Woods, and he's still one under.2:39: Not the best chip from Woods, as he left himself about six feet for birdie, but he makes it anyway. Four straight for Tiger to get to two under for the day.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10964952191957975042:30: Woods rips a 3-wood from 269 to just in front of the green. Hate to jinx him, but there's no reason he shouldn't easily make his fourth straight birdie here (ducks).2:20: Three in a row for Woods as he rolls in another at No. 10 and moves to one under. If he finds the fairway again at the 11th, four in a row will be in his sights. Meanwhile, Rory makes his par to stay at one under and JT ends up holing his 10 footer for birdie to get to four under. Finally a little bit of JUICE from this threesome.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096489287753711616https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096489787672780800By the way, it looks like we know when they'll be heading back out for round two later today. Here's an update from the Tiger Tracker:https://twitter.com/GCTigerTracker/status/1096481806067523585That should give them enough time to get at least 11 or 12 holes in.At the 11th, Woods stripes another drive down the fairway. He's really starting to cook.2:12: Tiger's shot was a tad more difficult than we thought, as he had to avoid a bunker and take it up high to get it back to the pin. He was successful, sticking it to about three feet. Hell of a shot. Even better was Rory's shot, as he flopped it from a nice lie and got it to hang on just off the back of the green and stay out of the back bunker. Thomas, who had the easiest shot, put too much spin on his chip, leaving himself with about 10 feet for birdie.2:07: Finally, Tiger, Rory and JT hit their tee shots, and it looks like the ensuing entertainment will be well worth the wait. Tiger is in the collection area left of the green, where he has a straightforward chip that should set him up with a good chance to make birdie. Thomas is just in front of the green, and he'll have a great chance to make a birdie as well. Rory ... um ... not so much. He's in the rough with a greenside bunker in front of him and a pin he won't be able to get close to, and just holding the green would be a miracle.1:52: Woods drains his four-footer for bird and turns in even par 35. Real strong finish to his opening nine, and now it looks like he'll have a long wait at the 10th. DeChambeau, Kuchar and Rahm have still yet to hit their tee shots.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10964831254067896321:47: Tiger had just 122 left to the green and stuck one in there close. He has four feet left for birdie to turn in even par, which would be a small victory after that ugly three putt back at No. 7. Not to mention he'll have a prime opportunity to get into red figures at the driveable par-4 10th.1:41: Woods cranks another high fade right down the middle with the driver at No. 9. With the tees up today, he'll have a low iron in his hand for his approach.1:34: And he's on the board! Woods bounces back with a birdie putt from 15 feet, getting him back to one over. We'll see if that gets him going before making the turn.1:30: From 125 yards out, Woods hit a wedge and hated it from the second he made contact. While he did pull it, he's still hole high and inside 20 feet. Hideki Matsuyama-esque move from Tiger.1:24: Woods rips one right down the middle at the par-4 eighth. Should have a short iron in.1:15: Tiger's birdie putt was actually from just off the green on the fringe, and he rolled it by some four feet. Then, he missed the comebacker for par, dropping to two over on the day. Oof.1:09: Fairway and a green for Woods at the seventh. Good look at birdie coming up to get back to level par.12:58: Another hole, another par for Woods, who two-putted from 24 feet on the par-3 sixth. In the group up ahead, though, Jon Rahm is making a move at three under through six.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/109646557828021452912:47: Another meh hole for Tiger on No. 5, just missing the fairway with his tee shot, finding the front of the green with a so-so approach, and two-putting for another par from 43 feet. Woods remains at one over through five holes while his playing partners, McIlroy and Thomas, both remain at one under.12:42: As Matt Kuchar's ball is in the air on the par-3 sixth, a fan yells, \"Go low—just not with the gratuity!\" Despite Matt maintaining this is \"not a story,\" it is. And this won't be the last comment like this.12:29: Woods hit a nice shot to about 15 feet on the par-3 fourth, but ran his birdie effort by the hole. Still one over. Still no highlights. At least, from Tiger. Here was Spieth's closing birdie from about an hour ago, because there is not much else exciting going on right now.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/109644546143346688112:17: Another missed fairway and another short approach from Tiger on the par-4 third. Although, Woods found the putting surface, he was unable to two-putt from 63 feet, missing a seven-footer for par after badly misreading his first putt. That drops Tiger to one over through three holes. Not a lot of highlights so far. . .12:02: Tiger misses right off the tee on No. 2 then comes up short on another approach. But his pitch shot nearly goes down, leaving him with a tap-in par. Even par through two holes.11:49: After that perfect opening tee shot, Tiger hit a hideous approach with a 5-iron that came up way short in a fairway bunker. From there, he hit his third to 10 feet but missed the putt to walk away with a disappointing par. Both of Tiger's playing partners, McIlroy and Thomas, make birdie.11:38: Matt Kuchar just misses his eagle attempt from 25 feet on No. 1, but taps in for birdie. Kuchar has been in the news a lot this week over a caddie controversy dating back to his win at the Mayakoba Golf Classic. A controversy he didn't help with his comments on Wednesday. Is it possible some of those \"Kuuuuch\" shouts will turn to \"Mooooch\"? Kinda sounded like it on the first hole. . .11:34: Jordan Spieth is in with a seven-under-par 64 to take the early lead. Spieth needed only 21 putts during his bogey-free round. Of course, starting tournaments hasn't been a problem for Spieth of late. Finishing, however, has been a different story. Incredibly, Spieth is looking for his first win since the 2017 British Open and his first top 5 since last year's Masters.11:32: Woods smashes a driver off the first tee that finds the fairway. The opening par 5 at Riviera is essentially a long par 4 and one of the easiest holes on the PGA Tour all year so Tiger is thinking at least birdie after that tee shot.10:53: So far, so good on the Friday weather:https://twitter.com/GCTigerTracker/status/1096437235262533632And with lift, clean and place in play (for at least the first round), low scores are out there. Let's set the over/under on the Par-71 layout at 68.5.10:45: We are approximately 45 minutes away from Tiger's tee time and it's another major champ who is already off to a fantastic start. Jordan Spieth has the lead at six under through 15 holes. Spieth leads Patrick Rodgers by one and then there's a big group at four under, including Bill Haas, who is playing in the event a year after being involved in a car accident during last year's tournament that killed a friend he was staying with. Make sure you read Brian Wacker's piece from earlier in the week on how Haas is still trying to move on from that tragedy.10:35: As we move within an hour from Tiger teeing off, check out GOLFTV's latest behind-the-scenes video with Woods in which he says his bag has up to 16(!) golf gloves during rainy rounds and he explains why he doesn't like wearing rain jackets:https://twitter.com/GOLFTV/status/1096246456795697153\"Pops used to say, 'Once you're wet, you're wet.

Once he started running the front office, his blinking at Paul George on national TV contributed to the Lakers getting fined again for tampering. Johnson’s praise of Giannis Antetokounmpo drew yet another tampering fine.So, though he escaped punishment for his recent comments on 76ers guard Ben Simmons, Johnson refused to answer a question about Hornets guard Kemba Walker.Carolina Blitz:Asked Magic about Kemba and he said y’all aren’t going to catch him slipping anymore. pic.twitter.com/sQZtIWnQbn— Carolina Blitz (@KeepBlitzin) February 15, 2019Johnson:You know I can’t answer any questions about no players, because every time I do it, I get fined. But anybody else do it, they don’t get fined. So I’m going to stay away from that one.I don’t blame Johnson for feeling that way.Other teams’ owners, coaches and executives have repeatedly publicly discussed rival players without facing announced punishment.To be fair, the NBA doesn’t reveal every fine. Bucks owner Marc Lasry reportedly just got fined for tampering, but the league never announced it. But, at minimum, there’s an inconsistency with how the NBA exposes Johnson’s transgressions.Even NBA commissioner Adam Silver said last year there’s a spotlight on the Lakers due to prior tampering. That strikes me as unfair. The Lakers already paid for their prior violations and should now be held to the same standard as everyone else.And for what it’s worth, I wish that standard allowed an all-time great point guard like Johnson to publicly share his thoughts on Kemba Walker.Gareth Bale has landed himself in hot water after La Liga denounced the Real Madrid star for his celebration in the Madrid derby, which could carry a ban of four to 12 games.The Welsh forward scored as a substitute in the 3-1 victory over Atletico Madrid, bringing up his 100th goal for the club.And during the celebrations that followed, Bale \"lifted his right arm near his head in a clear sign of provocation towards the fans, then giving a gesture which could be seen as obscene and disdainful by folding his arm and striking it with his other hand.\"In a statement released by La Liga, Bale’s punishment will be decided by whether he incited the crowd or not.If Bale is guilty of “inciting opposition fans” to cause a hostile reaction, the punishment could carry four to 12 games, if there was no hostile reaction but intent, then it could be as little as one to three games.The gesture is referred to in Spain as ‘corte de mangas,’ with the moment not picked up in the referee’s match report.A committee will now decide whether the gesture merits a punishment.Bale also featured in Real’s Champions League victory over Ajax.Los Blancos take a 2-1 lead back to the Bernabeu for the second leg of the last 16 tie after Marco Asensio’s late winner.Earlier this week Heisman Trophy winner — and first round draft pick of the Oakland Athletics — Kyler Murray chose football over baseball, committing himself to the NFL draft. It was a move that, however sensible from Murray’s point of view, has led to a lot of soul-searching among baseball folks and has raised questions about what the sport offers young, talented athletes with other options.It’s not that bleak, however! Another outstanding college football player said no to football this week and reaffirmed his commitment to baseball. Tim Tebow!

In the last month alone he's won his 44th PGA Tour event, finished second in another, hit every fairway in a round for the first time in 21 years, shot a 60, pulled off this impossible recovery shot, gone viral just by rolling his eyes and said he might drop the Players from his schedule because he's already won it (a literal mic drop). The man simply cannot be stopped right now.Leave it to the weather to literally rain on Lefty's parade. On Thursday at the Genesis Open, Mickelson began his first round at the difficult short par-4 10th and drove into one of the bunkers up near the green, leaving him with a dreaded lengthy sand shot. He wound up hitting it over the green, and his ball plugged in the back bunker, setting up an even harder shot than he just had. As you'll hear PGA Tour Live commentator Shane Bacon say, avoiding making a six was probably the goal, but after Mickelson hit his third into another bunker on the other side of the green, a six suddenly became best-case scenario. How does a four sound instead?https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096076528142626818Find us a more Phil Mickelson par ever... you can't. He's always got a flair for the dramatic. The problem? It's not going to count, as the tour wiped scores from the first 30 minutes of play due to the weather, thus making this the greatest par that never counted. It still counts in his mind though:https://twitter.com/PhilMickelson/status/1096106399958937605Peak Phil.RELATED: Where does Phil Mickelson rank among the greatest OMGs? (Old man golfers)The dust is barely settled in the wake of the end of the Markelle Fultz era in Philadelphia, and the former 76ers guard is already taking shots at his old team.His old coach Brett Brown in particular.Fultz had his introductory press conference with the Orlando Magic on Thursday after being traded at last week’s deadline and praised his new coach Steve Clifford while taking a veiled shot at Brown.“It just excites me to know that I have a coach that’s going to push you to be better and not just going to tell you what you want to hear,” Fultz said.That’s direct praise for his new coach. But the message for Brown is clear. Fultz didn’t like what he heard from the Philadelphia coaching staff.Fultz never had any public dispute with the 76ers, but it was evident that he and the team had different approaches to the struggles that saw him shoot 41.4 percent from the field, 26.7 percent from 3-point distance and 53.4 percent from the line in limited action after being selected as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2017 draft.It’s still not clear whether injury or a mental block – or both – are the cause of his shooting issues.After his agent announced that the nerve disorder thoracic outlet syndrome was the root of the shooting woes, Fultz never played again for the 76ers.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]Fultz appears to be fully embracing the fresh start in Orlando as a player and a person.“I think the biggest thing we talked about what doing thing the right way,” Fultz said. “Just building me up both as a man and on the court. I think that’s music to my ears, really just. Two things I really want to do is be the best player I can be and be the best young man I can be.”Fultz described the experience of his nerve disorder to reporters.“It’s hard to lift up your arms, you lose feeling in your fingers,” Fultz said. “You can’t tell when it’s going to happen. It’s not like you do the same motion every time. You get tingling in your fingers, numbness. Stuff like that.”He also curtly dismissed any notion that his shooting struggles are due to anything but injury.“I had an injury,” Fultz said. “I was out there trying to play through that. I never lost confidence.”Asked about a timetable to return, Fultz dodged the question to talk about rehab.“Right now it’s just about getting everything the right way,” he said. “Rehab’s been going great. I’m just taking my time and doing everything the right way.”More from Yahoo Sports: • PGA Tour pro defends paying caddie $5K on $1.3M win • NFL bars NCAA’s all-time sack leader from combine • Only one NBA team failed to scout Antetokounmpo • Black History honor for Kaepernick sacked by lawmakers He might not be well known to NFL fans at large, but New England Patriots fans know linebacker Kyle Van Noy — acquired basically for free from the Detroit Lions at the 2016 trade deadline — has been a big part of the defense the last two years, and has a knack for making plays at the right time.Van Noy is getting a little shine after winning his second Super Bowl ring with New England, appearing on the “Pardon My Take” podcast on Thursday to dish on all things Patriots and Super Bowl LIII.One thing that Van Noy revealed: the Los Angeles Rams didn’t do anything surprising during the game on offense.“I couldn’t believe that,” Van Noy said. “They really didn’t do — not one wrinkle. I was like, ‘What the hell?’ They’ve got so many good players, they’ve got so many things they’ve done all year, and the one play they gave us which was a wrinkle was the [Brandin] Cooks screen that hit for a little bit.“And that was it… Or maybe too, we were playing so good they were like, ‘[Expletive], we don’t know what to do.’ ”Hindsight, of course, is 20-20, but given that the Patriots’ coaching staff is known for having its players prepared for any and everything, it seems unwise that Los Angeles didn’t add some new plays or looks to try to stump New England.Van Noy said the Patriots’ culture, specifically coach Bill Belichick’s practice of not sparing anyone in the film room, even Tom Brady, is part of why the team continues to win.“Oh yeah. Yeah, that [stuff is] sick, to be honest, because it sets the table,” Van Noy said. “Like, OK, it doesn’t matter who you are, everyone’s on an even playing field. This is how it is here at work. You come in and you earn everything.“And I respect that because I felt like that gave me a chance to get on the field when I came in mid-year, and [Belichick] was like, ‘It doesn’t matter who you are or what you’ve done. You earn your keep.’ ”More from Yahoo Sports: • Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight The Brady Conundrum: How do you go about replacing the GOAT? originally appeared on nbcsportsboston.comThe Patriots hatched a Tom Brady succession plan after the 2013 season when they drafted Jimmy Garoppolo.Brady blew that up.Now, five years, four Super Bowl appearances, three Super Bowl wins, two Super Bowl MVPs and a regular-season MVP later, it's time to gingerly -- caaaauuuuuutiooooousssssllllyyyyy -- begin the process again.This time should be different.Even though Brady's contract hasn't been extended past the 2019 season, the love and happiness we saw on the field after the Rams were dispatched in SB53 is a good sign.MORE PATRIOTSAreas of Change: Will Pats be able to retain free agents Trey Flowers and Trent Brown?Brady's wariness about the Patriots' plans for him, and Bill Belichick's wariness about wedding his team to a quarterback who's closer to 50 years old than he is to 30, has dissipated.Once a new deal is in place -- Jonathan Kraft indicated that might be before training camp, though as of the Super Bowl conversations hadn't started -- Brady will have a written assurance that he will leave the Patriots and the NFL on his terms.That wasn't the case in early 2014 when the soon-to-be-37-year-old Brady saw the Patriots spend a first-round pick on a defensive tackle (Dominique Easley) and their second-rounder on Garoppolo. That, after a '13 season Brady spent throwing to the likes of Aaron Dobson, Josh Boyce, Kenbrell Thompkins and Austin Collie.Garoppolo was a stick of dynamite under Brady's behind. He was the existential threat Brady feared made flesh.Jimmy might have thought he was drafted to learn how to play quarterback in the NFL and have a nice career. To Brady, Garoppolo was there to take his job, throw his career into upheaval, uproot his family and see Brady cast out into the NFL wilderness.MORE PATRIOTSPerry: If Beckham is on the trade block, should Patriots be willing to pay the price?And, in contrast to the guy Brady succeeded in 2001 (and, by extension, did all those things to), Brady wasn't going to snort derisively at the plucky little draft pick here to take his job. He would crush the threat.He did.Brady played so well that -- despite Garoppolo developing into a bona-fide front-line quarterback under Belichick and Josh McDaniels (and Brady) -- Brady left the ever-prepared Patriots with no recourse when Garoppolo's contract was about to expire.Brady was too good to bench and too important to trade. Garoppolo was too expensive to franchise and too smart to take a \"bridge\" contract so he could watch Brady from the sidelines while his own hair started to gray at the temples. So off he went around Halloween, 2017.A lot's happened in the 16 months since.MORE PATRIOTSPhil Perry's Mock Draft 1.0: Pats start looking for Gronk's replacementBut now here we are, in the offseason of Brady's 42nd year. And the complex question of how to find the player who will eventually replace the greatest quarterback in NFL history still lingers.Do you draft his successor? If you do, do you do it this year? Do you do it next year?Do you try to get into the top 10 to get your pick of the litter? Do you stay put, confident that the muttonheads across the league will miss out as they did with Brady and Garoppolo (or Aaron Rodgers, Russell Wilson, Drew Brees, Brett Favre, Johnny Unitas . . . you get the point)? How much will it cost to get into the top 10? Do you package picks from this season -- when you will have six in the first three rounds -- and pick a sucker who will suck next year and fleece them for their 2020 first-rounder? How high do you have to go for a blue-chip, given the number of first-round quarterbacks that will be taken this year and that were taken in 2018?Is it a trade for somebody another team's given up on or has no work for, like San Francisco's Nick Mullens? A veteran who will hit free agency like Nick Foles, Case Keenum or Teddy Bridgewater?How does the successor play the position? Similar to Brady in that brain/eyes/accuracy/commitment trumps legs/arm strength/versatility?MORE PATRIOTSShould Pats be interested in Demaryius Thomas? No . . . and yesOr is there an embrace of the fact that trying to find a quarterback similar to a guy who came into the league after four years at Michigan at the end of last century with a once-in-a-lifetime work ethic is a pipe dream?Aside from who the successor is and how he plays, can Brady -- the lion in winter -- be tapped to help groom whoever is being brought aboard to take over?Brady -- contrary to sexed-up speculation -- didn't actively undermine Garoppolo at any point. They were teammates. He helped Garoppolo play the position better. They became close. But he wasn't quite showing him his world, either. Brady is famous for saying he's not giving away his secrets to younger quarterbacks until after he's done.With the end-date likely to be agreed upon when he signs an extension, does he become more a mentor so that the success of the franchise has a better chance to continue after he leaves? Would the Patriots want him to do that?Or would they want a blank(ish) slate to work with that isn't saying, \"But Tom said . . . \" when they try to shape him to succeed?And that contract? What's it look like? Does Brady demand pay commensurate with what he's accomplished? Is he in the mood to do the team another financial solid given the only bump they have him in 2018 was incentives he never reached? How does that impact the structure of the team?These questions aren't new. What is new is the level of angst and anxiousness. It's dissipated tremendously.That won't make finding his replacement or choosing the means by which the Patriots will do it any easier. But it's less fraught now.The irony is, the Patriots already successfully found Brady's successor. It's just that 2014 was too soon to go looking for him.Now, can they do it again?Click here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!

Before the team's loss to the Blazers on Wednesday night, he told ESPN that he \"wants to finish his career as a Warrior.\"      View this post on Instagram    Klay wants to stay in The Bay.A post shared by  espn (@espn) on Feb 13, 2019 at 9:23pm PSTThompson is set to be an unrestricted free agent at the end of the 2018-19 season.This isn't the first time Klay has made his feelings known. Even his father Mychal, who played five seasons for the Lakers, believes his son will re-sign with the Warriors. [RELATED: For Steve Kerr, Steph Curry and Klay Thompson are mix of NBA past and present]The Warriors selected Thompson with the No. 11 overall pick in the 2011 NBA Draft. Since then, he's been a five-time NBA All-Star, three-time Finals champion and two-time All-NBA selection. Anything could happen, but it's safe to say the Klay and the Dubs have quite the relationship and are ready to tie the knot.Jason Witten never worked with Kellen Moore as a coach, but he did practice with Moore when both of them were still active players with the Cowboys.That experience is enough for Witten to think Moore has “a way about him” that will pay off in his new job as the Cowboys offensive coordinator. Witten said this week that he believes Moore will be innovative and that the offense will take a “big step” by gearing things around quarterback Dak Prescott.“Yeah, I think he will do the things that Dak likes to do,” Witten said, via the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. “He will do the things they have to do to win. That is the way they have to play. I think they will use the pass to set up the run. Not just the run to set up the pass. I think he will add some nice wrinkles to that offense.”With head coach Jason Garrett coaching in the final year of his contract, Moore’s work with the offense will have a lot to do with how Dallas does in 2019 and with the path the team charts in the years that follow. If Witten’s correct, that path will probably look a lot like the one they’ve been on for a while.The story of Danny Ainge's Greece visit to watch Giannis Antetokounmpo is a wild one originally appeared on nbcsportsboston.comThe Boston Celtics took an early interest in Greece basketball star Giannis Antetokounmpo before he was selected in the 2013 NBA Draft.C's president of basketball operations Danny Ainge actually went over to Europe to watch Antetokounmpo play, and the postgame scene was nothing short of crazy.Fans were going wild, and some of them even yelled at Ainge because they thought he was associated with Antetokounmpo's team -- Ainge was sitting near its bench during the game.Check out the video below to hear the wild story of Ainge's scouting visit to Greece:Time for another \"Finding Giannis\" outtake. The first NBA team to scout Giannis was the Boston Celtics. As is often the case in Greece, hilarity ensued, as told by @GrgpanouOCT about Danny Ainge's visit. #FindingGiannis will be broadcasted Saturday on TNT at 630pm EST. pic.twitter.com/8bLjIjHv77— Jonathan Givony (@DraftExpress) February 14, 2019The Celtics liked what they saw from Antetokounmpo, but they decided to take Gonzaga forward/center Kelly Olynyk with their 2013 first-round pick instead. The C's made a trade with the Dallas Mavericks (who owned the No. 13 pick) to select Olynyk, whose ability to handle the ball and shoot well from the outside as a big man was appealing.Antetokounmpo ultimately was taken by the Milwaukee Bucks with the 15th pick. The \"Greek Freak\" has since become one of the league's best players and arguably is the leading candidate for MVP this season. It's still hard to fault Ainge and other executives for passing on Antetokounmpo, though. He was a very raw talent, and other players in that draft class were expected to provide more immediate contributions.Click here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!

They run the same plays over and over again. All they do is flop and shoot free throws. Maybe they’re even ruining basketball. Who isn’t these days, right?Houston’s offense operates with rigid discipline. The Rockets run and run James Harden off screens until he finds a tenable matchup to exploit. Tenable, so we’re clear, is a loosely defined term for a player who only needs a sliver of space to shoot from anywhere on the floor, whose combined ball-handling and strength psychs out defenders and referees alike.It is repetitive, sure, but in a way that’s endlessly fascinating. The Rockets repeatedly put the ball in the hands of the one of the NBA’s most creative, destructive scorers and wait for him to find a sieve — or create one. Harden now holds the second-longest 30-point scoring streak in NBA history, breaking 31 games in Wednesday night’s loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves, and he’s averaging a league-scorching 36.5 points per game.I’d argue all that makes the Rockets more watchable than most teams, which dilly-dally for possessions at a time, only looking to optimize in the face of urgency. You won’t find any freewheeling action from Iguodala-types in Houston. Even Austin Rivers has (mostly) held himself in check. Every time I turn on a Rockets game, Harden or Chris Paul has possession of the ball and is on the cusp of doing something. The game becomes a successive highlight reel that doesn’t allow you to turn the dial.The same quality that makes the Rockets so entertaining right now — and will likely garner Harden a second MVP — might be what hurts them in the playoffs again. The fuse is burning bright: Harden holds the ball an average of 9.6 seconds when he touches it, the highest mark in the NBA. His usage rate is 39 percent, smashing second place by 7 percent. What Harden’s doing might not be the best idea for the Rockets’ future outlook.But it’s definitely not boring. Even on defense, an opponent can make a name for himself with a signature moment against Harden — just ask Josh Okogie.As for as Harden’s high free-throw attempts bogging the game down, I won’t be convinced that a generation that cuts away to their iPhone screen 50 times per day is that bothered by an opportunity to look away from the action. When Harden’s playing, it’s the only chance you’re going to get.Because it seems like it, at least in the East. For the past few weeks, the dominant Warriors storyline has been about how Kevin Durant’s impending free agency could impact their title run. After a win against the Utah Jazz two nights ago, Durant said he feels the team is not playing well. These are the same Warriors, mind you, who are 16-3 since the New Year. Not only have they won all 11 games DeMarcus Cousins has played in — they’ve blown the tops off buildings, outscoring opponents by 9.7 points per 100 possessions. Until July 1, Warriors inevitability reigns.Why is it, then, that the Eastern Conference is littered with high-end teams that made big bets on winning this year? The Boston Celtics made their bed a while ago, with Kyrie Irving’s contract expiring when the season ends. The Toronto Raptors traded franchise cornerstone DeMar DeRozan for a chance to woo Kawhi Leonard for a season. Then they doubled down by trading for Marc Gasol. In sum, the 76ers exchanged Jerryd Bayless, Robert Covington, Dario Saric, Wilson Chandler, Mike Muscala, Landry Shamet, two first-round picks and two second-round picks for Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris, a pair of stars with deals that expire at the end of the year.(Side note: At least one of these three teams has to flame out in the second round. And then what does it do? For once, the playoff drama will be in the East, if not the title.)Could it be possible that the Warriors are so dominant that they’ve convinced the rest of the NBA to change the goalposts of ultimate success? Because as it stands right now, we’ve got a set of teams that went all in on trying to get to second place. It feels more like they’re auditioning for a post-Warriors future than trying to succeed in the current landscape. Even in a world where success is narrowly defined by wins and losses, perception is everything. And some things are inherent: If the rest of the NBA can’t compete against the Warriors, they still can’t help but compete against themselves.The aftermath of the most emboldened trade request in recent NBA history has been ugly. Anthony Davis is not a Laker — or a Knick or a Celtic or a Buck for that matter. And the New Orleans Pelicans don’t seem to have much use for him either. They’d rather sit him and pile up losses, focus on the lottery race and protect Davis’ health so they can trade him in the offseason. But the NBA issued a directive: The Pelicans would be fined $100,000 for every game he sat.So it is that after playing well enough to keep the Pelicans in it, Davis was benched in the fourth quarter two games in a row. Then, against the Orlando Magic, they got blown out by 30 points, which led to Davis — chef’s kiss — criticizing the team’s effort. So things aren’t good. What’s worse: It doesn’t seem like they’re going to get any better.Thanks to the NBA’s orders, this is the only reasonable compromise for both the Pelicans and Davis. He gets to pervert his livelihood — surely important to a man who has spent so many days involuntarily sidelined by injuries — while the Pelicans at least get to lose some of the time.Here’s what it comes down to: The NBA can’t make a decision that weighs the Pelicans real interests, because it can’t be so blithely rational about what’s best for them, which is tanking. In an alternate universe with no draft lottery, the Pelicans might at least be incentivized to let Davis play when it matters to get fans in seats. But the league won’t acknowledge its worst kept secret, so a dysfunctional situation is primed to only get worse.Nothing like the 76ers to get the Boston Celtics going. And nothing like a loss to the Celtics on Tuesday night to spread anxiety in the lives of 76ers fans.Despite the addition of Tobias Harris, the 76ers lost to the Kyrie-less Celtics in the same ways they’ve habitually lost to them: The Celtics stuck like glue to the few shooters the 76ers play at the same time and treated Ben Simmons like a non-entity, while Al Horford ate Joel Embiid’s lunch. The Sixers couldn’t protect the perimeter on the other end, so they never got much of a chance to get out in transition.I won’t write them off as quickly as I did after Christmas, if only because Harris is the type of sharpshooter who could tip the scales in favor of an old-school style — if they’re willing to embrace it.Since trading for Jimmy Butler in November, the Sixers are seventh in pace, 11th in defense and 16th in offensive rebounding. This is a team with three starters who are above 6-foot-8, including the league’s most imposing center since Shaq, but it’s stuck in the middle because it’s trying to fit old-school parts into a new-school game. The league has been crashing full-tilt into more space and pace for years, so you can forgive the Sixers for trying, but you don’t win championships by playing against your strengths.Philadelphia should be slow, plodding, muscly and mean. It should crash the glass with impunity, hunt cross-matches with pick-and-rolls and bully defenders in the post. The mere idea of entering the paint against the 76ers should make opponents cower with fear.The only rub is that slowing it down doesn’t serve Ben Simmons’ style, but they’re going to have to figure out the inevitable tension between his transition-happy game and Embiid’s half-court dominance eventually. Better to do it while playing to your strengths and find out if it works now, instead of two years down the road.Following Jeremy Lin’s first game as a Raptor, he took to the podium and shared some interesting thoughts on the presence of the international media. Here are some snippets, from the Toronto Star:“Yeah, [Mandarin media] probably happens in every city that has a strong Asian contingent,” Lin said. “Happened in Atlanta as well, but not this. So again, I’m very proud to represent Asian people on a global platform, on a global scale. And for me to be here where there’s a lot of Asians, like, I used to run from it, you know?“Because that’s all anybody’s ever wanted to look for. Like, ‘Oh, he’s Asian, he’s Asian, he’s Asian.’ And I was like, talk about my basketball. But now people can see I can play, I belong in the NBA, and I’ve really embraced just being able to represent Asians and do it the right way, hopefully.“Yeah, I mean, I think I was really jaded after the New York stretch,” Lin continued. “I think there was a lot of things that happened that made me give up a little bit on people, per se. And that was a huge part of the story, and that was a huge point of contention for a lot of people as to why I was getting the publicity, or why things were the way they were.“So I kind of wanted to run from that a little bit. I would probably say three years down the road, I kind of turned a corner, and I would say being hurt for two straight years, and seeing that my Asian fan base, I don’t feel like it dropped off one bit. And I haven’t even touched the court. Like, every year I go over to Asia and I can’t even walk through the airport — it’s insane. So to see them do that after all the highs and lows, but really going through the lows post-Linsanity, which culminated in those injuries, for me, I’m still blown away. And again, that’s fed into why I want to carry myself a certain way.”I don’t have a lot to say here, except that it’s touching to see a man whose identity was leveraged and controlled by outside forces for so long get to stop running away from how he’s perceived and finally be himself: an NBA player who once turned the basketball universe on its head, an Asian-American, a God-fearing Harvard grad. He has lived long enough in the public eye that the public has finally accepted what they originally thought were contradictory traits. That, friends, is how stereotypes are broken.More from Yahoo Sports:• PGA Tour pro defends paying caddie $5K on $1.3M win • NFL bars NCAA’s all-time sack leader from combine • Only one NBA team failed to scout Antetokounmpo • Black History honor for Kaepernick sacked by lawmakers Isaiah Thomas gets standing ovation, drills 3-pointer in Nuggets debut originally appeared on nbcsportsboston.comBrad Stevens could have begun his All-Star vacation Wednesday night after the Boston Celtics defeated the Detroit Pistons.But Stevens had a Denver Nuggets game to catch.The Celtics head coach set his DVR for Nuggets-Sacramento Kings to watch his former star player, Isaiah Thomas, make his Denver debut after a lengthy absence caused by offseason hip surgery.Thomas didn't disappoint.

At least, maybe you do when you’re Keith Tkachuk, and you’ve raised two true hockey ragamuffins in Brady Tkachuk and Matthew Tkachuk. Chances are, Keith’s probably more preoccupied with getting his sons not to obnoxiously dangle their mouthpieces out of their mouths.(And, yeah, maybe to make sure Matthew doesn’t get hosed on his second contract.)Anyway, Keith was on hand to see – and chuckle at – Brady, the younger of the two NHL Tkachuk kids, getting into a fight with Jonathan Ericsson of the Detroit Red Wings. It’s probably fair to say that Ericsson got the better of Brady, but judge for yourself in the video above this post’s headline, via Sportsnet.Judging by Hockey Fights’ listings, the family fight counts are now unofficially:Brady: Three. He’s a rookie, so he’s clearly endearing himself to opponents already.Matthew: Seven through three seasons.Keith: 51 fights during 1,201 regular-season and 89 playoff contests.Considering the temperaments of the Tkachuk brothers and father, chances are we’ll see more scuffles for both Brady and Matthew before they hopefully enjoy retirement as much as Keith seems to be enjoying it. And then there can be aggravating, skilled Tkachuk grandsons.—James O’Brien is a writer for Pro Hockey Talk on NBC Sports.

But in all seriousness, the jersey presents some interesting questions: Will it be easier for fans to “bandwagon”? Can players switch jerseys mid-game? Will Drake be first in line for this new prop?Meanwhile, Twitter had all of the jokes.Jersey cost only 20 easy installments of, $999.99.— Vod Kanockers (@JHoward2716) February 15, 2019Kevin Durant can now switch teams mid game with these new #NBA jerseys 😳 pic.twitter.com/a01rMkiexr— OT Sports Podcast Network (@OTSportsPod) February 15, 2019This could go one of two ways: Either the NBA will have found another way to separate itself from the other sports leagues or it will be a pointless feature that exists just because there is the technology to make it happen and for Twitter to crack jokes. In any case, you have to admit the NBA never fails to entertain.More from Yahoo Sports: • Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight When spring training camps opened this week around Major League Baseball, it brought hope that maybe, finally, Bryce Harper and Manny Machado would sign with teams and baseball’s long free-agent freeze would melt away.Nope. Not yet. Not only has that not happened, something else did happen: a number of talented young players around the league have agreed to team-friendly contract extensions.The latest was New York Yankees ace Luis Severino, who on Friday reportedly agreed to a four-year, $40 million deal. The deal, first reported by Joel Sherman of the New York Post, would buy up Severino’s arbitration years and comes with a $15 million club option for his first year of free agency.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]By agreeing to this deal, the Yankees and Severino avoid arbitration for 2019. He’ll make $4 million this season, $10 million next, then $10.25 million in 2021 and $11 million in 2022. The club option is for 2023. In the grand scheme of society, this is a very generous contract. In baseball’s economic bubble, it’s another young player signing for below-market value relative to his skills and potential.It’s hard to blame Severino for taking the deal, looking around at a free-agent world where Harper and Machado are still available, as are Dallas Keuchel and Craig Kimbrel. Especially since we haven’t heard even slight grumblings about teams being interested in Keuchel and Kimbrel.Coming off a breakout season in which he went 19-8 with a 3.39 ERA, the 25-year-old Severino was given a deal that’s pretty hard to turn down: “Do you want $40 million guaranteed, yes or no?”The other players faced with a similar question this week were Philadelphia Phillies ace Aaron Nola, who said yes to a four-year, $45 million deal Wednesday. It also avoided arbitration and bought out two of Nola’s free agency years, making it the most below-market deal of any of these.The Minnesota Twins locked up two of their talented young players Thursday, as right fielder Max Kepler agreed to a five-year, $35 million deal with a $10 million club option for 2024. It buys out three years of free agency for Kepler, 26. Shortstop Jorge Polanco also agreed to a five-year extension, his is worth $25.75 million with two option years that could keep him in Minnesota through 2025.In a vacuum, these types of extensions look like win-wins: The players get guaranteed money as they’re coming off good seasons. The clubs get cost-certainty to help them navigate the future — whether it’s the Yankees and Phillies trying to add big free agents this year or next, or a team like the Twins striving for contention with a homegrown core.In a bigger sense, though, it’s hard not to look at these deals in the current state of free agency and wonder if they’re a symptom of something else. Is it the market correcting itself? Is it baseball’s economy morphing into something new? Or maybe it’s just players looking around and saying, “Well, I better get my money now.”According to numerous reports, there’s a fear that for this generation of young players the light at the end of the tunnel — the big free-agency payday — won’t be there for them in the same way it was for so many other players.So while it’s great that stars like Justin Verlander, Clayton Kershaw and Max Scherzer are publicly speaking out about the current state of free agency, they’re on the right side of it. They got their mega deals.The younger players find themselves in a different sort of peril. It’s entirely possible that these are the biggest paydays these players ever get, which is a much different economic model that we’ve seen from baseball in the past.Whether it’s right or wrong — and that’s certainly something that’s up for debate heading into the next collective-bargaining agreement — baseball’s economy has often been backward. Players get paid less, relative to the market, in their pre-free agency years. The best recent example is Mike Trout winning the MVP in 2014 at age 22 while making $1 million.He got a raise to $6 million the next season, but in 2015 was still making a fraction of what people like Ryan Howard ($25M), Albert Pujols ($24M), Joe Mauer ($23M), Mark Teixeira ($22.5M) and Jose Reyes ($22M) were making.But that overpay is a necessary part baseball’s economic ecosystem too. It’s a fact: Players get overpaid as their careers decline. It’s almost like baseball’s way of making up for underpaying players during their early years. It’s baseball’s golden parachute. What’s happening these days is fewer teams are accepting that overpay as part of the how the system works.In the past few years, arbitration salaries have gotten higher and higher, and teams have tried harder to lock up younger stars before free agency. It’s why we’ve see players like Madison Bumgarner, Chris Archer, Chris Sale and Paul Goldschmidt become valuable trade chips for their team-friendly contract extensions.Teams are getting smarter about where their money goes, and how to keep value in their assets. These extensions to Severino, Nola and the rest show that they’re willing to spend money, just in the way that they want.Earlier this week, former Miami Marlins president David Samson tweeted something in response to Justin Verlander, saying the “broken system” talk was wrong. Players and their agents, Samson said, needed to adjust to a “new reality.”He may be right about the new reality part. The monster paydays at the end of the free agency tunnel could be fading away. If Bryce Harper and Manny Machado can’t get them, who can?The new reality could be players seizing their money. Whenever they can.– – – – – –Mike Oz is a writer at Yahoo Sports.

However, Wainwright framed the situation with a little more urgency on Friday by expressing concerns that a day of reckoning could happen sooner than later.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]Speaking to InsideSTL.com’s Tim McKernan, Wainwright said it was inevitable that the players will go on strike unless major changes are made to help bridge the widening gap. But he’s also worried that frustrations could reach a boiling point during the season leading to some form of a revolt. Perhaps even a mid-season walkout.#STLCards pitcher Adam Wainwright on @TMASTL: “Unless something changes, there’s going to be a strike. 100%. I’m just worried people are going to walk-out mid-season.” pic.twitter.com/M8WeRVcASe— Tim McKernan (@tmckernan) February 15, 2019“Unless something changes, there’s going to be a strike. 100%,” Wainwright said regarding the free-agent freeze that has left stars like Bryce Harper and Manny Machado without contracts. “I’m just worried people are going to walkout midseason.”It’s conceivable given the current climate, but a players revolt on that level still feels like a long shot. The target date we should all still be looking at is Dec. 1, 2021. That’s when the current collective bargaining agreement ends and the owners will be forced to come to the table.That doesn’t mean we should just dismiss Wainwright’s concerns about a 2019 strike. While they might feel a little on the dramatic side, the frustration that has built all offseason as dozens of free agents, including and especially Harper and Machado, remain unsigned is becoming more palpable by the day. There’s a genuine feeling that owners are determined to cut back on salaries even as profits continue to reach new heights, it’s possible the players’ patience will run out if the free-agent freeze continues to drag on. Wainwright thinks so, and he’s far from alone.In Friday’s interview, the 37-year-old right-hander also criticized owners and front offense personnel for placing too much emphasis on “analytics” and placing everything in a “sabermetric box” that discounts intangibles and other immeasurable aspects of baseball.Adam Wainwright said today on ⁦@TMASTL⁩ that he expects there to be a strike “100%.”The context of the conversation comes from a discussion on how Bryce Harper and Manny Machado are still without teams.You can see Wainwright’s reasoning in the video below. pic.twitter.com/GXsmx4cXk1— Tim McKernan (@tmckernan) February 15, 2019Wainwright admitted that there’s always risk in making long-term financial commitments to players, but emphasized that doing so marks a commitment to winning that several teams seemingly lack.“Part of it is smart from their side of it, but you have to realize it’s about winning. So, if Bryce Harper wants 10 years and he’s 26 years old. He’s going to be a dynamic player. The same can be said about Manny Machado. These guys are superstar players.”The deeper we get into it the more obvious it is that the players know what battles lie ahead. The only real question is how much worse it will get before any progress is made toward a satisfactory resolution.More from Yahoo Sports:• Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight MLB rumors: Bryce Harper has made his decision, says D.C. radio host originally appeared on nbcsportsbayarea.comA report has come out from the East Coast saying Bryce Harper has come to a decision on which team he will play for in 2019 and beyond.Chris Russell, a sports radio talk show host from 106.7 The Fan in Washington D.C., (who has been on the Harper beat for some time) said the free agent slugger could make a decision in the next 24 hours.\"Maybe I took a little bit of a leap of faith here based on some indications I got from a real good source,\" Russell told 94WIP, in Philadelphia, on Friday.\"Bryce and his representatives, (Scott) Boras, his people, his wife Kayla, they've been meeting since Monday morning in Vegas. Bryce originally wanted this done, when it took this long, by Valentine's Day. Obviously, the contract has not been announced, signed, or whatever.\"\"But I'm led to believe by the people that I've talked to that are close to the situation -- and I have, again, a real good source that has helped me through this process, let's just leave it at that,\" Russell said. \"That Bryce was in a mood to celebrate yesterday. Now, the source said, 'I believe it's done.' I don't have concrete, 100 percent proof for you guys. I wish I did, otherwise, I would have it and I would be running around with it. But I don't have that, so I want to caution everybody in Philadelphia. But that's what I was led to believe, that this thing is now decided.\"Russell then mentioned the Phillies.\"Now, what comes then is hammering out a contract. And if we were to believe the report that the Philadelphia Phillies had not even extended a formal offer -- and I assume that to be a termed, written agreement, that type of thing, which I find hard to believe -- then there might be more legwork to this. And therefore, hey the decision may be done, but the contract still needs to be ironed out.\"[RELATED: Phillies fan participates in \"lent\" in hopes of recruiting Harper]Russell is being safe with the terminology he's using, which is understandable. And while we haven't been able to confirm these rumors, Harper, along with many other free agents, remains unsigned.The Giants appeared to be the \"mystery team\" that introduced themselves late into the Harper sweepstakes -- and when the radio hosts asked Russell his opinion on where the outfielder will end up next season, he believed Harper will be in an orange and black uniform.\"I don't think it's going to be the Nationals,\" Russell said. \"I think it's going to be the San Francisco Giants, but that is not by any means an 'I know that for a fact,' so I want to caution everybody -- I know how this works -- I get in trouble with everything I say on my radio show, and everyone blows it up.\" The wait continues ... Golden State Warriors stars Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant empathised with Steve Kerr after the head coach was ejected during the loss to the Portland Trail Blazers having thrown a clipboard in response to a flagrant foul call.Kerr was enraged late in the fourth quarter when Draymond Green was called for a flagrant foul after he stopped Zach Collins from approaching the rim as he went up for a shot.That drew Kerr's ire and after ranting in one referee's face, he slammed a clipboard down to earn an ejection, with Durant having to escort his head coach back off the court.The Warriors lost the game 129-107 but will still head into the All-Star break with the best record in the Western Conference.\"It was an emotional game. We fought really hard for 43 minutes,\" Curry told reporters afterwards.\"One questionable decision - the flagrant - obviously the fire came out. You see coach go and throw a clipboard. At that point you try to get us over the hump. An eight-point swing, it's tough to overcome.\"\"I looked at the replay and the amount of ball [Green] got, there was nothing excessive about it, he got all the ball.\"There was a lot of chirping, with Zach involved. There was probably a sensitivity to it, trying to put out some fires, but I thought it was a terrible call. We obviously paid the price for it with how everything unfolded after that.\"Durant shared that sympathy having been the one to pull Kerr away from the referees as he continued to rant at them.\"I felt for him, I understand his anger and his rage, especially for that call,\" he said.\"I thought we should have just kept playing, It was a common foul, I thought. Refs looked at it differently. \"I understand why coach was a little frustrated.\"Kerr explained that it was the disbelief at the call that had triggered his reaction.\"I was just shocked that that was called a flagrant foul,\" he said. \"I'm not sure how it's determined - if it's in New York or the officials on the call - but that was head-scratching: that that could be called a flagrant foul.\"The guy's going to go in for a dunk, you've got to make sure he doesn't dunk it.\"So, I told Kenny [Mauer] that I beg to differ. There might have been a couple of other words in there too!\"I'll have to ask the owner if the clipboard broke when I threw it down. I got a little anger out so that was good. I was too busy yelling to ask for an explanation.\"Charles Barkley thinks New Orleans Pelicans star Anthony Davis made a mistake with his trade request.The 25-year-old asked the Pelicans to move him in late January and the Los Angeles Lakers had been engaged in discussions about acquiring him. But, no deal was reached before the deadline and Davis remained with New Orleans.Barkley, an 11-time All-Star who works as an analyst for TNT, said he thinks Davis and his agent, Rich Paul, mishandled the situation.\"Don't ruin your reputation as a great player, one of the nicest guys in the world,\" Barkley told reporters on Thursday ahead of All-Star weekend (via the Washington Post).\"Remember, your agent works for you, you don't work for him. They handled that situation wrong. It's going to come back to bite them in the a***. It's unfortunate.\"The six-time All-Star entered play on Thursday averaging 28.5 points and 13.1 rebounds this season. But, he scored just three points in 24 minutes on the floor in the Pelicans' 118-88 loss to the Orlando Magic earlier this week.\"This is a bad situation,\" Barkley said. \"It's a bad look for the NBA. Because that kid can't go out there and give 100 per cent because he’s worried about getting hurt. The guy's the second-best player in the world and he's got three points? That's not a good look for the NBA.\"The Boston Celtics and New York Knicks, among others, are expected to explore dealing for Davis after the season. Barkley, however, said he believes the forward will eventually land in Los Angeles because of Paul's relationship with Lakers star LeBron James.Barkley tallied 22.1 points and 11.7 rebounds per game over his 16-year career. He retired in 2000 and was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame six years later.After an apology from Sergio Garcia, a non-apology from Matt Kuchar, and an uncooperative Mother Nature on Valentine's Day, it's time for everyone to focus again on Tiger Woods. Kidding. Sort of. A weather-delayed first round at Riviera re-starts on Friday morning and the 14-time major champ will be in the Hollywood-area spotlight as he finally begins his Genesis Open. And golf fans could potentially see a LOT of the tournament host as the event tries to play catch up after heavy rains on Thursday.Woods, Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas (Decent group, eh?) are scheduled to tee off at 8:32 local time (11:32 ET). The hope is they will complete their first rounds and then play as much of their second rounds as possible before darkness. And Tiger's hope is to finally win for the first time at this historic layout where he missed the cut last year. We'll be tracking Tiger every step of the way so keep it right here for the latest scores, news and highlights. (All times eastern)SATURDAY, 11:25: With a 25-foot birdie putt on No. 9, Woods' final hole of the second round, Tiger will likely make the cut. The birdie brought Woods back to even on his round and to one under overall.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096808527694245890After resuming play in the morning, Woods bogeyed his first hole, No. 4, then made four pars before his finishing birdie. His playing partners, however, fared much better. Justin Thomas shares the lead with Adam Scott at 11 under and Rory McIlroy birdied four of his six holes on Saturday morning to shoot 63 and move to seven under through 36 holes. Thursday's early wave is now on the course for their second rounds.-------------------FRIDAY-------------------8:25: And with that, the horn has sounded—play will be suspended for darkness on Friday at Riviera. Tiger, JT and Rory have six more holes to complete their second round. Justin Thomas is at 10-under, tied with Adam Scott for the lead. Tiger will hope Saturday brings some different momentum for him—as this marathon day ends with two bogeys in a row after the highlight eagle.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10965708926692065298:21: That's back-to-back bogeys now for Tiger Woods, dropping another shot here at the third hole (his 12th of the round). And over his past six holes, Tiger has four bogeys. The birdie at No. 1 helped negate most of that damage ... but Tiger's back to 1-under again—right on the current cut line.8:13: On his 30th hole of the day, Tiger is showing some obvious signs of being tired. And who could blame him—he's been playing golf for nearly 10 hours straight. From 165 yards out at the third hole, Tiger Woods tries to chop out a 6-iron and comes out of it. His ball comes to rest short of the green. With sunset in Pacific Palisades being 5:30 local time, this group will have time for maybe one more hole today.8:04: Tiger follows up that eagle putt at No. 1 with a bogey at the second hole. The third bogey of his second round moves Tiger back to 2-under overall.7:56: After a long wait at the second hole, Tiger sprays his second shot from 235 out with a fairway wood out to the right. He'll have his work cut out from the front right bunker to save par at the 482-yard par 4.7:40: This is exactly what Tiger Woods needed: He rolls in his 43-foot eagle putt at his 10th hole (the first) to get back to 3-under—negating those two bogeys he made on his front nine. What a putt! With the flagstick in!https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096570892669206529Tiger made a disappointing par to open his first round earlier today at the first hole. The unlikely eagle makes up for that effort—and could turn around Tiger's second round in a dramatic way. Tiger goes from toeing the cut line at 1-under to now all of a sudden being T-21.7:28: Tiger finds the fairway at the par-5 first hole, the group's 10th hole of their second round, as he attempts to get a shot back here after bogeying two of his final three holes on his front nine. Neither bogey was particularly bad—the 18th hole is playing brutally tough right now uphill and into the wind with the rain, making it even more of a challenging hole. And his break at 16 was very unlucky.7:16: Tiger and JT are gonna have their work cut out to save par at the 18th hole (their ninth). Each player had fairway wood approaches and tried playing a big cut. JT was way up left on the hill—Tiger was closer. He went high with his approach and will have about 11 feet left for par.Tiger misses the par putt, so he'll drop a shot along with JT as they make the turn. Tiger moves back to 1-under after 27 holes. That's where the cut line currently is—so all of a sudden, Tiger must be concerned about making the cut.7:01: Following Justin Thomas throwing a dart at the 17th to about 3 feet, Tiger puts his wedge shot from under 100 yards to outside 20 feet, so he'll be disappointed with that effort. The birdie putt misses on the high side, and Tiger taps in for par to remain at 2-under. His playing partner and buddy Justin Thomas stays hot, rolling in a fourth straight birdie to get to 9-under—tied for the lead with Adam Scott. Really impressive golf here from JT.6:54: The rain is really coming down now as the players head to the 17th hole. Tiger finds the fairway at the par-5 17th hole, but it was a short one—he has 326 yards left. Most players have been laying up at this par 5 all day.6:43: From a brutal position up against the back lip of the bunker, Tiger hacks it out—and somehow keeps the ball on the green, albeit the back portion. His par attempt from 44 feet away here comes up three feet shy. Tiger makes his bogey to move back to 2-under.Meanwhile, Justin Thomas is officially on fire. He has another birdie after a fabulous tee shot at 16. It's now two Kentucky boys tied at the top: Justin Thomas and J.B. Holmes (-8).https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10965576791939317766:39: Tiger will have serious lie issues at the par-3 16th hole. His tee shot came to rest up against the back lip of the bunker. As Billy Kratzert just remarked on PGA Tour Live, Tiger will do well just to keep this ball on the green. Though he avoided dropping a shot on his last hole, there might be a bogey in his future here.6:35: A clutchhh par save by Tiger at the 15th hole makes up for his poor chip—and Tiger keeps the momentum going on his second round, as he stays 3-under for the tournament and 2-under on the round.Justin Thomas, also in Tiger's group, holed out from in front of the green for birdie at the 14th hole, and he makes a long birdie putt at 15 to get to 7-under—just one back of fellow Kentucky native J.B. Holmes.6:32: A poor chip shot from Tiger at the 15th hole leaves him about 13 feet away. He'll need to convert that putt to prevent dropping his first shot of his second round.6:24: Tiger finds another fairway here at Riviera, this one at the 15th hole. The guy is feeeling it with his driver. Almost on auto pilot. His approach from 190 out turns a little too much, finding the rough to the left of the green. He'll have to get up and down to avoid dropping one here.6:20: From 20 feet out, Tiger's birdie bid comes up shy—never really scaring the hole, despite getting a good look at the line from Rory's putt. Tiger taps in for par to remain at 3-under.The putter has been disappointing for Tiger all day: He had 34 putts in his first round, including four three-putts, just the third time in his career he's done that.6:13: Tiger puts his tee shot at the par-3 14th hole just inside Rory's ball—about 20 feet right of the hole. He'll get a little teach from Rory's putt, too, as Tiger continues to hit it well today.6:07: Tiger just misses the left-to-right curling bid for birdie, leaving himself with an easy par at 13. He stays 3-under for the tournament and -2 through four on his round.Tiger's playing partners are also playing well—Rory has three birdies in his first four holes to get to 2-under. Look out for Rory at rainy Riviera. And Justin Thomas, despite hitting his tee shot out of bounds at 13, got up and down from 160 yards to avoid dropping multiple shots. He's now 5-under after that bogey.6:02: Another grooved tee shot for Tiger Woods at the 13th hole puts him in good position. He turned over his tee shot—putting his draw in the middle of the fairway at the dogleg left. Tiger spins his approach back to about 15 feet, just off the green in the fringe. He'll have a chance to knock another one here and keep the momentum going.5:51: Bang! Tiger nails the 25-footer for birdie at the 12th hole to add a second birdie to his card through three holes. Realistically, too, it could be three straight birdies for Tiger. But the 14-time major champion is now 2-under through 3—T-3 for the tournament (T-19)—and carries some strong momentum on his side at the start of his second round ... as the rain is coming down at Riviera.5:46: Tiger hits his approach hole high—about 25 feet from 181 yards. He'll have another chance to add a birdie to his third round.Tiger's currently at 2-under, which puts him at T-29. The projected cut is at 1-under—so he's comfortably inside the number as of now. But there's a ton of golf to be played, obviously.5:41: Tiger finds the fairway with his driver at the par-4 12th hole. The 12th usually plays as one of the toughest holes at Riviera—we'll see if Tiger can take advantage of his position here in the fairway.5:33: An excellent fairway-wood second shot by Tiger put him right in front of the par-5 11th green in two. But a very poor approach putt for his third leaves him more than 10 feet away. His birdie try slides by for a very disappointing par being so close in 2. That should've been a golden opportunity to start his second round with two birdies—instead, Tiger stays at 2-under.5:12: Tiger goes high with his pitch—having to navigate around the front bunker, and plays it nicely—spinning it about 7 feet short of the hole. So Tiger will have a good look for an opening birdie to start his second round. Tiger converts the birdie putt to move to 2-under.5:02: Only a little more than a half hour after finishing his first round, Tiger Woods (-1) -- along with Justin Thomas (-5) and Rory McIlroy (+1) -- has teed off in his second round. The group started on the drivable 10th hole, and Tiger has driven his tee shot just off the green. He'll have a chance to put his pitch shot close to start his second round with a birdie.4:24: Tiger narrowly misses the birdie putt at the 18th hole, so he'll tap in for a par and an opening-round, one-under 70 at Riviera. Having three-putted for a fourth time on the 17th hole to drop a shot in disappointing fashion, Tiger will head to his second round a bit frustrated. But the four consecutive birdies showed him being able to score well at Riviera, where he has never won.Tiger, JT (who birdied 18 to finish at 5-under) and Rory will head right back for their second round in this marathon day for them.4:18: Tiger responds to that shocking three-putt with a perfect drive and a towering 6-iron on Riviera's famed 18th. Woods is in good shape to at least make par the difficult hole, but as we've seen all day, a two-putt is anything but automatic.Here's an unusual stat on Tiger three-putting four times this afternoon. He's making some history in a bad way...https://twitter.com/JustinRayGolf/status/10965196250582507574:06: So much for the momentum. . . After a decent approach shot that spins back to about 20 feet, Woods runs his birdie putt a couple feet by and. . . gulp. . . misses the comebacker from about two feet. Wow. That's four three-putts on the day as Tiger falls back to one under with one hole to play.3:57: Uh-oh, it's raining in southern California again. Meanwhile, Woods is plodding his way up the par-5 17th. After pulling his drive into the left rough and drawing a poor lie, Woods pushed his layup slightly into the first cut of the right rough. He'll have a some sort of wedge to a back-right hole location.3:50: Tiger's tee shot was tracking on the par-3 16th, but it comes up about 30 feet short. From there, he two-putts for par to remain at two under. Justin Thomas makes his 10-foot birdie effort to move to four under, while Rory McIlroy remains at one over. McIlroy hast two holes to avert his first over-par score of 2019.3:40: After another great drive and a solid approach, Woods races his birdie attempt nearly five feet past the hole. But he keeps the overall positive momentum going by converting the par putt to remain at two under. Tiger has three more holes to play. At least, before he gets a lunch break.3:24: BANG! There's the bounce back from Tiger. It just came one hole later. And from farther away as Woods drains his 12-footer for birdie on No. 14.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096507996031467520Woods is now back to two under, five shots behind Jordan Spieth, who has to be pleased to still be in front by two despite these soft conditions.3:17: Tiger hits a great shot on the difficult par-3 14th hole to about 15 feet. He'll have a good look at birdie coming up. In the meantime, here's a look at how the leader board stands with Jordan Spieth still leading the way.Jordan Spieth (-7) 2t. Tony Finau (-5) 2t. Patrick Rodgers (-5) 2t. Kramer Hickok (-5) 2t. Davis Love III (-5) 2t. Adam Scott (-5) 2t. J.B. Homes (-5)Click here for full scores.3:13: Woods stuck his approach to about four feet below the hole on No. 13. A bounce back birdie looked like a forgone conclusion until he pushed his effort. Woof. That's two three-putts and two short misses on the greens for Tiger today. He remains at one under. Meanwhile, Rory McIlroy, after getting to two under through eight, has fallen to one over after back-to-back bogeys. Justin Thomas, the third player in the group, continues to lead this trio at three under.3:05: After hitting fade after fade, Woods steps to the 13th tee and rips a draw around the corner, perfectly setting up his next shot. Good to see him working it both ways with ease.3:01: Tiger pushed his tee shot into the right rough, then hit a fantastic recovery shot from a thick lie onto the green. He had a long look at birdie that rolled about four feet past, leaving him with a tricky left-to-right par putt, which he missed. That's three three putts on the day for Woods, and he's still one under.2:39: Not the best chip from Woods, as he left himself about six feet for birdie, but he makes it anyway. Four straight for Tiger to get to two under for the day.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10964952191957975042:30: Woods rips a 3-wood from 269 to just in front of the green. Hate to jinx him, but there's no reason he shouldn't easily make his fourth straight birdie here (ducks).2:20: Three in a row for Woods as he rolls in another at No. 10 and moves to one under. If he finds the fairway again at the 11th, four in a row will be in his sights. Meanwhile, Rory makes his par to stay at one under and JT ends up holing his 10 footer for birdie to get to four under. Finally a little bit of JUICE from this threesome.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096489287753711616https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096489787672780800By the way, it looks like we know when they'll be heading back out for round two later today. Here's an update from the Tiger Tracker:https://twitter.com/GCTigerTracker/status/1096481806067523585That should give them enough time to get at least 11 or 12 holes in.At the 11th, Woods stripes another drive down the fairway. He's really starting to cook.2:12: Tiger's shot was a tad more difficult than we thought, as he had to avoid a bunker and take it up high to get it back to the pin. He was successful, sticking it to about three feet. Hell of a shot. Even better was Rory's shot, as he flopped it from a nice lie and got it to hang on just off the back of the green and stay out of the back bunker. Thomas, who had the easiest shot, put too much spin on his chip, leaving himself with about 10 feet for birdie.2:07: Finally, Tiger, Rory and JT hit their tee shots, and it looks like the ensuing entertainment will be well worth the wait. Tiger is in the collection area left of the green, where he has a straightforward chip that should set him up with a good chance to make birdie. Thomas is just in front of the green, and he'll have a great chance to make a birdie as well. Rory ... um ... not so much. He's in the rough with a greenside bunker in front of him and a pin he won't be able to get close to, and just holding the green would be a miracle.1:52: Woods drains his four-footer for bird and turns in even par 35. Real strong finish to his opening nine, and now it looks like he'll have a long wait at the 10th. DeChambeau, Kuchar and Rahm have still yet to hit their tee shots.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10964831254067896321:47: Tiger had just 122 left to the green and stuck one in there close. He has four feet left for birdie to turn in even par, which would be a small victory after that ugly three putt back at No. 7. Not to mention he'll have a prime opportunity to get into red figures at the driveable par-4 10th.1:41: Woods cranks another high fade right down the middle with the driver at No. 9. With the tees up today, he'll have a low iron in his hand for his approach.1:34: And he's on the board! Woods bounces back with a birdie putt from 15 feet, getting him back to one over. We'll see if that gets him going before making the turn.1:30: From 125 yards out, Woods hit a wedge and hated it from the second he made contact. While he did pull it, he's still hole high and inside 20 feet. Hideki Matsuyama-esque move from Tiger.1:24: Woods rips one right down the middle at the par-4 eighth. Should have a short iron in.1:15: Tiger's birdie putt was actually from just off the green on the fringe, and he rolled it by some four feet. Then, he missed the comebacker for par, dropping to two over on the day. Oof.1:09: Fairway and a green for Woods at the seventh. Good look at birdie coming up to get back to level par.12:58: Another hole, another par for Woods, who two-putted from 24 feet on the par-3 sixth. In the group up ahead, though, Jon Rahm is making a move at three under through six.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/109646557828021452912:47: Another meh hole for Tiger on No. 5, just missing the fairway with his tee shot, finding the front of the green with a so-so approach, and two-putting for another par from 43 feet. Woods remains at one over through five holes while his playing partners, McIlroy and Thomas, both remain at one under.12:42: As Matt Kuchar's ball is in the air on the par-3 sixth, a fan yells, \"Go low—just not with the gratuity!\" Despite Matt maintaining this is \"not a story,\" it is. And this won't be the last comment like this.12:29: Woods hit a nice shot to about 15 feet on the par-3 fourth, but ran his birdie effort by the hole. Still one over. Still no highlights. At least, from Tiger. Here was Spieth's closing birdie from about an hour ago, because there is not much else exciting going on right now.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/109644546143346688112:17: Another missed fairway and another short approach from Tiger on the par-4 third. Although, Woods found the putting surface, he was unable to two-putt from 63 feet, missing a seven-footer for par after badly misreading his first putt. That drops Tiger to one over through three holes. Not a lot of highlights so far. . .12:02: Tiger misses right off the tee on No. 2 then comes up short on another approach. But his pitch shot nearly goes down, leaving him with a tap-in par. Even par through two holes.11:49: After that perfect opening tee shot, Tiger hit a hideous approach with a 5-iron that came up way short in a fairway bunker. From there, he hit his third to 10 feet but missed the putt to walk away with a disappointing par. Both of Tiger's playing partners, McIlroy and Thomas, make birdie.11:38: Matt Kuchar just misses his eagle attempt from 25 feet on No. 1, but taps in for birdie. Kuchar has been in the news a lot this week over a caddie controversy dating back to his win at the Mayakoba Golf Classic. A controversy he didn't help with his comments on Wednesday. Is it possible some of those \"Kuuuuch\" shouts will turn to \"Mooooch\"? Kinda sounded like it on the first hole. . .11:34: Jordan Spieth is in with a seven-under-par 64 to take the early lead. Spieth needed only 21 putts during his bogey-free round. Of course, starting tournaments hasn't been a problem for Spieth of late. Finishing, however, has been a different story. Incredibly, Spieth is looking for his first win since the 2017 British Open and his first top 5 since last year's Masters.11:32: Woods smashes a driver off the first tee that finds the fairway. The opening par 5 at Riviera is essentially a long par 4 and one of the easiest holes on the PGA Tour all year so Tiger is thinking at least birdie after that tee shot.10:53: So far, so good on the Friday weather:https://twitter.com/GCTigerTracker/status/1096437235262533632And with lift, clean and place in play (for at least the first round), low scores are out there. Let's set the over/under on the Par-71 layout at 68.5.10:45: We are approximately 45 minutes away from Tiger's tee time and it's another major champ who is already off to a fantastic start. Jordan Spieth has the lead at six under through 15 holes. Spieth leads Patrick Rodgers by one and then there's a big group at four under, including Bill Haas, who is playing in the event a year after being involved in a car accident during last year's tournament that killed a friend he was staying with. Make sure you read Brian Wacker's piece from earlier in the week on how Haas is still trying to move on from that tragedy.10:35: As we move within an hour from Tiger teeing off, check out GOLFTV's latest behind-the-scenes video with Woods in which he says his bag has up to 16(!) golf gloves during rainy rounds and he explains why he doesn't like wearing rain jackets:https://twitter.com/GOLFTV/status/1096246456795697153\"Pops used to say, 'Once you're wet, you're wet.

Once he started running the front office, his blinking at Paul George on national TV contributed to the Lakers getting fined again for tampering. Johnson’s praise of Giannis Antetokounmpo drew yet another tampering fine.So, though he escaped punishment for his recent comments on 76ers guard Ben Simmons, Johnson refused to answer a question about Hornets guard Kemba Walker.Carolina Blitz:Asked Magic about Kemba and he said y’all aren’t going to catch him slipping anymore. pic.twitter.com/sQZtIWnQbn— Carolina Blitz (@KeepBlitzin) February 15, 2019Johnson:You know I can’t answer any questions about no players, because every time I do it, I get fined. But anybody else do it, they don’t get fined. So I’m going to stay away from that one.I don’t blame Johnson for feeling that way.Other teams’ owners, coaches and executives have repeatedly publicly discussed rival players without facing announced punishment.To be fair, the NBA doesn’t reveal every fine. Bucks owner Marc Lasry reportedly just got fined for tampering, but the league never announced it. But, at minimum, there’s an inconsistency with how the NBA exposes Johnson’s transgressions.Even NBA commissioner Adam Silver said last year there’s a spotlight on the Lakers due to prior tampering. That strikes me as unfair. The Lakers already paid for their prior violations and should now be held to the same standard as everyone else.And for what it’s worth, I wish that standard allowed an all-time great point guard like Johnson to publicly share his thoughts on Kemba Walker.Gareth Bale has landed himself in hot water after La Liga denounced the Real Madrid star for his celebration in the Madrid derby, which could carry a ban of four to 12 games.The Welsh forward scored as a substitute in the 3-1 victory over Atletico Madrid, bringing up his 100th goal for the club.And during the celebrations that followed, Bale \"lifted his right arm near his head in a clear sign of provocation towards the fans, then giving a gesture which could be seen as obscene and disdainful by folding his arm and striking it with his other hand.\"In a statement released by La Liga, Bale’s punishment will be decided by whether he incited the crowd or not.If Bale is guilty of “inciting opposition fans” to cause a hostile reaction, the punishment could carry four to 12 games, if there was no hostile reaction but intent, then it could be as little as one to three games.The gesture is referred to in Spain as ‘corte de mangas,’ with the moment not picked up in the referee’s match report.A committee will now decide whether the gesture merits a punishment.Bale also featured in Real’s Champions League victory over Ajax.Los Blancos take a 2-1 lead back to the Bernabeu for the second leg of the last 16 tie after Marco Asensio’s late winner.Earlier this week Heisman Trophy winner — and first round draft pick of the Oakland Athletics — Kyler Murray chose football over baseball, committing himself to the NFL draft.

In the last month alone he's won his 44th PGA Tour event, finished second in another, hit every fairway in a round for the first time in 21 years, shot a 60, pulled off this impossible recovery shot, gone viral just by rolling his eyes and said he might drop the Players from his schedule because he's already won it (a literal mic drop). The man simply cannot be stopped right now.Leave it to the weather to literally rain on Lefty's parade. On Thursday at the Genesis Open, Mickelson began his first round at the difficult short par-4 10th and drove into one of the bunkers up near the green, leaving him with a dreaded lengthy sand shot. He wound up hitting it over the green, and his ball plugged in the back bunker, setting up an even harder shot than he just had. As you'll hear PGA Tour Live commentator Shane Bacon say, avoiding making a six was probably the goal, but after Mickelson hit his third into another bunker on the other side of the green, a six suddenly became best-case scenario. How does a four sound instead?https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096076528142626818Find us a more Phil Mickelson par ever... you can't. He's always got a flair for the dramatic. The problem?

(Old man golfers)The dust is barely settled in the wake of the end of the Markelle Fultz era in Philadelphia, and the former 76ers guard is already taking shots at his old team.His old coach Brett Brown in particular.Fultz had his introductory press conference with the Orlando Magic on Thursday after being traded at last week’s deadline and praised his new coach Steve Clifford while taking a veiled shot at Brown.“It just excites me to know that I have a coach that’s going to push you to be better and not just going to tell you what you want to hear,” Fultz said.That’s direct praise for his new coach. But the message for Brown is clear. Fultz didn’t like what he heard from the Philadelphia coaching staff.Fultz never had any public dispute with the 76ers, but it was evident that he and the team had different approaches to the struggles that saw him shoot 41.4 percent from the field, 26.7 percent from 3-point distance and 53.4 percent from the line in limited action after being selected as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2017 draft.It’s still not clear whether injury or a mental block – or both – are the cause of his shooting issues.After his agent announced that the nerve disorder thoracic outlet syndrome was the root of the shooting woes, Fultz never played again for the 76ers.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]Fultz appears to be fully embracing the fresh start in Orlando as a player and a person.“I think the biggest thing we talked about what doing thing the right way,” Fultz said. “Just building me up both as a man and on the court. I think that’s music to my ears, really just. Two things I really want to do is be the best player I can be and be the best young man I can be.”Fultz described the experience of his nerve disorder to reporters.“It’s hard to lift up your arms, you lose feeling in your fingers,” Fultz said. “You can’t tell when it’s going to happen. It’s not like you do the same motion every time. You get tingling in your fingers, numbness. Stuff like that.”He also curtly dismissed any notion that his shooting struggles are due to anything but injury.“I had an injury,” Fultz said. “I was out there trying to play through that. I never lost confidence.”Asked about a timetable to return, Fultz dodged the question to talk about rehab.“Right now it’s just about getting everything the right way,” he said. “Rehab’s been going great. I’m just taking my time and doing everything the right way.”More from Yahoo Sports: • PGA Tour pro defends paying caddie $5K on $1.3M win • NFL bars NCAA’s all-time sack leader from combine • Only one NBA team failed to scout Antetokounmpo • Black History honor for Kaepernick sacked by lawmakers He might not be well known to NFL fans at large, but New England Patriots fans know linebacker Kyle Van Noy — acquired basically for free from the Detroit Lions at the 2016 trade deadline — has been a big part of the defense the last two years, and has a knack for making plays at the right time.Van Noy is getting a little shine after winning his second Super Bowl ring with New England, appearing on the “Pardon My Take” podcast on Thursday to dish on all things Patriots and Super Bowl LIII.One thing that Van Noy revealed: the Los Angeles Rams didn’t do anything surprising during the game on offense.“I couldn’t believe that,” Van Noy said. “They really didn’t do — not one wrinkle. I was like, ‘What the hell?’ They’ve got so many good players, they’ve got so many things they’ve done all year, and the one play they gave us which was a wrinkle was the [Brandin] Cooks screen that hit for a little bit.“And that was it… Or maybe too, we were playing so good they were like, ‘[Expletive], we don’t know what to do.’ ”Hindsight, of course, is 20-20, but given that the Patriots’ coaching staff is known for having its players prepared for any and everything, it seems unwise that Los Angeles didn’t add some new plays or looks to try to stump New England.Van Noy said the Patriots’ culture, specifically coach Bill Belichick’s practice of not sparing anyone in the film room, even Tom Brady, is part of why the team continues to win.“Oh yeah. Yeah, that [stuff is] sick, to be honest, because it sets the table,” Van Noy said. “Like, OK, it doesn’t matter who you are, everyone’s on an even playing field. This is how it is here at work. You come in and you earn everything.“And I respect that because I felt like that gave me a chance to get on the field when I came in mid-year, and [Belichick] was like, ‘It doesn’t matter who you are or what you’ve done. You earn your keep.’ ”More from Yahoo Sports: • Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight The Brady Conundrum: How do you go about replacing the GOAT? originally appeared on nbcsportsboston.comThe Patriots hatched a Tom Brady succession plan after the 2013 season when they drafted Jimmy Garoppolo.Brady blew that up.Now, five years, four Super Bowl appearances, three Super Bowl wins, two Super Bowl MVPs and a regular-season MVP later, it's time to gingerly -- caaaauuuuuutiooooousssssllllyyyyy -- begin the process again.This time should be different.Even though Brady's contract hasn't been extended past the 2019 season, the love and happiness we saw on the field after the Rams were dispatched in SB53 is a good sign.MORE PATRIOTSAreas of Change: Will Pats be able to retain free agents Trey Flowers and Trent Brown?Brady's wariness about the Patriots' plans for him, and Bill Belichick's wariness about wedding his team to a quarterback who's closer to 50 years old than he is to 30, has dissipated.Once a new deal is in place -- Jonathan Kraft indicated that might be before training camp, though as of the Super Bowl conversations hadn't started -- Brady will have a written assurance that he will leave the Patriots and the NFL on his terms.That wasn't the case in early 2014 when the soon-to-be-37-year-old Brady saw the Patriots spend a first-round pick on a defensive tackle (Dominique Easley) and their second-rounder on Garoppolo. That, after a '13 season Brady spent throwing to the likes of Aaron Dobson, Josh Boyce, Kenbrell Thompkins and Austin Collie.Garoppolo was a stick of dynamite under Brady's behind. He was the existential threat Brady feared made flesh.Jimmy might have thought he was drafted to learn how to play quarterback in the NFL and have a nice career. To Brady, Garoppolo was there to take his job, throw his career into upheaval, uproot his family and see Brady cast out into the NFL wilderness.MORE PATRIOTSPerry: If Beckham is on the trade block, should Patriots be willing to pay the price?And, in contrast to the guy Brady succeeded in 2001 (and, by extension, did all those things to), Brady wasn't going to snort derisively at the plucky little draft pick here to take his job. He would crush the threat.He did.Brady played so well that -- despite Garoppolo developing into a bona-fide front-line quarterback under Belichick and Josh McDaniels (and Brady) -- Brady left the ever-prepared Patriots with no recourse when Garoppolo's contract was about to expire.Brady was too good to bench and too important to trade. Garoppolo was too expensive to franchise and too smart to take a \"bridge\" contract so he could watch Brady from the sidelines while his own hair started to gray at the temples. So off he went around Halloween, 2017.A lot's happened in the 16 months since.MORE PATRIOTSPhil Perry's Mock Draft 1.0: Pats start looking for Gronk's replacementBut now here we are, in the offseason of Brady's 42nd year. And the complex question of how to find the player who will eventually replace the greatest quarterback in NFL history still lingers.Do you draft his successor? If you do, do you do it this year? Do you do it next year?Do you try to get into the top 10 to get your pick of the litter? Do you stay put, confident that the muttonheads across the league will miss out as they did with Brady and Garoppolo (or Aaron Rodgers, Russell Wilson, Drew Brees, Brett Favre, Johnny Unitas . . . you get the point)? How much will it cost to get into the top 10? Do you package picks from this season -- when you will have six in the first three rounds -- and pick a sucker who will suck next year and fleece them for their 2020 first-rounder? How high do you have to go for a blue-chip, given the number of first-round quarterbacks that will be taken this year and that were taken in 2018?Is it a trade for somebody another team's given up on or has no work for, like San Francisco's Nick Mullens? A veteran who will hit free agency like Nick Foles, Case Keenum or Teddy Bridgewater?How does the successor play the position? Similar to Brady in that brain/eyes/accuracy/commitment trumps legs/arm strength/versatility?MORE PATRIOTSShould Pats be interested in Demaryius Thomas? No . . . and yesOr is there an embrace of the fact that trying to find a quarterback similar to a guy who came into the league after four years at Michigan at the end of last century with a once-in-a-lifetime work ethic is a pipe dream?Aside from who the successor is and how he plays, can Brady -- the lion in winter -- be tapped to help groom whoever is being brought aboard to take over?Brady -- contrary to sexed-up speculation -- didn't actively undermine Garoppolo at any point. They were teammates. He helped Garoppolo play the position better. They became close. But he wasn't quite showing him his world, either. Brady is famous for saying he's not giving away his secrets to younger quarterbacks until after he's done.With the end-date likely to be agreed upon when he signs an extension, does he become more a mentor so that the success of the franchise has a better chance to continue after he leaves? Would the Patriots want him to do that?Or would they want a blank(ish) slate to work with that isn't saying, \"But Tom said . . . \" when they try to shape him to succeed?And that contract? What's it look like? Does Brady demand pay commensurate with what he's accomplished? Is he in the mood to do the team another financial solid given the only bump they have him in 2018 was incentives he never reached? How does that impact the structure of the team?These questions aren't new. What is new is the level of angst and anxiousness. It's dissipated tremendously.That won't make finding his replacement or choosing the means by which the Patriots will do it any easier. But it's less fraught now.The irony is, the Patriots already successfully found Brady's successor.

Witten said this week that he believes Moore will be innovative and that the offense will take a “big step” by gearing things around quarterback Dak Prescott.“Yeah, I think he will do the things that Dak likes to do,” Witten said, via the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. “He will do the things they have to do to win. That is the way they have to play. I think they will use the pass to set up the run. Not just the run to set up the pass. I think he will add some nice wrinkles to that offense.”With head coach Jason Garrett coaching in the final year of his contract, Moore’s work with the offense will have a lot to do with how Dallas does in 2019 and with the path the team charts in the years that follow. If Witten’s correct, that path will probably look a lot like the one they’ve been on for a while.The story of Danny Ainge's Greece visit to watch Giannis Antetokounmpo is a wild one originally appeared on nbcsportsboston.comThe Boston Celtics took an early interest in Greece basketball star Giannis Antetokounmpo before he was selected in the 2013 NBA Draft.C's president of basketball operations Danny Ainge actually went over to Europe to watch Antetokounmpo play, and the postgame scene was nothing short of crazy.Fans were going wild, and some of them even yelled at Ainge because they thought he was associated with Antetokounmpo's team -- Ainge was sitting near its bench during the game.Check out the video below to hear the wild story of Ainge's scouting visit to Greece:Time for another \"Finding Giannis\" outtake. The first NBA team to scout Giannis was the Boston Celtics. As is often the case in Greece, hilarity ensued, as told by @GrgpanouOCT about Danny Ainge's visit. #FindingGiannis will be broadcasted Saturday on TNT at 630pm EST. pic.twitter.com/8bLjIjHv77— Jonathan Givony (@DraftExpress) February 14, 2019The Celtics liked what they saw from Antetokounmpo, but they decided to take Gonzaga forward/center Kelly Olynyk with their 2013 first-round pick instead. The C's made a trade with the Dallas Mavericks (who owned the No. 13 pick) to select Olynyk, whose ability to handle the ball and shoot well from the outside as a big man was appealing.Antetokounmpo ultimately was taken by the Milwaukee Bucks with the 15th pick. The \"Greek Freak\" has since become one of the league's best players and arguably is the leading candidate for MVP this season. It's still hard to fault Ainge and other executives for passing on Antetokounmpo, though. He was a very raw talent, and other players in that draft class were expected to provide more immediate contributions.Click here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!

They run the same plays over and over again. All they do is flop and shoot free throws. Maybe they’re even ruining basketball. Who isn’t these days, right?Houston’s offense operates with rigid discipline. The Rockets run and run James Harden off screens until he finds a tenable matchup to exploit. Tenable, so we’re clear, is a loosely defined term for a player who only needs a sliver of space to shoot from anywhere on the floor, whose combined ball-handling and strength psychs out defenders and referees alike.It is repetitive, sure, but in a way that’s endlessly fascinating. The Rockets repeatedly put the ball in the hands of the one of the NBA’s most creative, destructive scorers and wait for him to find a sieve — or create one. Harden now holds the second-longest 30-point scoring streak in NBA history, breaking 31 games in Wednesday night’s loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves, and he’s averaging a league-scorching 36.5 points per game.I’d argue all that makes the Rockets more watchable than most teams, which dilly-dally for possessions at a time, only looking to optimize in the face of urgency. You won’t find any freewheeling action from Iguodala-types in Houston. Even Austin Rivers has (mostly) held himself in check. Every time I turn on a Rockets game, Harden or Chris Paul has possession of the ball and is on the cusp of doing something. The game becomes a successive highlight reel that doesn’t allow you to turn the dial.The same quality that makes the Rockets so entertaining right now — and will likely garner Harden a second MVP — might be what hurts them in the playoffs again. The fuse is burning bright: Harden holds the ball an average of 9.6 seconds when he touches it, the highest mark in the NBA. His usage rate is 39 percent, smashing second place by 7 percent. What Harden’s doing might not be the best idea for the Rockets’ future outlook.But it’s definitely not boring. Even on defense, an opponent can make a name for himself with a signature moment against Harden — just ask Josh Okogie.As for as Harden’s high free-throw attempts bogging the game down, I won’t be convinced that a generation that cuts away to their iPhone screen 50 times per day is that bothered by an opportunity to look away from the action. When Harden’s playing, it’s the only chance you’re going to get.Because it seems like it, at least in the East. For the past few weeks, the dominant Warriors storyline has been about how Kevin Durant’s impending free agency could impact their title run. After a win against the Utah Jazz two nights ago, Durant said he feels the team is not playing well. These are the same Warriors, mind you, who are 16-3 since the New Year. Not only have they won all 11 games DeMarcus Cousins has played in — they’ve blown the tops off buildings, outscoring opponents by 9.7 points per 100 possessions. Until July 1, Warriors inevitability reigns.Why is it, then, that the Eastern Conference is littered with high-end teams that made big bets on winning this year? The Boston Celtics made their bed a while ago, with Kyrie Irving’s contract expiring when the season ends. The Toronto Raptors traded franchise cornerstone DeMar DeRozan for a chance to woo Kawhi Leonard for a season. Then they doubled down by trading for Marc Gasol. In sum, the 76ers exchanged Jerryd Bayless, Robert Covington, Dario Saric, Wilson Chandler, Mike Muscala, Landry Shamet, two first-round picks and two second-round picks for Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris, a pair of stars with deals that expire at the end of the year.(Side note: At least one of these three teams has to flame out in the second round. And then what does it do? For once, the playoff drama will be in the East, if not the title.)Could it be possible that the Warriors are so dominant that they’ve convinced the rest of the NBA to change the goalposts of ultimate success? Because as it stands right now, we’ve got a set of teams that went all in on trying to get to second place. It feels more like they’re auditioning for a post-Warriors future than trying to succeed in the current landscape. Even in a world where success is narrowly defined by wins and losses, perception is everything. And some things are inherent: If the rest of the NBA can’t compete against the Warriors, they still can’t help but compete against themselves.The aftermath of the most emboldened trade request in recent NBA history has been ugly. Anthony Davis is not a Laker — or a Knick or a Celtic or a Buck for that matter. And the New Orleans Pelicans don’t seem to have much use for him either. They’d rather sit him and pile up losses, focus on the lottery race and protect Davis’ health so they can trade him in the offseason. But the NBA issued a directive: The Pelicans would be fined $100,000 for every game he sat.So it is that after playing well enough to keep the Pelicans in it, Davis was benched in the fourth quarter two games in a row. Then, against the Orlando Magic, they got blown out by 30 points, which led to Davis — chef’s kiss — criticizing the team’s effort. So things aren’t good. What’s worse: It doesn’t seem like they’re going to get any better.Thanks to the NBA’s orders, this is the only reasonable compromise for both the Pelicans and Davis. He gets to pervert his livelihood — surely important to a man who has spent so many days involuntarily sidelined by injuries — while the Pelicans at least get to lose some of the time.Here’s what it comes down to: The NBA can’t make a decision that weighs the Pelicans real interests, because it can’t be so blithely rational about what’s best for them, which is tanking. In an alternate universe with no draft lottery, the Pelicans might at least be incentivized to let Davis play when it matters to get fans in seats. But the league won’t acknowledge its worst kept secret, so a dysfunctional situation is primed to only get worse.Nothing like the 76ers to get the Boston Celtics going. And nothing like a loss to the Celtics on Tuesday night to spread anxiety in the lives of 76ers fans.Despite the addition of Tobias Harris, the 76ers lost to the Kyrie-less Celtics in the same ways they’ve habitually lost to them: The Celtics stuck like glue to the few shooters the 76ers play at the same time and treated Ben Simmons like a non-entity, while Al Horford ate Joel Embiid’s lunch. The Sixers couldn’t protect the perimeter on the other end, so they never got much of a chance to get out in transition.I won’t write them off as quickly as I did after Christmas, if only because Harris is the type of sharpshooter who could tip the scales in favor of an old-school style — if they’re willing to embrace it.Since trading for Jimmy Butler in November, the Sixers are seventh in pace, 11th in defense and 16th in offensive rebounding. This is a team with three starters who are above 6-foot-8, including the league’s most imposing center since Shaq, but it’s stuck in the middle because it’s trying to fit old-school parts into a new-school game. The league has been crashing full-tilt into more space and pace for years, so you can forgive the Sixers for trying, but you don’t win championships by playing against your strengths.Philadelphia should be slow, plodding, muscly and mean. It should crash the glass with impunity, hunt cross-matches with pick-and-rolls and bully defenders in the post. The mere idea of entering the paint against the 76ers should make opponents cower with fear.The only rub is that slowing it down doesn’t serve Ben Simmons’ style, but they’re going to have to figure out the inevitable tension between his transition-happy game and Embiid’s half-court dominance eventually. Better to do it while playing to your strengths and find out if it works now, instead of two years down the road.Following Jeremy Lin’s first game as a Raptor, he took to the podium and shared some interesting thoughts on the presence of the international media. Here are some snippets, from the Toronto Star:“Yeah, [Mandarin media] probably happens in every city that has a strong Asian contingent,” Lin said. “Happened in Atlanta as well, but not this. So again, I’m very proud to represent Asian people on a global platform, on a global scale. And for me to be here where there’s a lot of Asians, like, I used to run from it, you know?“Because that’s all anybody’s ever wanted to look for. Like, ‘Oh, he’s Asian, he’s Asian, he’s Asian.’ And I was like, talk about my basketball. But now people can see I can play, I belong in the NBA, and I’ve really embraced just being able to represent Asians and do it the right way, hopefully.“Yeah, I mean, I think I was really jaded after the New York stretch,” Lin continued. “I think there was a lot of things that happened that made me give up a little bit on people, per se. And that was a huge part of the story, and that was a huge point of contention for a lot of people as to why I was getting the publicity, or why things were the way they were.“So I kind of wanted to run from that a little bit. I would probably say three years down the road, I kind of turned a corner, and I would say being hurt for two straight years, and seeing that my Asian fan base, I don’t feel like it dropped off one bit. And I haven’t even touched the court. Like, every year I go over to Asia and I can’t even walk through the airport — it’s insane. So to see them do that after all the highs and lows, but really going through the lows post-Linsanity, which culminated in those injuries, for me, I’m still blown away. And again, that’s fed into why I want to carry myself a certain way.”I don’t have a lot to say here, except that it’s touching to see a man whose identity was leveraged and controlled by outside forces for so long get to stop running away from how he’s perceived and finally be himself: an NBA player who once turned the basketball universe on its head, an Asian-American, a God-fearing Harvard grad. He has lived long enough in the public eye that the public has finally accepted what they originally thought were contradictory traits. That, friends, is how stereotypes are broken.More from Yahoo Sports:• PGA Tour pro defends paying caddie $5K on $1.3M win • NFL bars NCAA’s all-time sack leader from combine • Only one NBA team failed to scout Antetokounmpo • Black History honor for Kaepernick sacked by lawmakers Isaiah Thomas gets standing ovation, drills 3-pointer in Nuggets debut originally appeared on nbcsportsboston.comBrad Stevens could have begun his All-Star vacation Wednesday night after the Boston Celtics defeated the Detroit Pistons.But Stevens had a Denver Nuggets game to catch.The Celtics head coach set his DVR for Nuggets-Sacramento Kings to watch his former star player, Isaiah Thomas, make his Denver debut after a lengthy absence caused by offseason hip surgery.Thomas didn't disappoint.

At least, maybe you do when you’re Keith Tkachuk, and you’ve raised two true hockey ragamuffins in Brady Tkachuk and Matthew Tkachuk. Chances are, Keith’s probably more preoccupied with getting his sons not to obnoxiously dangle their mouthpieces out of their mouths.(And, yeah, maybe to make sure Matthew doesn’t get hosed on his second contract.)Anyway, Keith was on hand to see – and chuckle at – Brady, the younger of the two NHL Tkachuk kids, getting into a fight with Jonathan Ericsson of the Detroit Red Wings. It’s probably fair to say that Ericsson got the better of Brady, but judge for yourself in the video above this post’s headline, via Sportsnet.Judging by Hockey Fights’ listings, the family fight counts are now unofficially:Brady: Three. He’s a rookie, so he’s clearly endearing himself to opponents already.Matthew: Seven through three seasons.Keith: 51 fights during 1,201 regular-season and 89 playoff contests.Considering the temperaments of the Tkachuk brothers and father, chances are we’ll see more scuffles for both Brady and Matthew before they hopefully enjoy retirement as much as Keith seems to be enjoying it.

In any case, you have to admit the NBA never fails to entertain.More from Yahoo Sports: • Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight When spring training camps opened this week around Major League Baseball, it brought hope that maybe, finally, Bryce Harper and Manny Machado would sign with teams and baseball’s long free-agent freeze would melt away.Nope. Not yet. Not only has that not happened, something else did happen: a number of talented young players around the league have agreed to team-friendly contract extensions.The latest was New York Yankees ace Luis Severino, who on Friday reportedly agreed to a four-year, $40 million deal. The deal, first reported by Joel Sherman of the New York Post, would buy up Severino’s arbitration years and comes with a $15 million club option for his first year of free agency.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]By agreeing to this deal, the Yankees and Severino avoid arbitration for 2019. He’ll make $4 million this season, $10 million next, then $10.25 million in 2021 and $11 million in 2022. The club option is for 2023. In the grand scheme of society, this is a very generous contract. In baseball’s economic bubble, it’s another young player signing for below-market value relative to his skills and potential.It’s hard to blame Severino for taking the deal, looking around at a free-agent world where Harper and Machado are still available, as are Dallas Keuchel and Craig Kimbrel. Especially since we haven’t heard even slight grumblings about teams being interested in Keuchel and Kimbrel.Coming off a breakout season in which he went 19-8 with a 3.39 ERA, the 25-year-old Severino was given a deal that’s pretty hard to turn down: “Do you want $40 million guaranteed, yes or no?”The other players faced with a similar question this week were Philadelphia Phillies ace Aaron Nola, who said yes to a four-year, $45 million deal Wednesday. It also avoided arbitration and bought out two of Nola’s free agency years, making it the most below-market deal of any of these.The Minnesota Twins locked up two of their talented young players Thursday, as right fielder Max Kepler agreed to a five-year, $35 million deal with a $10 million club option for 2024. It buys out three years of free agency for Kepler, 26. Shortstop Jorge Polanco also agreed to a five-year extension, his is worth $25.75 million with two option years that could keep him in Minnesota through 2025.In a vacuum, these types of extensions look like win-wins: The players get guaranteed money as they’re coming off good seasons. The clubs get cost-certainty to help them navigate the future — whether it’s the Yankees and Phillies trying to add big free agents this year or next, or a team like the Twins striving for contention with a homegrown core.In a bigger sense, though, it’s hard not to look at these deals in the current state of free agency and wonder if they’re a symptom of something else. Is it the market correcting itself? Is it baseball’s economy morphing into something new? Or maybe it’s just players looking around and saying, “Well, I better get my money now.”According to numerous reports, there’s a fear that for this generation of young players the light at the end of the tunnel — the big free-agency payday — won’t be there for them in the same way it was for so many other players.So while it’s great that stars like Justin Verlander, Clayton Kershaw and Max Scherzer are publicly speaking out about the current state of free agency, they’re on the right side of it. They got their mega deals.The younger players find themselves in a different sort of peril. It’s entirely possible that these are the biggest paydays these players ever get, which is a much different economic model that we’ve seen from baseball in the past.Whether it’s right or wrong — and that’s certainly something that’s up for debate heading into the next collective-bargaining agreement — baseball’s economy has often been backward. Players get paid less, relative to the market, in their pre-free agency years. The best recent example is Mike Trout winning the MVP in 2014 at age 22 while making $1 million.He got a raise to $6 million the next season, but in 2015 was still making a fraction of what people like Ryan Howard ($25M), Albert Pujols ($24M), Joe Mauer ($23M), Mark Teixeira ($22.5M) and Jose Reyes ($22M) were making.But that overpay is a necessary part baseball’s economic ecosystem too. It’s a fact: Players get overpaid as their careers decline. It’s almost like baseball’s way of making up for underpaying players during their early years. It’s baseball’s golden parachute. What’s happening these days is fewer teams are accepting that overpay as part of the how the system works.In the past few years, arbitration salaries have gotten higher and higher, and teams have tried harder to lock up younger stars before free agency. It’s why we’ve see players like Madison Bumgarner, Chris Archer, Chris Sale and Paul Goldschmidt become valuable trade chips for their team-friendly contract extensions.Teams are getting smarter about where their money goes, and how to keep value in their assets. These extensions to Severino, Nola and the rest show that they’re willing to spend money, just in the way that they want.Earlier this week, former Miami Marlins president David Samson tweeted something in response to Justin Verlander, saying the “broken system” talk was wrong. Players and their agents, Samson said, needed to adjust to a “new reality.”He may be right about the new reality part. The monster paydays at the end of the free agency tunnel could be fading away. If Bryce Harper and Manny Machado can’t get them, who can?The new reality could be players seizing their money. Whenever they can.– – – – – –Mike Oz is a writer at Yahoo Sports.

Follow @MikeOzMore from Yahoo Sports:• Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlightSt. Louis Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright became the latest player to forecast a “doom and gloom” outlook for Major League Baseball based on the growing financial and philosophical disconnect between the players and the owners.The sentiment that a strike will happen is one we’ve become accustomed to hearing from the players. However, Wainwright framed the situation with a little more urgency on Friday by expressing concerns that a day of reckoning could happen sooner than later.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]Speaking to InsideSTL.com’s Tim McKernan, Wainwright said it was inevitable that the players will go on strike unless major changes are made to help bridge the widening gap. But he’s also worried that frustrations could reach a boiling point during the season leading to some form of a revolt. Perhaps even a mid-season walkout.#STLCards pitcher Adam Wainwright on @TMASTL: “Unless something changes, there’s going to be a strike. 100%. I’m just worried people are going to walk-out mid-season.” pic.twitter.com/M8WeRVcASe— Tim McKernan (@tmckernan) February 15, 2019“Unless something changes, there’s going to be a strike. 100%,” Wainwright said regarding the free-agent freeze that has left stars like Bryce Harper and Manny Machado without contracts. “I’m just worried people are going to walkout midseason.”It’s conceivable given the current climate, but a players revolt on that level still feels like a long shot. The target date we should all still be looking at is Dec. 1, 2021. That’s when the current collective bargaining agreement ends and the owners will be forced to come to the table.That doesn’t mean we should just dismiss Wainwright’s concerns about a 2019 strike. While they might feel a little on the dramatic side, the frustration that has built all offseason as dozens of free agents, including and especially Harper and Machado, remain unsigned is becoming more palpable by the day. There’s a genuine feeling that owners are determined to cut back on salaries even as profits continue to reach new heights, it’s possible the players’ patience will run out if the free-agent freeze continues to drag on. Wainwright thinks so, and he’s far from alone.In Friday’s interview, the 37-year-old right-hander also criticized owners and front offense personnel for placing too much emphasis on “analytics” and placing everything in a “sabermetric box” that discounts intangibles and other immeasurable aspects of baseball.Adam Wainwright said today on ⁦@TMASTL⁩ that he expects there to be a strike “100%.”The context of the conversation comes from a discussion on how Bryce Harper and Manny Machado are still without teams.You can see Wainwright’s reasoning in the video below. pic.twitter.com/GXsmx4cXk1— Tim McKernan (@tmckernan) February 15, 2019Wainwright admitted that there’s always risk in making long-term financial commitments to players, but emphasized that doing so marks a commitment to winning that several teams seemingly lack.“Part of it is smart from their side of it, but you have to realize it’s about winning. So, if Bryce Harper wants 10 years and he’s 26 years old. He’s going to be a dynamic player. The same can be said about Manny Machado. These guys are superstar players.”The deeper we get into it the more obvious it is that the players know what battles lie ahead. The only real question is how much worse it will get before any progress is made toward a satisfactory resolution.More from Yahoo Sports:• Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight MLB rumors: Bryce Harper has made his decision, says D.C. radio host originally appeared on nbcsportsbayarea.comA report has come out from the East Coast saying Bryce Harper has come to a decision on which team he will play for in 2019 and beyond.Chris Russell, a sports radio talk show host from 106.7 The Fan in Washington D.C., (who has been on the Harper beat for some time) said the free agent slugger could make a decision in the next 24 hours.\"Maybe I took a little bit of a leap of faith here based on some indications I got from a real good source,\" Russell told 94WIP, in Philadelphia, on Friday.\"Bryce and his representatives, (Scott) Boras, his people, his wife Kayla, they've been meeting since Monday morning in Vegas. Bryce originally wanted this done, when it took this long, by Valentine's Day. Obviously, the contract has not been announced, signed, or whatever.\"\"But I'm led to believe by the people that I've talked to that are close to the situation -- and I have, again, a real good source that has helped me through this process, let's just leave it at that,\" Russell said. \"That Bryce was in a mood to celebrate yesterday. Now, the source said, 'I believe it's done.' I don't have concrete, 100 percent proof for you guys. I wish I did, otherwise, I would have it and I would be running around with it. But I don't have that, so I want to caution everybody in Philadelphia. But that's what I was led to believe, that this thing is now decided.\"Russell then mentioned the Phillies.\"Now, what comes then is hammering out a contract. And if we were to believe the report that the Philadelphia Phillies had not even extended a formal offer -- and I assume that to be a termed, written agreement, that type of thing, which I find hard to believe -- then there might be more legwork to this. And therefore, hey the decision may be done, but the contract still needs to be ironed out.\"[RELATED: Phillies fan participates in \"lent\" in hopes of recruiting Harper]Russell is being safe with the terminology he's using, which is understandable. And while we haven't been able to confirm these rumors, Harper, along with many other free agents, remains unsigned.The Giants appeared to be the \"mystery team\" that introduced themselves late into the Harper sweepstakes -- and when the radio hosts asked Russell his opinion on where the outfielder will end up next season, he believed Harper will be in an orange and black uniform.\"I don't think it's going to be the Nationals,\" Russell said. \"I think it's going to be the San Francisco Giants, but that is not by any means an 'I know that for a fact,' so I want to caution everybody -- I know how this works -- I get in trouble with everything I say on my radio show, and everyone blows it up.\" The wait continues ... Golden State Warriors stars Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant empathised with Steve Kerr after the head coach was ejected during the loss to the Portland Trail Blazers having thrown a clipboard in response to a flagrant foul call.Kerr was enraged late in the fourth quarter when Draymond Green was called for a flagrant foul after he stopped Zach Collins from approaching the rim as he went up for a shot.That drew Kerr's ire and after ranting in one referee's face, he slammed a clipboard down to earn an ejection, with Durant having to escort his head coach back off the court.The Warriors lost the game 129-107 but will still head into the All-Star break with the best record in the Western Conference.\"It was an emotional game. We fought really hard for 43 minutes,\" Curry told reporters afterwards.\"One questionable decision - the flagrant - obviously the fire came out. You see coach go and throw a clipboard. At that point you try to get us over the hump. An eight-point swing, it's tough to overcome.\"\"I looked at the replay and the amount of ball [Green] got, there was nothing excessive about it, he got all the ball.\"There was a lot of chirping, with Zach involved. There was probably a sensitivity to it, trying to put out some fires, but I thought it was a terrible call. We obviously paid the price for it with how everything unfolded after that.\"Durant shared that sympathy having been the one to pull Kerr away from the referees as he continued to rant at them.\"I felt for him, I understand his anger and his rage, especially for that call,\" he said.\"I thought we should have just kept playing, It was a common foul, I thought. Refs looked at it differently. \"I understand why coach was a little frustrated.\"Kerr explained that it was the disbelief at the call that had triggered his reaction.\"I was just shocked that that was called a flagrant foul,\" he said. \"I'm not sure how it's determined - if it's in New York or the officials on the call - but that was head-scratching: that that could be called a flagrant foul.\"The guy's going to go in for a dunk, you've got to make sure he doesn't dunk it.\"So, I told Kenny [Mauer] that I beg to differ. There might have been a couple of other words in there too!\"I'll have to ask the owner if the clipboard broke when I threw it down. I got a little anger out so that was good. I was too busy yelling to ask for an explanation.\"Charles Barkley thinks New Orleans Pelicans star Anthony Davis made a mistake with his trade request.The 25-year-old asked the Pelicans to move him in late January and the Los Angeles Lakers had been engaged in discussions about acquiring him. But, no deal was reached before the deadline and Davis remained with New Orleans.Barkley, an 11-time All-Star who works as an analyst for TNT, said he thinks Davis and his agent, Rich Paul, mishandled the situation.\"Don't ruin your reputation as a great player, one of the nicest guys in the world,\" Barkley told reporters on Thursday ahead of All-Star weekend (via the Washington Post).\"Remember, your agent works for you, you don't work for him. They handled that situation wrong. It's going to come back to bite them in the a***. It's unfortunate.\"The six-time All-Star entered play on Thursday averaging 28.5 points and 13.1 rebounds this season. But, he scored just three points in 24 minutes on the floor in the Pelicans' 118-88 loss to the Orlando Magic earlier this week.\"This is a bad situation,\" Barkley said. \"It's a bad look for the NBA. Because that kid can't go out there and give 100 per cent because he’s worried about getting hurt. The guy's the second-best player in the world and he's got three points? That's not a good look for the NBA.\"The Boston Celtics and New York Knicks, among others, are expected to explore dealing for Davis after the season. Barkley, however, said he believes the forward will eventually land in Los Angeles because of Paul's relationship with Lakers star LeBron James.Barkley tallied 22.1 points and 11.7 rebounds per game over his 16-year career. He retired in 2000 and was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame six years later.After an apology from Sergio Garcia, a non-apology from Matt Kuchar, and an uncooperative Mother Nature on Valentine's Day, it's time for everyone to focus again on Tiger Woods. Kidding. Sort of. A weather-delayed first round at Riviera re-starts on Friday morning and the 14-time major champ will be in the Hollywood-area spotlight as he finally begins his Genesis Open. And golf fans could potentially see a LOT of the tournament host as the event tries to play catch up after heavy rains on Thursday.Woods, Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas (Decent group, eh?) are scheduled to tee off at 8:32 local time (11:32 ET). The hope is they will complete their first rounds and then play as much of their second rounds as possible before darkness. And Tiger's hope is to finally win for the first time at this historic layout where he missed the cut last year. We'll be tracking Tiger every step of the way so keep it right here for the latest scores, news and highlights. (All times eastern)SATURDAY, 11:25: With a 25-foot birdie putt on No. 9, Woods' final hole of the second round, Tiger will likely make the cut. The birdie brought Woods back to even on his round and to one under overall.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096808527694245890After resuming play in the morning, Woods bogeyed his first hole, No. 4, then made four pars before his finishing birdie. His playing partners, however, fared much better. Justin Thomas shares the lead with Adam Scott at 11 under and Rory McIlroy birdied four of his six holes on Saturday morning to shoot 63 and move to seven under through 36 holes. Thursday's early wave is now on the course for their second rounds.-------------------FRIDAY-------------------8:25: And with that, the horn has sounded—play will be suspended for darkness on Friday at Riviera. Tiger, JT and Rory have six more holes to complete their second round. Justin Thomas is at 10-under, tied with Adam Scott for the lead. Tiger will hope Saturday brings some different momentum for him—as this marathon day ends with two bogeys in a row after the highlight eagle.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10965708926692065298:21: That's back-to-back bogeys now for Tiger Woods, dropping another shot here at the third hole (his 12th of the round). And over his past six holes, Tiger has four bogeys. The birdie at No. 1 helped negate most of that damage ... but Tiger's back to 1-under again—right on the current cut line.8:13: On his 30th hole of the day, Tiger is showing some obvious signs of being tired. And who could blame him—he's been playing golf for nearly 10 hours straight. From 165 yards out at the third hole, Tiger Woods tries to chop out a 6-iron and comes out of it. His ball comes to rest short of the green. With sunset in Pacific Palisades being 5:30 local time, this group will have time for maybe one more hole today.8:04: Tiger follows up that eagle putt at No. 1 with a bogey at the second hole. The third bogey of his second round moves Tiger back to 2-under overall.7:56: After a long wait at the second hole, Tiger sprays his second shot from 235 out with a fairway wood out to the right. He'll have his work cut out from the front right bunker to save par at the 482-yard par 4.7:40: This is exactly what Tiger Woods needed: He rolls in his 43-foot eagle putt at his 10th hole (the first) to get back to 3-under—negating those two bogeys he made on his front nine. What a putt! With the flagstick in!https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096570892669206529Tiger made a disappointing par to open his first round earlier today at the first hole. The unlikely eagle makes up for that effort—and could turn around Tiger's second round in a dramatic way. Tiger goes from toeing the cut line at 1-under to now all of a sudden being T-21.7:28: Tiger finds the fairway at the par-5 first hole, the group's 10th hole of their second round, as he attempts to get a shot back here after bogeying two of his final three holes on his front nine. Neither bogey was particularly bad—the 18th hole is playing brutally tough right now uphill and into the wind with the rain, making it even more of a challenging hole. And his break at 16 was very unlucky.7:16: Tiger and JT are gonna have their work cut out to save par at the 18th hole (their ninth). Each player had fairway wood approaches and tried playing a big cut. JT was way up left on the hill—Tiger was closer. He went high with his approach and will have about 11 feet left for par.Tiger misses the par putt, so he'll drop a shot along with JT as they make the turn. Tiger moves back to 1-under after 27 holes. That's where the cut line currently is—so all of a sudden, Tiger must be concerned about making the cut.7:01: Following Justin Thomas throwing a dart at the 17th to about 3 feet, Tiger puts his wedge shot from under 100 yards to outside 20 feet, so he'll be disappointed with that effort. The birdie putt misses on the high side, and Tiger taps in for par to remain at 2-under. His playing partner and buddy Justin Thomas stays hot, rolling in a fourth straight birdie to get to 9-under—tied for the lead with Adam Scott. Really impressive golf here from JT.6:54: The rain is really coming down now as the players head to the 17th hole. Tiger finds the fairway at the par-5 17th hole, but it was a short one—he has 326 yards left. Most players have been laying up at this par 5 all day.6:43: From a brutal position up against the back lip of the bunker, Tiger hacks it out—and somehow keeps the ball on the green, albeit the back portion. His par attempt from 44 feet away here comes up three feet shy. Tiger makes his bogey to move back to 2-under.Meanwhile, Justin Thomas is officially on fire. He has another birdie after a fabulous tee shot at 16. It's now two Kentucky boys tied at the top: Justin Thomas and J.B. Holmes (-8).https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10965576791939317766:39: Tiger will have serious lie issues at the par-3 16th hole. His tee shot came to rest up against the back lip of the bunker. As Billy Kratzert just remarked on PGA Tour Live, Tiger will do well just to keep this ball on the green. Though he avoided dropping a shot on his last hole, there might be a bogey in his future here.6:35: A clutchhh par save by Tiger at the 15th hole makes up for his poor chip—and Tiger keeps the momentum going on his second round, as he stays 3-under for the tournament and 2-under on the round.Justin Thomas, also in Tiger's group, holed out from in front of the green for birdie at the 14th hole, and he makes a long birdie putt at 15 to get to 7-under—just one back of fellow Kentucky native J.B. Holmes.6:32: A poor chip shot from Tiger at the 15th hole leaves him about 13 feet away. He'll need to convert that putt to prevent dropping his first shot of his second round.6:24: Tiger finds another fairway here at Riviera, this one at the 15th hole. The guy is feeeling it with his driver. Almost on auto pilot. His approach from 190 out turns a little too much, finding the rough to the left of the green. He'll have to get up and down to avoid dropping one here.6:20: From 20 feet out, Tiger's birdie bid comes up shy—never really scaring the hole, despite getting a good look at the line from Rory's putt. Tiger taps in for par to remain at 3-under.The putter has been disappointing for Tiger all day: He had 34 putts in his first round, including four three-putts, just the third time in his career he's done that.6:13: Tiger puts his tee shot at the par-3 14th hole just inside Rory's ball—about 20 feet right of the hole. He'll get a little teach from Rory's putt, too, as Tiger continues to hit it well today.6:07: Tiger just misses the left-to-right curling bid for birdie, leaving himself with an easy par at 13. He stays 3-under for the tournament and -2 through four on his round.Tiger's playing partners are also playing well—Rory has three birdies in his first four holes to get to 2-under. Look out for Rory at rainy Riviera. And Justin Thomas, despite hitting his tee shot out of bounds at 13, got up and down from 160 yards to avoid dropping multiple shots. He's now 5-under after that bogey.6:02: Another grooved tee shot for Tiger Woods at the 13th hole puts him in good position. He turned over his tee shot—putting his draw in the middle of the fairway at the dogleg left. Tiger spins his approach back to about 15 feet, just off the green in the fringe. He'll have a chance to knock another one here and keep the momentum going.5:51: Bang! Tiger nails the 25-footer for birdie at the 12th hole to add a second birdie to his card through three holes. Realistically, too, it could be three straight birdies for Tiger. But the 14-time major champion is now 2-under through 3—T-3 for the tournament (T-19)—and carries some strong momentum on his side at the start of his second round ... as the rain is coming down at Riviera.5:46: Tiger hits his approach hole high—about 25 feet from 181 yards. He'll have another chance to add a birdie to his third round.Tiger's currently at 2-under, which puts him at T-29. The projected cut is at 1-under—so he's comfortably inside the number as of now. But there's a ton of golf to be played, obviously.5:41: Tiger finds the fairway with his driver at the par-4 12th hole. The 12th usually plays as one of the toughest holes at Riviera—we'll see if Tiger can take advantage of his position here in the fairway.5:33: An excellent fairway-wood second shot by Tiger put him right in front of the par-5 11th green in two. But a very poor approach putt for his third leaves him more than 10 feet away. His birdie try slides by for a very disappointing par being so close in 2. That should've been a golden opportunity to start his second round with two birdies—instead, Tiger stays at 2-under.5:12: Tiger goes high with his pitch—having to navigate around the front bunker, and plays it nicely—spinning it about 7 feet short of the hole. So Tiger will have a good look for an opening birdie to start his second round. Tiger converts the birdie putt to move to 2-under.5:02: Only a little more than a half hour after finishing his first round, Tiger Woods (-1) -- along with Justin Thomas (-5) and Rory McIlroy (+1) -- has teed off in his second round. The group started on the drivable 10th hole, and Tiger has driven his tee shot just off the green. He'll have a chance to put his pitch shot close to start his second round with a birdie.4:24: Tiger narrowly misses the birdie putt at the 18th hole, so he'll tap in for a par and an opening-round, one-under 70 at Riviera. Having three-putted for a fourth time on the 17th hole to drop a shot in disappointing fashion, Tiger will head to his second round a bit frustrated. But the four consecutive birdies showed him being able to score well at Riviera, where he has never won.Tiger, JT (who birdied 18 to finish at 5-under) and Rory will head right back for their second round in this marathon day for them.4:18: Tiger responds to that shocking three-putt with a perfect drive and a towering 6-iron on Riviera's famed 18th. Woods is in good shape to at least make par the difficult hole, but as we've seen all day, a two-putt is anything but automatic.Here's an unusual stat on Tiger three-putting four times this afternoon. He's making some history in a bad way...https://twitter.com/JustinRayGolf/status/10965196250582507574:06: So much for the momentum. . . After a decent approach shot that spins back to about 20 feet, Woods runs his birdie putt a couple feet by and. . . gulp. . . misses the comebacker from about two feet. Wow. That's four three-putts on the day as Tiger falls back to one under with one hole to play.3:57: Uh-oh, it's raining in southern California again. Meanwhile, Woods is plodding his way up the par-5 17th. After pulling his drive into the left rough and drawing a poor lie, Woods pushed his layup slightly into the first cut of the right rough. He'll have a some sort of wedge to a back-right hole location.3:50: Tiger's tee shot was tracking on the par-3 16th, but it comes up about 30 feet short. From there, he two-putts for par to remain at two under. Justin Thomas makes his 10-foot birdie effort to move to four under, while Rory McIlroy remains at one over. McIlroy hast two holes to avert his first over-par score of 2019.3:40: After another great drive and a solid approach, Woods races his birdie attempt nearly five feet past the hole. But he keeps the overall positive momentum going by converting the par putt to remain at two under. Tiger has three more holes to play. At least, before he gets a lunch break.3:24: BANG! There's the bounce back from Tiger. It just came one hole later. And from farther away as Woods drains his 12-footer for birdie on No. 14.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096507996031467520Woods is now back to two under, five shots behind Jordan Spieth, who has to be pleased to still be in front by two despite these soft conditions.3:17: Tiger hits a great shot on the difficult par-3 14th hole to about 15 feet. He'll have a good look at birdie coming up. In the meantime, here's a look at how the leader board stands with Jordan Spieth still leading the way.Jordan Spieth (-7) 2t. Tony Finau (-5) 2t. Patrick Rodgers (-5) 2t. Kramer Hickok (-5) 2t. Davis Love III (-5) 2t. Adam Scott (-5) 2t. J.B. Homes (-5)Click here for full scores.3:13: Woods stuck his approach to about four feet below the hole on No. 13. A bounce back birdie looked like a forgone conclusion until he pushed his effort. Woof. That's two three-putts and two short misses on the greens for Tiger today. He remains at one under. Meanwhile, Rory McIlroy, after getting to two under through eight, has fallen to one over after back-to-back bogeys. Justin Thomas, the third player in the group, continues to lead this trio at three under.3:05: After hitting fade after fade, Woods steps to the 13th tee and rips a draw around the corner, perfectly setting up his next shot. Good to see him working it both ways with ease.3:01: Tiger pushed his tee shot into the right rough, then hit a fantastic recovery shot from a thick lie onto the green. He had a long look at birdie that rolled about four feet past, leaving him with a tricky left-to-right par putt, which he missed. That's three three putts on the day for Woods, and he's still one under.2:39: Not the best chip from Woods, as he left himself about six feet for birdie, but he makes it anyway. Four straight for Tiger to get to two under for the day.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10964952191957975042:30: Woods rips a 3-wood from 269 to just in front of the green. Hate to jinx him, but there's no reason he shouldn't easily make his fourth straight birdie here (ducks).2:20: Three in a row for Woods as he rolls in another at No. 10 and moves to one under. If he finds the fairway again at the 11th, four in a row will be in his sights. Meanwhile, Rory makes his par to stay at one under and JT ends up holing his 10 footer for birdie to get to four under. Finally a little bit of JUICE from this threesome.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096489287753711616https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096489787672780800By the way, it looks like we know when they'll be heading back out for round two later today. Here's an update from the Tiger Tracker:https://twitter.com/GCTigerTracker/status/1096481806067523585That should give them enough time to get at least 11 or 12 holes in.At the 11th, Woods stripes another drive down the fairway. He's really starting to cook.2:12: Tiger's shot was a tad more difficult than we thought, as he had to avoid a bunker and take it up high to get it back to the pin. He was successful, sticking it to about three feet. Hell of a shot. Even better was Rory's shot, as he flopped it from a nice lie and got it to hang on just off the back of the green and stay out of the back bunker. Thomas, who had the easiest shot, put too much spin on his chip, leaving himself with about 10 feet for birdie.2:07: Finally, Tiger, Rory and JT hit their tee shots, and it looks like the ensuing entertainment will be well worth the wait. Tiger is in the collection area left of the green, where he has a straightforward chip that should set him up with a good chance to make birdie. Thomas is just in front of the green, and he'll have a great chance to make a birdie as well. Rory ... um ... not so much. He's in the rough with a greenside bunker in front of him and a pin he won't be able to get close to, and just holding the green would be a miracle.1:52: Woods drains his four-footer for bird and turns in even par 35. Real strong finish to his opening nine, and now it looks like he'll have a long wait at the 10th. DeChambeau, Kuchar and Rahm have still yet to hit their tee shots.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10964831254067896321:47: Tiger had just 122 left to the green and stuck one in there close. He has four feet left for birdie to turn in even par, which would be a small victory after that ugly three putt back at No. 7. Not to mention he'll have a prime opportunity to get into red figures at the driveable par-4 10th.1:41: Woods cranks another high fade right down the middle with the driver at No. 9. With the tees up today, he'll have a low iron in his hand for his approach.1:34: And he's on the board! Woods bounces back with a birdie putt from 15 feet, getting him back to one over. We'll see if that gets him going before making the turn.1:30: From 125 yards out, Woods hit a wedge and hated it from the second he made contact. While he did pull it, he's still hole high and inside 20 feet. Hideki Matsuyama-esque move from Tiger.1:24: Woods rips one right down the middle at the par-4 eighth. Should have a short iron in.1:15: Tiger's birdie putt was actually from just off the green on the fringe, and he rolled it by some four feet. Then, he missed the comebacker for par, dropping to two over on the day. Oof.1:09: Fairway and a green for Woods at the seventh. Good look at birdie coming up to get back to level par.12:58: Another hole, another par for Woods, who two-putted from 24 feet on the par-3 sixth. In the group up ahead, though, Jon Rahm is making a move at three under through six.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/109646557828021452912:47: Another meh hole for Tiger on No. 5, just missing the fairway with his tee shot, finding the front of the green with a so-so approach, and two-putting for another par from 43 feet. Woods remains at one over through five holes while his playing partners, McIlroy and Thomas, both remain at one under.12:42: As Matt Kuchar's ball is in the air on the par-3 sixth, a fan yells, \"Go low—just not with the gratuity!\" Despite Matt maintaining this is \"not a story,\" it is. And this won't be the last comment like this.12:29: Woods hit a nice shot to about 15 feet on the par-3 fourth, but ran his birdie effort by the hole. Still one over. Still no highlights. At least, from Tiger. Here was Spieth's closing birdie from about an hour ago, because there is not much else exciting going on right now.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/109644546143346688112:17: Another missed fairway and another short approach from Tiger on the par-4 third. Although, Woods found the putting surface, he was unable to two-putt from 63 feet, missing a seven-footer for par after badly misreading his first putt. That drops Tiger to one over through three holes. Not a lot of highlights so far. . .12:02: Tiger misses right off the tee on No. 2 then comes up short on another approach. But his pitch shot nearly goes down, leaving him with a tap-in par. Even par through two holes.11:49: After that perfect opening tee shot, Tiger hit a hideous approach with a 5-iron that came up way short in a fairway bunker. From there, he hit his third to 10 feet but missed the putt to walk away with a disappointing par. Both of Tiger's playing partners, McIlroy and Thomas, make birdie.11:38: Matt Kuchar just misses his eagle attempt from 25 feet on No. 1, but taps in for birdie. Kuchar has been in the news a lot this week over a caddie controversy dating back to his win at the Mayakoba Golf Classic. A controversy he didn't help with his comments on Wednesday. Is it possible some of those \"Kuuuuch\" shouts will turn to \"Mooooch\"? Kinda sounded like it on the first hole. . .11:34: Jordan Spieth is in with a seven-under-par 64 to take the early lead. Spieth needed only 21 putts during his bogey-free round. Of course, starting tournaments hasn't been a problem for Spieth of late. Finishing, however, has been a different story. Incredibly, Spieth is looking for his first win since the 2017 British Open and his first top 5 since last year's Masters.11:32: Woods smashes a driver off the first tee that finds the fairway. The opening par 5 at Riviera is essentially a long par 4 and one of the easiest holes on the PGA Tour all year so Tiger is thinking at least birdie after that tee shot.10:53: So far, so good on the Friday weather:https://twitter.com/GCTigerTracker/status/1096437235262533632And with lift, clean and place in play (for at least the first round), low scores are out there. Let's set the over/under on the Par-71 layout at 68.5.10:45: We are approximately 45 minutes away from Tiger's tee time and it's another major champ who is already off to a fantastic start. Jordan Spieth has the lead at six under through 15 holes. Spieth leads Patrick Rodgers by one and then there's a big group at four under, including Bill Haas, who is playing in the event a year after being involved in a car accident during last year's tournament that killed a friend he was staying with. Make sure you read Brian Wacker's piece from earlier in the week on how Haas is still trying to move on from that tragedy.10:35: As we move within an hour from Tiger teeing off, check out GOLFTV's latest behind-the-scenes video with Woods in which he says his bag has up to 16(!) golf gloves during rainy rounds and he explains why he doesn't like wearing rain jackets:https://twitter.com/GOLFTV/status/1096246456795697153\"Pops used to say, 'Once you're wet, you're wet.

Once he started running the front office, his blinking at Paul George on national TV contributed to the Lakers getting fined again for tampering. Johnson’s praise of Giannis Antetokounmpo drew yet another tampering fine.So, though he escaped punishment for his recent comments on 76ers guard Ben Simmons, Johnson refused to answer a question about Hornets guard Kemba Walker.Carolina Blitz:Asked Magic about Kemba and he said y’all aren’t going to catch him slipping anymore. pic.twitter.com/sQZtIWnQbn— Carolina Blitz (@KeepBlitzin) February 15, 2019Johnson:You know I can’t answer any questions about no players, because every time I do it, I get fined. But anybody else do it, they don’t get fined. So I’m going to stay away from that one.I don’t blame Johnson for feeling that way.Other teams’ owners, coaches and executives have repeatedly publicly discussed rival players without facing announced punishment.To be fair, the NBA doesn’t reveal every fine. Bucks owner Marc Lasry reportedly just got fined for tampering, but the league never announced it. But, at minimum, there’s an inconsistency with how the NBA exposes Johnson’s transgressions.Even NBA commissioner Adam Silver said last year there’s a spotlight on the Lakers due to prior tampering. That strikes me as unfair. The Lakers already paid for their prior violations and should now be held to the same standard as everyone else.And for what it’s worth, I wish that standard allowed an all-time great point guard like Johnson to publicly share his thoughts on Kemba Walker.Gareth Bale has landed himself in hot water after La Liga denounced the Real Madrid star for his celebration in the Madrid derby, which could carry a ban of four to 12 games.The Welsh forward scored as a substitute in the 3-1 victory over Atletico Madrid, bringing up his 100th goal for the club.And during the celebrations that followed, Bale \"lifted his right arm near his head in a clear sign of provocation towards the fans, then giving a gesture which could be seen as obscene and disdainful by folding his arm and striking it with his other hand.\"In a statement released by La Liga, Bale’s punishment will be decided by whether he incited the crowd or not.If Bale is guilty of “inciting opposition fans” to cause a hostile reaction, the punishment could carry four to 12 games, if there was no hostile reaction but intent, then it could be as little as one to three games.The gesture is referred to in Spain as ‘corte de mangas,’ with the moment not picked up in the referee’s match report.A committee will now decide whether the gesture merits a punishment.Bale also featured in Real’s Champions League victory over Ajax.Los Blancos take a 2-1 lead back to the Bernabeu for the second leg of the last 16 tie after Marco Asensio’s late winner.Earlier this week Heisman Trophy winner — and first round draft pick of the Oakland Athletics — Kyler Murray chose football over baseball, committing himself to the NFL draft. It was a move that, however sensible from Murray’s point of view, has led to a lot of soul-searching among baseball folks and has raised questions about what the sport offers young, talented athletes with other options.It’s not that bleak, however! Another outstanding college football player said no to football this week and reaffirmed his commitment to baseball. Tim Tebow! From PFT:One Florida Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback will not be coaching another in the Alliance of American Football.Steve Spurrier, the Florida Heisman winner who later coached the Gators to a national championship and is now head coach of the AAF’s Orlando Apollos, said this morning on PFT Live that after the AAF briefly reached out to Tebow in the ball, it became clear that Tebow’s focus is on playing baseball.Ok, so maybe Tebow is not turning down quite the football opportunity that Murray would’ve been.

In the last month alone he's won his 44th PGA Tour event, finished second in another, hit every fairway in a round for the first time in 21 years, shot a 60, pulled off this impossible recovery shot, gone viral just by rolling his eyes and said he might drop the Players from his schedule because he's already won it (a literal mic drop). The man simply cannot be stopped right now.Leave it to the weather to literally rain on Lefty's parade. On Thursday at the Genesis Open, Mickelson began his first round at the difficult short par-4 10th and drove into one of the bunkers up near the green, leaving him with a dreaded lengthy sand shot. He wound up hitting it over the green, and his ball plugged in the back bunker, setting up an even harder shot than he just had. As you'll hear PGA Tour Live commentator Shane Bacon say, avoiding making a six was probably the goal, but after Mickelson hit his third into another bunker on the other side of the green, a six suddenly became best-case scenario. How does a four sound instead?https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096076528142626818Find us a more Phil Mickelson par ever... you can't. He's always got a flair for the dramatic. The problem?

(Old man golfers)The dust is barely settled in the wake of the end of the Markelle Fultz era in Philadelphia, and the former 76ers guard is already taking shots at his old team.His old coach Brett Brown in particular.Fultz had his introductory press conference with the Orlando Magic on Thursday after being traded at last week’s deadline and praised his new coach Steve Clifford while taking a veiled shot at Brown.“It just excites me to know that I have a coach that’s going to push you to be better and not just going to tell you what you want to hear,” Fultz said.That’s direct praise for his new coach. But the message for Brown is clear. Fultz didn’t like what he heard from the Philadelphia coaching staff.Fultz never had any public dispute with the 76ers, but it was evident that he and the team had different approaches to the struggles that saw him shoot 41.4 percent from the field, 26.7 percent from 3-point distance and 53.4 percent from the line in limited action after being selected as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2017 draft.It’s still not clear whether injury or a mental block – or both – are the cause of his shooting issues.After his agent announced that the nerve disorder thoracic outlet syndrome was the root of the shooting woes, Fultz never played again for the 76ers.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]Fultz appears to be fully embracing the fresh start in Orlando as a player and a person.“I think the biggest thing we talked about what doing thing the right way,” Fultz said. “Just building me up both as a man and on the court. I think that’s music to my ears, really just. Two things I really want to do is be the best player I can be and be the best young man I can be.”Fultz described the experience of his nerve disorder to reporters.“It’s hard to lift up your arms, you lose feeling in your fingers,” Fultz said. “You can’t tell when it’s going to happen. It’s not like you do the same motion every time. You get tingling in your fingers, numbness. Stuff like that.”He also curtly dismissed any notion that his shooting struggles are due to anything but injury.“I had an injury,” Fultz said. “I was out there trying to play through that. I never lost confidence.”Asked about a timetable to return, Fultz dodged the question to talk about rehab.“Right now it’s just about getting everything the right way,” he said. “Rehab’s been going great. I’m just taking my time and doing everything the right way.”More from Yahoo Sports: • PGA Tour pro defends paying caddie $5K on $1.3M win • NFL bars NCAA’s all-time sack leader from combine • Only one NBA team failed to scout Antetokounmpo • Black History honor for Kaepernick sacked by lawmakers He might not be well known to NFL fans at large, but New England Patriots fans know linebacker Kyle Van Noy — acquired basically for free from the Detroit Lions at the 2016 trade deadline — has been a big part of the defense the last two years, and has a knack for making plays at the right time.Van Noy is getting a little shine after winning his second Super Bowl ring with New England, appearing on the “Pardon My Take” podcast on Thursday to dish on all things Patriots and Super Bowl LIII.One thing that Van Noy revealed: the Los Angeles Rams didn’t do anything surprising during the game on offense.“I couldn’t believe that,” Van Noy said. “They really didn’t do — not one wrinkle. I was like, ‘What the hell?’ They’ve got so many good players, they’ve got so many things they’ve done all year, and the one play they gave us which was a wrinkle was the [Brandin] Cooks screen that hit for a little bit.“And that was it… Or maybe too, we were playing so good they were like, ‘[Expletive], we don’t know what to do.’ ”Hindsight, of course, is 20-20, but given that the Patriots’ coaching staff is known for having its players prepared for any and everything, it seems unwise that Los Angeles didn’t add some new plays or looks to try to stump New England.Van Noy said the Patriots’ culture, specifically coach Bill Belichick’s practice of not sparing anyone in the film room, even Tom Brady, is part of why the team continues to win.“Oh yeah. Yeah, that [stuff is] sick, to be honest, because it sets the table,” Van Noy said. “Like, OK, it doesn’t matter who you are, everyone’s on an even playing field. This is how it is here at work. You come in and you earn everything.“And I respect that because I felt like that gave me a chance to get on the field when I came in mid-year, and [Belichick] was like, ‘It doesn’t matter who you are or what you’ve done. You earn your keep.’ ”More from Yahoo Sports: • Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight The Brady Conundrum: How do you go about replacing the GOAT? originally appeared on nbcsportsboston.comThe Patriots hatched a Tom Brady succession plan after the 2013 season when they drafted Jimmy Garoppolo.Brady blew that up.Now, five years, four Super Bowl appearances, three Super Bowl wins, two Super Bowl MVPs and a regular-season MVP later, it's time to gingerly -- caaaauuuuuutiooooousssssllllyyyyy -- begin the process again.This time should be different.Even though Brady's contract hasn't been extended past the 2019 season, the love and happiness we saw on the field after the Rams were dispatched in SB53 is a good sign.MORE PATRIOTSAreas of Change: Will Pats be able to retain free agents Trey Flowers and Trent Brown?Brady's wariness about the Patriots' plans for him, and Bill Belichick's wariness about wedding his team to a quarterback who's closer to 50 years old than he is to 30, has dissipated.Once a new deal is in place -- Jonathan Kraft indicated that might be before training camp, though as of the Super Bowl conversations hadn't started -- Brady will have a written assurance that he will leave the Patriots and the NFL on his terms.That wasn't the case in early 2014 when the soon-to-be-37-year-old Brady saw the Patriots spend a first-round pick on a defensive tackle (Dominique Easley) and their second-rounder on Garoppolo. That, after a '13 season Brady spent throwing to the likes of Aaron Dobson, Josh Boyce, Kenbrell Thompkins and Austin Collie.Garoppolo was a stick of dynamite under Brady's behind. He was the existential threat Brady feared made flesh.Jimmy might have thought he was drafted to learn how to play quarterback in the NFL and have a nice career. To Brady, Garoppolo was there to take his job, throw his career into upheaval, uproot his family and see Brady cast out into the NFL wilderness.MORE PATRIOTSPerry: If Beckham is on the trade block, should Patriots be willing to pay the price?And, in contrast to the guy Brady succeeded in 2001 (and, by extension, did all those things to), Brady wasn't going to snort derisively at the plucky little draft pick here to take his job. He would crush the threat.He did.Brady played so well that -- despite Garoppolo developing into a bona-fide front-line quarterback under Belichick and Josh McDaniels (and Brady) -- Brady left the ever-prepared Patriots with no recourse when Garoppolo's contract was about to expire.Brady was too good to bench and too important to trade. Garoppolo was too expensive to franchise and too smart to take a \"bridge\" contract so he could watch Brady from the sidelines while his own hair started to gray at the temples. So off he went around Halloween, 2017.A lot's happened in the 16 months since.MORE PATRIOTSPhil Perry's Mock Draft 1.0: Pats start looking for Gronk's replacementBut now here we are, in the offseason of Brady's 42nd year. And the complex question of how to find the player who will eventually replace the greatest quarterback in NFL history still lingers.Do you draft his successor? If you do, do you do it this year? Do you do it next year?Do you try to get into the top 10 to get your pick of the litter? Do you stay put, confident that the muttonheads across the league will miss out as they did with Brady and Garoppolo (or Aaron Rodgers, Russell Wilson, Drew Brees, Brett Favre, Johnny Unitas . . . you get the point)? How much will it cost to get into the top 10? Do you package picks from this season -- when you will have six in the first three rounds -- and pick a sucker who will suck next year and fleece them for their 2020 first-rounder? How high do you have to go for a blue-chip, given the number of first-round quarterbacks that will be taken this year and that were taken in 2018?Is it a trade for somebody another team's given up on or has no work for, like San Francisco's Nick Mullens? A veteran who will hit free agency like Nick Foles, Case Keenum or Teddy Bridgewater?How does the successor play the position? Similar to Brady in that brain/eyes/accuracy/commitment trumps legs/arm strength/versatility?MORE PATRIOTSShould Pats be interested in Demaryius Thomas? No . . . and yesOr is there an embrace of the fact that trying to find a quarterback similar to a guy who came into the league after four years at Michigan at the end of last century with a once-in-a-lifetime work ethic is a pipe dream?Aside from who the successor is and how he plays, can Brady -- the lion in winter -- be tapped to help groom whoever is being brought aboard to take over?Brady -- contrary to sexed-up speculation -- didn't actively undermine Garoppolo at any point. They were teammates. He helped Garoppolo play the position better. They became close. But he wasn't quite showing him his world, either. Brady is famous for saying he's not giving away his secrets to younger quarterbacks until after he's done.With the end-date likely to be agreed upon when he signs an extension, does he become more a mentor so that the success of the franchise has a better chance to continue after he leaves? Would the Patriots want him to do that?Or would they want a blank(ish) slate to work with that isn't saying, \"But Tom said . . . \" when they try to shape him to succeed?And that contract? What's it look like? Does Brady demand pay commensurate with what he's accomplished? Is he in the mood to do the team another financial solid given the only bump they have him in 2018 was incentives he never reached? How does that impact the structure of the team?These questions aren't new. What is new is the level of angst and anxiousness. It's dissipated tremendously.That won't make finding his replacement or choosing the means by which the Patriots will do it any easier. But it's less fraught now.The irony is, the Patriots already successfully found Brady's successor. It's just that 2014 was too soon to go looking for him.Now, can they do it again?Click here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!

Before the team's loss to the Blazers on Wednesday night, he told ESPN that he \"wants to finish his career as a Warrior.\"      View this post on Instagram    Klay wants to stay in The Bay.A post shared by  espn (@espn) on Feb 13, 2019 at 9:23pm PSTThompson is set to be an unrestricted free agent at the end of the 2018-19 season.This isn't the first time Klay has made his feelings known. Even his father Mychal, who played five seasons for the Lakers, believes his son will re-sign with the Warriors. [RELATED: For Steve Kerr, Steph Curry and Klay Thompson are mix of NBA past and present]The Warriors selected Thompson with the No. 11 overall pick in the 2011 NBA Draft. Since then, he's been a five-time NBA All-Star, three-time Finals champion and two-time All-NBA selection. Anything could happen, but it's safe to say the Klay and the Dubs have quite the relationship and are ready to tie the knot.Jason Witten never worked with Kellen Moore as a coach, but he did practice with Moore when both of them were still active players with the Cowboys.That experience is enough for Witten to think Moore has “a way about him” that will pay off in his new job as the Cowboys offensive coordinator. Witten said this week that he believes Moore will be innovative and that the offense will take a “big step” by gearing things around quarterback Dak Prescott.“Yeah, I think he will do the things that Dak likes to do,” Witten said, via the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. “He will do the things they have to do to win. That is the way they have to play. I think they will use the pass to set up the run. Not just the run to set up the pass. I think he will add some nice wrinkles to that offense.”With head coach Jason Garrett coaching in the final year of his contract, Moore’s work with the offense will have a lot to do with how Dallas does in 2019 and with the path the team charts in the years that follow. If Witten’s correct, that path will probably look a lot like the one they’ve been on for a while.The story of Danny Ainge's Greece visit to watch Giannis Antetokounmpo is a wild one originally appeared on nbcsportsboston.comThe Boston Celtics took an early interest in Greece basketball star Giannis Antetokounmpo before he was selected in the 2013 NBA Draft.C's president of basketball operations Danny Ainge actually went over to Europe to watch Antetokounmpo play, and the postgame scene was nothing short of crazy.Fans were going wild, and some of them even yelled at Ainge because they thought he was associated with Antetokounmpo's team -- Ainge was sitting near its bench during the game.Check out the video below to hear the wild story of Ainge's scouting visit to Greece:Time for another \"Finding Giannis\" outtake. The first NBA team to scout Giannis was the Boston Celtics. As is often the case in Greece, hilarity ensued, as told by @GrgpanouOCT about Danny Ainge's visit. #FindingGiannis will be broadcasted Saturday on TNT at 630pm EST. pic.twitter.com/8bLjIjHv77— Jonathan Givony (@DraftExpress) February 14, 2019The Celtics liked what they saw from Antetokounmpo, but they decided to take Gonzaga forward/center Kelly Olynyk with their 2013 first-round pick instead. The C's made a trade with the Dallas Mavericks (who owned the No. 13 pick) to select Olynyk, whose ability to handle the ball and shoot well from the outside as a big man was appealing.Antetokounmpo ultimately was taken by the Milwaukee Bucks with the 15th pick. The \"Greek Freak\" has since become one of the league's best players and arguably is the leading candidate for MVP this season. It's still hard to fault Ainge and other executives for passing on Antetokounmpo, though. He was a very raw talent, and other players in that draft class were expected to provide more immediate contributions.Click here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!

They run the same plays over and over again. All they do is flop and shoot free throws. Maybe they’re even ruining basketball. Who isn’t these days, right?Houston’s offense operates with rigid discipline. The Rockets run and run James Harden off screens until he finds a tenable matchup to exploit. Tenable, so we’re clear, is a loosely defined term for a player who only needs a sliver of space to shoot from anywhere on the floor, whose combined ball-handling and strength psychs out defenders and referees alike.It is repetitive, sure, but in a way that’s endlessly fascinating. The Rockets repeatedly put the ball in the hands of the one of the NBA’s most creative, destructive scorers and wait for him to find a sieve — or create one. Harden now holds the second-longest 30-point scoring streak in NBA history, breaking 31 games in Wednesday night’s loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves, and he’s averaging a league-scorching 36.5 points per game.I’d argue all that makes the Rockets more watchable than most teams, which dilly-dally for possessions at a time, only looking to optimize in the face of urgency. You won’t find any freewheeling action from Iguodala-types in Houston. Even Austin Rivers has (mostly) held himself in check. Every time I turn on a Rockets game, Harden or Chris Paul has possession of the ball and is on the cusp of doing something. The game becomes a successive highlight reel that doesn’t allow you to turn the dial.The same quality that makes the Rockets so entertaining right now — and will likely garner Harden a second MVP — might be what hurts them in the playoffs again. The fuse is burning bright: Harden holds the ball an average of 9.6 seconds when he touches it, the highest mark in the NBA. His usage rate is 39 percent, smashing second place by 7 percent. What Harden’s doing might not be the best idea for the Rockets’ future outlook.But it’s definitely not boring. Even on defense, an opponent can make a name for himself with a signature moment against Harden — just ask Josh Okogie.As for as Harden’s high free-throw attempts bogging the game down, I won’t be convinced that a generation that cuts away to their iPhone screen 50 times per day is that bothered by an opportunity to look away from the action. When Harden’s playing, it’s the only chance you’re going to get.Because it seems like it, at least in the East. For the past few weeks, the dominant Warriors storyline has been about how Kevin Durant’s impending free agency could impact their title run. After a win against the Utah Jazz two nights ago, Durant said he feels the team is not playing well. These are the same Warriors, mind you, who are 16-3 since the New Year. Not only have they won all 11 games DeMarcus Cousins has played in — they’ve blown the tops off buildings, outscoring opponents by 9.7 points per 100 possessions. Until July 1, Warriors inevitability reigns.Why is it, then, that the Eastern Conference is littered with high-end teams that made big bets on winning this year? The Boston Celtics made their bed a while ago, with Kyrie Irving’s contract expiring when the season ends. The Toronto Raptors traded franchise cornerstone DeMar DeRozan for a chance to woo Kawhi Leonard for a season. Then they doubled down by trading for Marc Gasol. In sum, the 76ers exchanged Jerryd Bayless, Robert Covington, Dario Saric, Wilson Chandler, Mike Muscala, Landry Shamet, two first-round picks and two second-round picks for Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris, a pair of stars with deals that expire at the end of the year.(Side note: At least one of these three teams has to flame out in the second round. And then what does it do? For once, the playoff drama will be in the East, if not the title.)Could it be possible that the Warriors are so dominant that they’ve convinced the rest of the NBA to change the goalposts of ultimate success? Because as it stands right now, we’ve got a set of teams that went all in on trying to get to second place. It feels more like they’re auditioning for a post-Warriors future than trying to succeed in the current landscape. Even in a world where success is narrowly defined by wins and losses, perception is everything. And some things are inherent: If the rest of the NBA can’t compete against the Warriors, they still can’t help but compete against themselves.The aftermath of the most emboldened trade request in recent NBA history has been ugly. Anthony Davis is not a Laker — or a Knick or a Celtic or a Buck for that matter. And the New Orleans Pelicans don’t seem to have much use for him either. They’d rather sit him and pile up losses, focus on the lottery race and protect Davis’ health so they can trade him in the offseason. But the NBA issued a directive: The Pelicans would be fined $100,000 for every game he sat.So it is that after playing well enough to keep the Pelicans in it, Davis was benched in the fourth quarter two games in a row. Then, against the Orlando Magic, they got blown out by 30 points, which led to Davis — chef’s kiss — criticizing the team’s effort. So things aren’t good. What’s worse: It doesn’t seem like they’re going to get any better.Thanks to the NBA’s orders, this is the only reasonable compromise for both the Pelicans and Davis. He gets to pervert his livelihood — surely important to a man who has spent so many days involuntarily sidelined by injuries — while the Pelicans at least get to lose some of the time.Here’s what it comes down to: The NBA can’t make a decision that weighs the Pelicans real interests, because it can’t be so blithely rational about what’s best for them, which is tanking. In an alternate universe with no draft lottery, the Pelicans might at least be incentivized to let Davis play when it matters to get fans in seats. But the league won’t acknowledge its worst kept secret, so a dysfunctional situation is primed to only get worse.Nothing like the 76ers to get the Boston Celtics going. And nothing like a loss to the Celtics on Tuesday night to spread anxiety in the lives of 76ers fans.Despite the addition of Tobias Harris, the 76ers lost to the Kyrie-less Celtics in the same ways they’ve habitually lost to them: The Celtics stuck like glue to the few shooters the 76ers play at the same time and treated Ben Simmons like a non-entity, while Al Horford ate Joel Embiid’s lunch. The Sixers couldn’t protect the perimeter on the other end, so they never got much of a chance to get out in transition.I won’t write them off as quickly as I did after Christmas, if only because Harris is the type of sharpshooter who could tip the scales in favor of an old-school style — if they’re willing to embrace it.Since trading for Jimmy Butler in November, the Sixers are seventh in pace, 11th in defense and 16th in offensive rebounding. This is a team with three starters who are above 6-foot-8, including the league’s most imposing center since Shaq, but it’s stuck in the middle because it’s trying to fit old-school parts into a new-school game. The league has been crashing full-tilt into more space and pace for years, so you can forgive the Sixers for trying, but you don’t win championships by playing against your strengths.Philadelphia should be slow, plodding, muscly and mean. It should crash the glass with impunity, hunt cross-matches with pick-and-rolls and bully defenders in the post. The mere idea of entering the paint against the 76ers should make opponents cower with fear.The only rub is that slowing it down doesn’t serve Ben Simmons’ style, but they’re going to have to figure out the inevitable tension between his transition-happy game and Embiid’s half-court dominance eventually. Better to do it while playing to your strengths and find out if it works now, instead of two years down the road.Following Jeremy Lin’s first game as a Raptor, he took to the podium and shared some interesting thoughts on the presence of the international media. Here are some snippets, from the Toronto Star:“Yeah, [Mandarin media] probably happens in every city that has a strong Asian contingent,” Lin said. “Happened in Atlanta as well, but not this. So again, I’m very proud to represent Asian people on a global platform, on a global scale. And for me to be here where there’s a lot of Asians, like, I used to run from it, you know?“Because that’s all anybody’s ever wanted to look for. Like, ‘Oh, he’s Asian, he’s Asian, he’s Asian.’ And I was like, talk about my basketball. But now people can see I can play, I belong in the NBA, and I’ve really embraced just being able to represent Asians and do it the right way, hopefully.“Yeah, I mean, I think I was really jaded after the New York stretch,” Lin continued. “I think there was a lot of things that happened that made me give up a little bit on people, per se. And that was a huge part of the story, and that was a huge point of contention for a lot of people as to why I was getting the publicity, or why things were the way they were.“So I kind of wanted to run from that a little bit. I would probably say three years down the road, I kind of turned a corner, and I would say being hurt for two straight years, and seeing that my Asian fan base, I don’t feel like it dropped off one bit. And I haven’t even touched the court. Like, every year I go over to Asia and I can’t even walk through the airport — it’s insane. So to see them do that after all the highs and lows, but really going through the lows post-Linsanity, which culminated in those injuries, for me, I’m still blown away. And again, that’s fed into why I want to carry myself a certain way.”I don’t have a lot to say here, except that it’s touching to see a man whose identity was leveraged and controlled by outside forces for so long get to stop running away from how he’s perceived and finally be himself: an NBA player who once turned the basketball universe on its head, an Asian-American, a God-fearing Harvard grad. He has lived long enough in the public eye that the public has finally accepted what they originally thought were contradictory traits. That, friends, is how stereotypes are broken.More from Yahoo Sports:• PGA Tour pro defends paying caddie $5K on $1.3M win • NFL bars NCAA’s all-time sack leader from combine • Only one NBA team failed to scout Antetokounmpo • Black History honor for Kaepernick sacked by lawmakers Isaiah Thomas gets standing ovation, drills 3-pointer in Nuggets debut originally appeared on nbcsportsboston.comBrad Stevens could have begun his All-Star vacation Wednesday night after the Boston Celtics defeated the Detroit Pistons.But Stevens had a Denver Nuggets game to catch.The Celtics head coach set his DVR for Nuggets-Sacramento Kings to watch his former star player, Isaiah Thomas, make his Denver debut after a lengthy absence caused by offseason hip surgery.Thomas didn't disappoint.

At least, maybe you do when you’re Keith Tkachuk, and you’ve raised two true hockey ragamuffins in Brady Tkachuk and Matthew Tkachuk. Chances are, Keith’s probably more preoccupied with getting his sons not to obnoxiously dangle their mouthpieces out of their mouths.(And, yeah, maybe to make sure Matthew doesn’t get hosed on his second contract.)Anyway, Keith was on hand to see – and chuckle at – Brady, the younger of the two NHL Tkachuk kids, getting into a fight with Jonathan Ericsson of the Detroit Red Wings. It’s probably fair to say that Ericsson got the better of Brady, but judge for yourself in the video above this post’s headline, via Sportsnet.Judging by Hockey Fights’ listings, the family fight counts are now unofficially:Brady: Three. He’s a rookie, so he’s clearly endearing himself to opponents already.Matthew: Seven through three seasons.Keith: 51 fights during 1,201 regular-season and 89 playoff contests.Considering the temperaments of the Tkachuk brothers and father, chances are we’ll see more scuffles for both Brady and Matthew before they hopefully enjoy retirement as much as Keith seems to be enjoying it.

In any case, you have to admit the NBA never fails to entertain.More from Yahoo Sports: • Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight When spring training camps opened this week around Major League Baseball, it brought hope that maybe, finally, Bryce Harper and Manny Machado would sign with teams and baseball’s long free-agent freeze would melt away.Nope. Not yet. Not only has that not happened, something else did happen: a number of talented young players around the league have agreed to team-friendly contract extensions.The latest was New York Yankees ace Luis Severino, who on Friday reportedly agreed to a four-year, $40 million deal. The deal, first reported by Joel Sherman of the New York Post, would buy up Severino’s arbitration years and comes with a $15 million club option for his first year of free agency.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]By agreeing to this deal, the Yankees and Severino avoid arbitration for 2019. He’ll make $4 million this season, $10 million next, then $10.25 million in 2021 and $11 million in 2022. The club option is for 2023. In the grand scheme of society, this is a very generous contract. In baseball’s economic bubble, it’s another young player signing for below-market value relative to his skills and potential.It’s hard to blame Severino for taking the deal, looking around at a free-agent world where Harper and Machado are still available, as are Dallas Keuchel and Craig Kimbrel. Especially since we haven’t heard even slight grumblings about teams being interested in Keuchel and Kimbrel.Coming off a breakout season in which he went 19-8 with a 3.39 ERA, the 25-year-old Severino was given a deal that’s pretty hard to turn down: “Do you want $40 million guaranteed, yes or no?”The other players faced with a similar question this week were Philadelphia Phillies ace Aaron Nola, who said yes to a four-year, $45 million deal Wednesday. It also avoided arbitration and bought out two of Nola’s free agency years, making it the most below-market deal of any of these.The Minnesota Twins locked up two of their talented young players Thursday, as right fielder Max Kepler agreed to a five-year, $35 million deal with a $10 million club option for 2024. It buys out three years of free agency for Kepler, 26. Shortstop Jorge Polanco also agreed to a five-year extension, his is worth $25.75 million with two option years that could keep him in Minnesota through 2025.In a vacuum, these types of extensions look like win-wins: The players get guaranteed money as they’re coming off good seasons. The clubs get cost-certainty to help them navigate the future — whether it’s the Yankees and Phillies trying to add big free agents this year or next, or a team like the Twins striving for contention with a homegrown core.In a bigger sense, though, it’s hard not to look at these deals in the current state of free agency and wonder if they’re a symptom of something else. Is it the market correcting itself? Is it baseball’s economy morphing into something new? Or maybe it’s just players looking around and saying, “Well, I better get my money now.”According to numerous reports, there’s a fear that for this generation of young players the light at the end of the tunnel — the big free-agency payday — won’t be there for them in the same way it was for so many other players.So while it’s great that stars like Justin Verlander, Clayton Kershaw and Max Scherzer are publicly speaking out about the current state of free agency, they’re on the right side of it. They got their mega deals.The younger players find themselves in a different sort of peril. It’s entirely possible that these are the biggest paydays these players ever get, which is a much different economic model that we’ve seen from baseball in the past.Whether it’s right or wrong — and that’s certainly something that’s up for debate heading into the next collective-bargaining agreement — baseball’s economy has often been backward. Players get paid less, relative to the market, in their pre-free agency years. The best recent example is Mike Trout winning the MVP in 2014 at age 22 while making $1 million.He got a raise to $6 million the next season, but in 2015 was still making a fraction of what people like Ryan Howard ($25M), Albert Pujols ($24M), Joe Mauer ($23M), Mark Teixeira ($22.5M) and Jose Reyes ($22M) were making.But that overpay is a necessary part baseball’s economic ecosystem too. It’s a fact: Players get overpaid as their careers decline. It’s almost like baseball’s way of making up for underpaying players during their early years. It’s baseball’s golden parachute. What’s happening these days is fewer teams are accepting that overpay as part of the how the system works.In the past few years, arbitration salaries have gotten higher and higher, and teams have tried harder to lock up younger stars before free agency. It’s why we’ve see players like Madison Bumgarner, Chris Archer, Chris Sale and Paul Goldschmidt become valuable trade chips for their team-friendly contract extensions.Teams are getting smarter about where their money goes, and how to keep value in their assets. These extensions to Severino, Nola and the rest show that they’re willing to spend money, just in the way that they want.Earlier this week, former Miami Marlins president David Samson tweeted something in response to Justin Verlander, saying the “broken system” talk was wrong. Players and their agents, Samson said, needed to adjust to a “new reality.”He may be right about the new reality part. The monster paydays at the end of the free agency tunnel could be fading away. If Bryce Harper and Manny Machado can’t get them, who can?The new reality could be players seizing their money. Whenever they can.– – – – – –Mike Oz is a writer at Yahoo Sports.

Follow @MikeOzMore from Yahoo Sports:• Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlightSt. Louis Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright became the latest player to forecast a “doom and gloom” outlook for Major League Baseball based on the growing financial and philosophical disconnect between the players and the owners.The sentiment that a strike will happen is one we’ve become accustomed to hearing from the players. However, Wainwright framed the situation with a little more urgency on Friday by expressing concerns that a day of reckoning could happen sooner than later.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]Speaking to InsideSTL.com’s Tim McKernan, Wainwright said it was inevitable that the players will go on strike unless major changes are made to help bridge the widening gap. But he’s also worried that frustrations could reach a boiling point during the season leading to some form of a revolt. Perhaps even a mid-season walkout.#STLCards pitcher Adam Wainwright on @TMASTL: “Unless something changes, there’s going to be a strike. 100%. I’m just worried people are going to walk-out mid-season.” pic.twitter.com/M8WeRVcASe— Tim McKernan (@tmckernan) February 15, 2019“Unless something changes, there’s going to be a strike. 100%,” Wainwright said regarding the free-agent freeze that has left stars like Bryce Harper and Manny Machado without contracts. “I’m just worried people are going to walkout midseason.”It’s conceivable given the current climate, but a players revolt on that level still feels like a long shot. The target date we should all still be looking at is Dec. 1, 2021. That’s when the current collective bargaining agreement ends and the owners will be forced to come to the table.That doesn’t mean we should just dismiss Wainwright’s concerns about a 2019 strike. While they might feel a little on the dramatic side, the frustration that has built all offseason as dozens of free agents, including and especially Harper and Machado, remain unsigned is becoming more palpable by the day. There’s a genuine feeling that owners are determined to cut back on salaries even as profits continue to reach new heights, it’s possible the players’ patience will run out if the free-agent freeze continues to drag on. Wainwright thinks so, and he’s far from alone.In Friday’s interview, the 37-year-old right-hander also criticized owners and front offense personnel for placing too much emphasis on “analytics” and placing everything in a “sabermetric box” that discounts intangibles and other immeasurable aspects of baseball.Adam Wainwright said today on ⁦@TMASTL⁩ that he expects there to be a strike “100%.”The context of the conversation comes from a discussion on how Bryce Harper and Manny Machado are still without teams.You can see Wainwright’s reasoning in the video below. pic.twitter.com/GXsmx4cXk1— Tim McKernan (@tmckernan) February 15, 2019Wainwright admitted that there’s always risk in making long-term financial commitments to players, but emphasized that doing so marks a commitment to winning that several teams seemingly lack.“Part of it is smart from their side of it, but you have to realize it’s about winning. So, if Bryce Harper wants 10 years and he’s 26 years old. He’s going to be a dynamic player. The same can be said about Manny Machado. These guys are superstar players.”The deeper we get into it the more obvious it is that the players know what battles lie ahead. The only real question is how much worse it will get before any progress is made toward a satisfactory resolution.More from Yahoo Sports:• Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight MLB rumors: Bryce Harper has made his decision, says D.C. radio host originally appeared on nbcsportsbayarea.comA report has come out from the East Coast saying Bryce Harper has come to a decision on which team he will play for in 2019 and beyond.Chris Russell, a sports radio talk show host from 106.7 The Fan in Washington D.C., (who has been on the Harper beat for some time) said the free agent slugger could make a decision in the next 24 hours.\"Maybe I took a little bit of a leap of faith here based on some indications I got from a real good source,\" Russell told 94WIP, in Philadelphia, on Friday.\"Bryce and his representatives, (Scott) Boras, his people, his wife Kayla, they've been meeting since Monday morning in Vegas. Bryce originally wanted this done, when it took this long, by Valentine's Day. Obviously, the contract has not been announced, signed, or whatever.\"\"But I'm led to believe by the people that I've talked to that are close to the situation -- and I have, again, a real good source that has helped me through this process, let's just leave it at that,\" Russell said. \"That Bryce was in a mood to celebrate yesterday. Now, the source said, 'I believe it's done.' I don't have concrete, 100 percent proof for you guys. I wish I did, otherwise, I would have it and I would be running around with it. But I don't have that, so I want to caution everybody in Philadelphia. But that's what I was led to believe, that this thing is now decided.\"Russell then mentioned the Phillies.\"Now, what comes then is hammering out a contract. And if we were to believe the report that the Philadelphia Phillies had not even extended a formal offer -- and I assume that to be a termed, written agreement, that type of thing, which I find hard to believe -- then there might be more legwork to this. And therefore, hey the decision may be done, but the contract still needs to be ironed out.\"[RELATED: Phillies fan participates in \"lent\" in hopes of recruiting Harper]Russell is being safe with the terminology he's using, which is understandable. And while we haven't been able to confirm these rumors, Harper, along with many other free agents, remains unsigned.The Giants appeared to be the \"mystery team\" that introduced themselves late into the Harper sweepstakes -- and when the radio hosts asked Russell his opinion on where the outfielder will end up next season, he believed Harper will be in an orange and black uniform.\"I don't think it's going to be the Nationals,\" Russell said. \"I think it's going to be the San Francisco Giants, but that is not by any means an 'I know that for a fact,' so I want to caution everybody -- I know how this works -- I get in trouble with everything I say on my radio show, and everyone blows it up.\" The wait continues ... Golden State Warriors stars Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant empathised with Steve Kerr after the head coach was ejected during the loss to the Portland Trail Blazers having thrown a clipboard in response to a flagrant foul call.Kerr was enraged late in the fourth quarter when Draymond Green was called for a flagrant foul after he stopped Zach Collins from approaching the rim as he went up for a shot.That drew Kerr's ire and after ranting in one referee's face, he slammed a clipboard down to earn an ejection, with Durant having to escort his head coach back off the court.The Warriors lost the game 129-107 but will still head into the All-Star break with the best record in the Western Conference.\"It was an emotional game. We fought really hard for 43 minutes,\" Curry told reporters afterwards.\"One questionable decision - the flagrant - obviously the fire came out. You see coach go and throw a clipboard. At that point you try to get us over the hump. An eight-point swing, it's tough to overcome.\"\"I looked at the replay and the amount of ball [Green] got, there was nothing excessive about it, he got all the ball.\"There was a lot of chirping, with Zach involved. There was probably a sensitivity to it, trying to put out some fires, but I thought it was a terrible call. We obviously paid the price for it with how everything unfolded after that.\"Durant shared that sympathy having been the one to pull Kerr away from the referees as he continued to rant at them.\"I felt for him, I understand his anger and his rage, especially for that call,\" he said.\"I thought we should have just kept playing, It was a common foul, I thought. Refs looked at it differently. \"I understand why coach was a little frustrated.\"Kerr explained that it was the disbelief at the call that had triggered his reaction.\"I was just shocked that that was called a flagrant foul,\" he said. \"I'm not sure how it's determined - if it's in New York or the officials on the call - but that was head-scratching: that that could be called a flagrant foul.\"The guy's going to go in for a dunk, you've got to make sure he doesn't dunk it.\"So, I told Kenny [Mauer] that I beg to differ. There might have been a couple of other words in there too!\"I'll have to ask the owner if the clipboard broke when I threw it down. I got a little anger out so that was good. I was too busy yelling to ask for an explanation.\"Charles Barkley thinks New Orleans Pelicans star Anthony Davis made a mistake with his trade request.The 25-year-old asked the Pelicans to move him in late January and the Los Angeles Lakers had been engaged in discussions about acquiring him. But, no deal was reached before the deadline and Davis remained with New Orleans.Barkley, an 11-time All-Star who works as an analyst for TNT, said he thinks Davis and his agent, Rich Paul, mishandled the situation.\"Don't ruin your reputation as a great player, one of the nicest guys in the world,\" Barkley told reporters on Thursday ahead of All-Star weekend (via the Washington Post).\"Remember, your agent works for you, you don't work for him. They handled that situation wrong. It's going to come back to bite them in the a***. It's unfortunate.\"The six-time All-Star entered play on Thursday averaging 28.5 points and 13.1 rebounds this season. But, he scored just three points in 24 minutes on the floor in the Pelicans' 118-88 loss to the Orlando Magic earlier this week.\"This is a bad situation,\" Barkley said. \"It's a bad look for the NBA. Because that kid can't go out there and give 100 per cent because he’s worried about getting hurt. The guy's the second-best player in the world and he's got three points? That's not a good look for the NBA.\"The Boston Celtics and New York Knicks, among others, are expected to explore dealing for Davis after the season. Barkley, however, said he believes the forward will eventually land in Los Angeles because of Paul's relationship with Lakers star LeBron James.Barkley tallied 22.1 points and 11.7 rebounds per game over his 16-year career. He retired in 2000 and was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame six years later.After an apology from Sergio Garcia, a non-apology from Matt Kuchar, and an uncooperative Mother Nature on Valentine's Day, it's time for everyone to focus again on Tiger Woods. Kidding. Sort of. A weather-delayed first round at Riviera re-starts on Friday morning and the 14-time major champ will be in the Hollywood-area spotlight as he finally begins his Genesis Open. And golf fans could potentially see a LOT of the tournament host as the event tries to play catch up after heavy rains on Thursday.Woods, Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas (Decent group, eh?) are scheduled to tee off at 8:32 local time (11:32 ET). The hope is they will complete their first rounds and then play as much of their second rounds as possible before darkness. And Tiger's hope is to finally win for the first time at this historic layout where he missed the cut last year. We'll be tracking Tiger every step of the way so keep it right here for the latest scores, news and highlights. (All times eastern)SATURDAY, 11:25: With a 25-foot birdie putt on No. 9, Woods' final hole of the second round, Tiger will likely make the cut. The birdie brought Woods back to even on his round and to one under overall.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096808527694245890After resuming play in the morning, Woods bogeyed his first hole, No. 4, then made four pars before his finishing birdie. His playing partners, however, fared much better. Justin Thomas shares the lead with Adam Scott at 11 under and Rory McIlroy birdied four of his six holes on Saturday morning to shoot 63 and move to seven under through 36 holes. Thursday's early wave is now on the course for their second rounds.-------------------FRIDAY-------------------8:25: And with that, the horn has sounded—play will be suspended for darkness on Friday at Riviera. Tiger, JT and Rory have six more holes to complete their second round. Justin Thomas is at 10-under, tied with Adam Scott for the lead. Tiger will hope Saturday brings some different momentum for him—as this marathon day ends with two bogeys in a row after the highlight eagle.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10965708926692065298:21: That's back-to-back bogeys now for Tiger Woods, dropping another shot here at the third hole (his 12th of the round). And over his past six holes, Tiger has four bogeys. The birdie at No. 1 helped negate most of that damage ... but Tiger's back to 1-under again—right on the current cut line.8:13: On his 30th hole of the day, Tiger is showing some obvious signs of being tired. And who could blame him—he's been playing golf for nearly 10 hours straight. From 165 yards out at the third hole, Tiger Woods tries to chop out a 6-iron and comes out of it. His ball comes to rest short of the green. With sunset in Pacific Palisades being 5:30 local time, this group will have time for maybe one more hole today.8:04: Tiger follows up that eagle putt at No. 1 with a bogey at the second hole. The third bogey of his second round moves Tiger back to 2-under overall.7:56: After a long wait at the second hole, Tiger sprays his second shot from 235 out with a fairway wood out to the right. He'll have his work cut out from the front right bunker to save par at the 482-yard par 4.7:40: This is exactly what Tiger Woods needed: He rolls in his 43-foot eagle putt at his 10th hole (the first) to get back to 3-under—negating those two bogeys he made on his front nine. What a putt! With the flagstick in!https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096570892669206529Tiger made a disappointing par to open his first round earlier today at the first hole. The unlikely eagle makes up for that effort—and could turn around Tiger's second round in a dramatic way. Tiger goes from toeing the cut line at 1-under to now all of a sudden being T-21.7:28: Tiger finds the fairway at the par-5 first hole, the group's 10th hole of their second round, as he attempts to get a shot back here after bogeying two of his final three holes on his front nine. Neither bogey was particularly bad—the 18th hole is playing brutally tough right now uphill and into the wind with the rain, making it even more of a challenging hole. And his break at 16 was very unlucky.7:16: Tiger and JT are gonna have their work cut out to save par at the 18th hole (their ninth). Each player had fairway wood approaches and tried playing a big cut. JT was way up left on the hill—Tiger was closer. He went high with his approach and will have about 11 feet left for par.Tiger misses the par putt, so he'll drop a shot along with JT as they make the turn. Tiger moves back to 1-under after 27 holes. That's where the cut line currently is—so all of a sudden, Tiger must be concerned about making the cut.7:01: Following Justin Thomas throwing a dart at the 17th to about 3 feet, Tiger puts his wedge shot from under 100 yards to outside 20 feet, so he'll be disappointed with that effort. The birdie putt misses on the high side, and Tiger taps in for par to remain at 2-under. His playing partner and buddy Justin Thomas stays hot, rolling in a fourth straight birdie to get to 9-under—tied for the lead with Adam Scott. Really impressive golf here from JT.6:54: The rain is really coming down now as the players head to the 17th hole. Tiger finds the fairway at the par-5 17th hole, but it was a short one—he has 326 yards left. Most players have been laying up at this par 5 all day.6:43: From a brutal position up against the back lip of the bunker, Tiger hacks it out—and somehow keeps the ball on the green, albeit the back portion. His par attempt from 44 feet away here comes up three feet shy. Tiger makes his bogey to move back to 2-under.Meanwhile, Justin Thomas is officially on fire. He has another birdie after a fabulous tee shot at 16. It's now two Kentucky boys tied at the top: Justin Thomas and J.B. Holmes (-8).https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10965576791939317766:39: Tiger will have serious lie issues at the par-3 16th hole. His tee shot came to rest up against the back lip of the bunker. As Billy Kratzert just remarked on PGA Tour Live, Tiger will do well just to keep this ball on the green. Though he avoided dropping a shot on his last hole, there might be a bogey in his future here.6:35: A clutchhh par save by Tiger at the 15th hole makes up for his poor chip—and Tiger keeps the momentum going on his second round, as he stays 3-under for the tournament and 2-under on the round.Justin Thomas, also in Tiger's group, holed out from in front of the green for birdie at the 14th hole, and he makes a long birdie putt at 15 to get to 7-under—just one back of fellow Kentucky native J.B. Holmes.6:32: A poor chip shot from Tiger at the 15th hole leaves him about 13 feet away. He'll need to convert that putt to prevent dropping his first shot of his second round.6:24: Tiger finds another fairway here at Riviera, this one at the 15th hole. The guy is feeeling it with his driver. Almost on auto pilot. His approach from 190 out turns a little too much, finding the rough to the left of the green. He'll have to get up and down to avoid dropping one here.6:20: From 20 feet out, Tiger's birdie bid comes up shy—never really scaring the hole, despite getting a good look at the line from Rory's putt. Tiger taps in for par to remain at 3-under.The putter has been disappointing for Tiger all day: He had 34 putts in his first round, including four three-putts, just the third time in his career he's done that.6:13: Tiger puts his tee shot at the par-3 14th hole just inside Rory's ball—about 20 feet right of the hole. He'll get a little teach from Rory's putt, too, as Tiger continues to hit it well today.6:07: Tiger just misses the left-to-right curling bid for birdie, leaving himself with an easy par at 13. He stays 3-under for the tournament and -2 through four on his round.Tiger's playing partners are also playing well—Rory has three birdies in his first four holes to get to 2-under. Look out for Rory at rainy Riviera. And Justin Thomas, despite hitting his tee shot out of bounds at 13, got up and down from 160 yards to avoid dropping multiple shots. He's now 5-under after that bogey.6:02: Another grooved tee shot for Tiger Woods at the 13th hole puts him in good position. He turned over his tee shot—putting his draw in the middle of the fairway at the dogleg left. Tiger spins his approach back to about 15 feet, just off the green in the fringe. He'll have a chance to knock another one here and keep the momentum going.5:51: Bang! Tiger nails the 25-footer for birdie at the 12th hole to add a second birdie to his card through three holes. Realistically, too, it could be three straight birdies for Tiger. But the 14-time major champion is now 2-under through 3—T-3 for the tournament (T-19)—and carries some strong momentum on his side at the start of his second round ... as the rain is coming down at Riviera.5:46: Tiger hits his approach hole high—about 25 feet from 181 yards. He'll have another chance to add a birdie to his third round.Tiger's currently at 2-under, which puts him at T-29. The projected cut is at 1-under—so he's comfortably inside the number as of now. But there's a ton of golf to be played, obviously.5:41: Tiger finds the fairway with his driver at the par-4 12th hole. The 12th usually plays as one of the toughest holes at Riviera—we'll see if Tiger can take advantage of his position here in the fairway.5:33: An excellent fairway-wood second shot by Tiger put him right in front of the par-5 11th green in two. But a very poor approach putt for his third leaves him more than 10 feet away. His birdie try slides by for a very disappointing par being so close in 2. That should've been a golden opportunity to start his second round with two birdies—instead, Tiger stays at 2-under.5:12: Tiger goes high with his pitch—having to navigate around the front bunker, and plays it nicely—spinning it about 7 feet short of the hole. So Tiger will have a good look for an opening birdie to start his second round. Tiger converts the birdie putt to move to 2-under.5:02: Only a little more than a half hour after finishing his first round, Tiger Woods (-1) -- along with Justin Thomas (-5) and Rory McIlroy (+1) -- has teed off in his second round. The group started on the drivable 10th hole, and Tiger has driven his tee shot just off the green. He'll have a chance to put his pitch shot close to start his second round with a birdie.4:24: Tiger narrowly misses the birdie putt at the 18th hole, so he'll tap in for a par and an opening-round, one-under 70 at Riviera. Having three-putted for a fourth time on the 17th hole to drop a shot in disappointing fashion, Tiger will head to his second round a bit frustrated. But the four consecutive birdies showed him being able to score well at Riviera, where he has never won.Tiger, JT (who birdied 18 to finish at 5-under) and Rory will head right back for their second round in this marathon day for them.4:18: Tiger responds to that shocking three-putt with a perfect drive and a towering 6-iron on Riviera's famed 18th. Woods is in good shape to at least make par the difficult hole, but as we've seen all day, a two-putt is anything but automatic.Here's an unusual stat on Tiger three-putting four times this afternoon. He's making some history in a bad way...https://twitter.com/JustinRayGolf/status/10965196250582507574:06: So much for the momentum. . . After a decent approach shot that spins back to about 20 feet, Woods runs his birdie putt a couple feet by and. . . gulp. . . misses the comebacker from about two feet. Wow. That's four three-putts on the day as Tiger falls back to one under with one hole to play.3:57: Uh-oh, it's raining in southern California again. Meanwhile, Woods is plodding his way up the par-5 17th. After pulling his drive into the left rough and drawing a poor lie, Woods pushed his layup slightly into the first cut of the right rough. He'll have a some sort of wedge to a back-right hole location.3:50: Tiger's tee shot was tracking on the par-3 16th, but it comes up about 30 feet short. From there, he two-putts for par to remain at two under. Justin Thomas makes his 10-foot birdie effort to move to four under, while Rory McIlroy remains at one over. McIlroy hast two holes to avert his first over-par score of 2019.3:40: After another great drive and a solid approach, Woods races his birdie attempt nearly five feet past the hole. But he keeps the overall positive momentum going by converting the par putt to remain at two under. Tiger has three more holes to play. At least, before he gets a lunch break.3:24: BANG! There's the bounce back from Tiger. It just came one hole later. And from farther away as Woods drains his 12-footer for birdie on No. 14.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096507996031467520Woods is now back to two under, five shots behind Jordan Spieth, who has to be pleased to still be in front by two despite these soft conditions.3:17: Tiger hits a great shot on the difficult par-3 14th hole to about 15 feet. He'll have a good look at birdie coming up. In the meantime, here's a look at how the leader board stands with Jordan Spieth still leading the way.Jordan Spieth (-7) 2t. Tony Finau (-5) 2t. Patrick Rodgers (-5) 2t. Kramer Hickok (-5) 2t. Davis Love III (-5) 2t. Adam Scott (-5) 2t. J.B. Homes (-5)Click here for full scores.3:13: Woods stuck his approach to about four feet below the hole on No. 13. A bounce back birdie looked like a forgone conclusion until he pushed his effort. Woof. That's two three-putts and two short misses on the greens for Tiger today. He remains at one under. Meanwhile, Rory McIlroy, after getting to two under through eight, has fallen to one over after back-to-back bogeys. Justin Thomas, the third player in the group, continues to lead this trio at three under.3:05: After hitting fade after fade, Woods steps to the 13th tee and rips a draw around the corner, perfectly setting up his next shot. Good to see him working it both ways with ease.3:01: Tiger pushed his tee shot into the right rough, then hit a fantastic recovery shot from a thick lie onto the green. He had a long look at birdie that rolled about four feet past, leaving him with a tricky left-to-right par putt, which he missed. That's three three putts on the day for Woods, and he's still one under.2:39: Not the best chip from Woods, as he left himself about six feet for birdie, but he makes it anyway. Four straight for Tiger to get to two under for the day.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10964952191957975042:30: Woods rips a 3-wood from 269 to just in front of the green. Hate to jinx him, but there's no reason he shouldn't easily make his fourth straight birdie here (ducks).2:20: Three in a row for Woods as he rolls in another at No. 10 and moves to one under. If he finds the fairway again at the 11th, four in a row will be in his sights. Meanwhile, Rory makes his par to stay at one under and JT ends up holing his 10 footer for birdie to get to four under. Finally a little bit of JUICE from this threesome.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096489287753711616https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096489787672780800By the way, it looks like we know when they'll be heading back out for round two later today. Here's an update from the Tiger Tracker:https://twitter.com/GCTigerTracker/status/1096481806067523585That should give them enough time to get at least 11 or 12 holes in.At the 11th, Woods stripes another drive down the fairway. He's really starting to cook.2:12: Tiger's shot was a tad more difficult than we thought, as he had to avoid a bunker and take it up high to get it back to the pin. He was successful, sticking it to about three feet. Hell of a shot. Even better was Rory's shot, as he flopped it from a nice lie and got it to hang on just off the back of the green and stay out of the back bunker. Thomas, who had the easiest shot, put too much spin on his chip, leaving himself with about 10 feet for birdie.2:07: Finally, Tiger, Rory and JT hit their tee shots, and it looks like the ensuing entertainment will be well worth the wait. Tiger is in the collection area left of the green, where he has a straightforward chip that should set him up with a good chance to make birdie. Thomas is just in front of the green, and he'll have a great chance to make a birdie as well. Rory ... um ... not so much. He's in the rough with a greenside bunker in front of him and a pin he won't be able to get close to, and just holding the green would be a miracle.1:52: Woods drains his four-footer for bird and turns in even par 35. Real strong finish to his opening nine, and now it looks like he'll have a long wait at the 10th. DeChambeau, Kuchar and Rahm have still yet to hit their tee shots.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10964831254067896321:47: Tiger had just 122 left to the green and stuck one in there close. He has four feet left for birdie to turn in even par, which would be a small victory after that ugly three putt back at No. 7. Not to mention he'll have a prime opportunity to get into red figures at the driveable par-4 10th.1:41: Woods cranks another high fade right down the middle with the driver at No. 9. With the tees up today, he'll have a low iron in his hand for his approach.1:34: And he's on the board! Woods bounces back with a birdie putt from 15 feet, getting him back to one over. We'll see if that gets him going before making the turn.1:30: From 125 yards out, Woods hit a wedge and hated it from the second he made contact. While he did pull it, he's still hole high and inside 20 feet. Hideki Matsuyama-esque move from Tiger.1:24: Woods rips one right down the middle at the par-4 eighth. Should have a short iron in.1:15: Tiger's birdie putt was actually from just off the green on the fringe, and he rolled it by some four feet. Then, he missed the comebacker for par, dropping to two over on the day. Oof.1:09: Fairway and a green for Woods at the seventh. Good look at birdie coming up to get back to level par.12:58: Another hole, another par for Woods, who two-putted from 24 feet on the par-3 sixth. In the group up ahead, though, Jon Rahm is making a move at three under through six.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/109646557828021452912:47: Another meh hole for Tiger on No. 5, just missing the fairway with his tee shot, finding the front of the green with a so-so approach, and two-putting for another par from 43 feet. Woods remains at one over through five holes while his playing partners, McIlroy and Thomas, both remain at one under.12:42: As Matt Kuchar's ball is in the air on the par-3 sixth, a fan yells, \"Go low—just not with the gratuity!\" Despite Matt maintaining this is \"not a story,\" it is. And this won't be the last comment like this.12:29: Woods hit a nice shot to about 15 feet on the par-3 fourth, but ran his birdie effort by the hole. Still one over. Still no highlights. At least, from Tiger. Here was Spieth's closing birdie from about an hour ago, because there is not much else exciting going on right now.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/109644546143346688112:17: Another missed fairway and another short approach from Tiger on the par-4 third. Although, Woods found the putting surface, he was unable to two-putt from 63 feet, missing a seven-footer for par after badly misreading his first putt. That drops Tiger to one over through three holes. Not a lot of highlights so far. . .12:02: Tiger misses right off the tee on No. 2 then comes up short on another approach. But his pitch shot nearly goes down, leaving him with a tap-in par. Even par through two holes.11:49: After that perfect opening tee shot, Tiger hit a hideous approach with a 5-iron that came up way short in a fairway bunker. From there, he hit his third to 10 feet but missed the putt to walk away with a disappointing par. Both of Tiger's playing partners, McIlroy and Thomas, make birdie.11:38: Matt Kuchar just misses his eagle attempt from 25 feet on No. 1, but taps in for birdie. Kuchar has been in the news a lot this week over a caddie controversy dating back to his win at the Mayakoba Golf Classic. A controversy he didn't help with his comments on Wednesday. Is it possible some of those \"Kuuuuch\" shouts will turn to \"Mooooch\"? Kinda sounded like it on the first hole. . .11:34: Jordan Spieth is in with a seven-under-par 64 to take the early lead. Spieth needed only 21 putts during his bogey-free round. Of course, starting tournaments hasn't been a problem for Spieth of late. Finishing, however, has been a different story. Incredibly, Spieth is looking for his first win since the 2017 British Open and his first top 5 since last year's Masters.11:32: Woods smashes a driver off the first tee that finds the fairway. The opening par 5 at Riviera is essentially a long par 4 and one of the easiest holes on the PGA Tour all year so Tiger is thinking at least birdie after that tee shot.10:53: So far, so good on the Friday weather:https://twitter.com/GCTigerTracker/status/1096437235262533632And with lift, clean and place in play (for at least the first round), low scores are out there. Let's set the over/under on the Par-71 layout at 68.5.10:45: We are approximately 45 minutes away from Tiger's tee time and it's another major champ who is already off to a fantastic start. Jordan Spieth has the lead at six under through 15 holes. Spieth leads Patrick Rodgers by one and then there's a big group at four under, including Bill Haas, who is playing in the event a year after being involved in a car accident during last year's tournament that killed a friend he was staying with. Make sure you read Brian Wacker's piece from earlier in the week on how Haas is still trying to move on from that tragedy.10:35: As we move within an hour from Tiger teeing off, check out GOLFTV's latest behind-the-scenes video with Woods in which he says his bag has up to 16(!) golf gloves during rainy rounds and he explains why he doesn't like wearing rain jackets:https://twitter.com/GOLFTV/status/1096246456795697153\"Pops used to say, 'Once you're wet, you're wet.

Once he started running the front office, his blinking at Paul George on national TV contributed to the Lakers getting fined again for tampering. Johnson’s praise of Giannis Antetokounmpo drew yet another tampering fine.So, though he escaped punishment for his recent comments on 76ers guard Ben Simmons, Johnson refused to answer a question about Hornets guard Kemba Walker.Carolina Blitz:Asked Magic about Kemba and he said y’all aren’t going to catch him slipping anymore. pic.twitter.com/sQZtIWnQbn— Carolina Blitz (@KeepBlitzin) February 15, 2019Johnson:You know I can’t answer any questions about no players, because every time I do it, I get fined. But anybody else do it, they don’t get fined. So I’m going to stay away from that one.I don’t blame Johnson for feeling that way.Other teams’ owners, coaches and executives have repeatedly publicly discussed rival players without facing announced punishment.To be fair, the NBA doesn’t reveal every fine. Bucks owner Marc Lasry reportedly just got fined for tampering, but the league never announced it. But, at minimum, there’s an inconsistency with how the NBA exposes Johnson’s transgressions.Even NBA commissioner Adam Silver said last year there’s a spotlight on the Lakers due to prior tampering. That strikes me as unfair. The Lakers already paid for their prior violations and should now be held to the same standard as everyone else.And for what it’s worth, I wish that standard allowed an all-time great point guard like Johnson to publicly share his thoughts on Kemba Walker.Gareth Bale has landed himself in hot water after La Liga denounced the Real Madrid star for his celebration in the Madrid derby, which could carry a ban of four to 12 games.The Welsh forward scored as a substitute in the 3-1 victory over Atletico Madrid, bringing up his 100th goal for the club.And during the celebrations that followed, Bale \"lifted his right arm near his head in a clear sign of provocation towards the fans, then giving a gesture which could be seen as obscene and disdainful by folding his arm and striking it with his other hand.\"In a statement released by La Liga, Bale’s punishment will be decided by whether he incited the crowd or not.If Bale is guilty of “inciting opposition fans” to cause a hostile reaction, the punishment could carry four to 12 games, if there was no hostile reaction but intent, then it could be as little as one to three games.The gesture is referred to in Spain as ‘corte de mangas,’ with the moment not picked up in the referee’s match report.A committee will now decide whether the gesture merits a punishment.Bale also featured in Real’s Champions League victory over Ajax.Los Blancos take a 2-1 lead back to the Bernabeu for the second leg of the last 16 tie after Marco Asensio’s late winner.Earlier this week Heisman Trophy winner — and first round draft pick of the Oakland Athletics — Kyler Murray chose football over baseball, committing himself to the NFL draft.

In the last month alone he's won his 44th PGA Tour event, finished second in another, hit every fairway in a round for the first time in 21 years, shot a 60, pulled off this impossible recovery shot, gone viral just by rolling his eyes and said he might drop the Players from his schedule because he's already won it (a literal mic drop). The man simply cannot be stopped right now.Leave it to the weather to literally rain on Lefty's parade. On Thursday at the Genesis Open, Mickelson began his first round at the difficult short par-4 10th and drove into one of the bunkers up near the green, leaving him with a dreaded lengthy sand shot. He wound up hitting it over the green, and his ball plugged in the back bunker, setting up an even harder shot than he just had. As you'll hear PGA Tour Live commentator Shane Bacon say, avoiding making a six was probably the goal, but after Mickelson hit his third into another bunker on the other side of the green, a six suddenly became best-case scenario. How does a four sound instead?https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096076528142626818Find us a more Phil Mickelson par ever... you can't. He's always got a flair for the dramatic. The problem?

(Old man golfers)The dust is barely settled in the wake of the end of the Markelle Fultz era in Philadelphia, and the former 76ers guard is already taking shots at his old team.His old coach Brett Brown in particular.Fultz had his introductory press conference with the Orlando Magic on Thursday after being traded at last week’s deadline and praised his new coach Steve Clifford while taking a veiled shot at Brown.“It just excites me to know that I have a coach that’s going to push you to be better and not just going to tell you what you want to hear,” Fultz said.That’s direct praise for his new coach. But the message for Brown is clear. Fultz didn’t like what he heard from the Philadelphia coaching staff.Fultz never had any public dispute with the 76ers, but it was evident that he and the team had different approaches to the struggles that saw him shoot 41.4 percent from the field, 26.7 percent from 3-point distance and 53.4 percent from the line in limited action after being selected as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2017 draft.It’s still not clear whether injury or a mental block – or both – are the cause of his shooting issues.After his agent announced that the nerve disorder thoracic outlet syndrome was the root of the shooting woes, Fultz never played again for the 76ers.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]Fultz appears to be fully embracing the fresh start in Orlando as a player and a person.“I think the biggest thing we talked about what doing thing the right way,” Fultz said. “Just building me up both as a man and on the court.

Two things I really want to do is be the best player I can be and be the best young man I can be.”Fultz described the experience of his nerve disorder to reporters.“It’s hard to lift up your arms, you lose feeling in your fingers,” Fultz said. “You can’t tell when it’s going to happen. It’s not like you do the same motion every time. You get tingling in your fingers, numbness. Stuff like that.”He also curtly dismissed any notion that his shooting struggles are due to anything but injury.“I had an injury,” Fultz said. “I was out there trying to play through that. I never lost confidence.”Asked about a timetable to return, Fultz dodged the question to talk about rehab.“Right now it’s just about getting everything the right way,” he said. “Rehab’s been going great. I’m just taking my time and doing everything the right way.”More from Yahoo Sports: • PGA Tour pro defends paying caddie $5K on $1.3M win • NFL bars NCAA’s all-time sack leader from combine • Only one NBA team failed to scout Antetokounmpo • Black History honor for Kaepernick sacked by lawmakers He might not be well known to NFL fans at large, but New England Patriots fans know linebacker Kyle Van Noy — acquired basically for free from the Detroit Lions at the 2016 trade deadline — has been a big part of the defense the last two years, and has a knack for making plays at the right time.Van Noy is getting a little shine after winning his second Super Bowl ring with New England, appearing on the “Pardon My Take” podcast on Thursday to dish on all things Patriots and Super Bowl LIII.One thing that Van Noy revealed: the Los Angeles Rams didn’t do anything surprising during the game on offense.“I couldn’t believe that,” Van Noy said. “They really didn’t do — not one wrinkle. I was like, ‘What the hell?’ They’ve got so many good players, they’ve got so many things they’ve done all year, and the one play they gave us which was a wrinkle was the [Brandin] Cooks screen that hit for a little bit.“And that was it… Or maybe too, we were playing so good they were like, ‘[Expletive], we don’t know what to do.’ ”Hindsight, of course, is 20-20, but given that the Patriots’ coaching staff is known for having its players prepared for any and everything, it seems unwise that Los Angeles didn’t add some new plays or looks to try to stump New England.Van Noy said the Patriots’ culture, specifically coach Bill Belichick’s practice of not sparing anyone in the film room, even Tom Brady, is part of why the team continues to win.“Oh yeah. Yeah, that [stuff is] sick, to be honest, because it sets the table,” Van Noy said. “Like, OK, it doesn’t matter who you are, everyone’s on an even playing field. This is how it is here at work. You come in and you earn everything.“And I respect that because I felt like that gave me a chance to get on the field when I came in mid-year, and [Belichick] was like, ‘It doesn’t matter who you are or what you’ve done. You earn your keep.’ ”More from Yahoo Sports: • Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight The Brady Conundrum: How do you go about replacing the GOAT? originally appeared on nbcsportsboston.comThe Patriots hatched a Tom Brady succession plan after the 2013 season when they drafted Jimmy Garoppolo.Brady blew that up.Now, five years, four Super Bowl appearances, three Super Bowl wins, two Super Bowl MVPs and a regular-season MVP later, it's time to gingerly -- caaaauuuuuutiooooousssssllllyyyyy -- begin the process again.This time should be different.Even though Brady's contract hasn't been extended past the 2019 season, the love and happiness we saw on the field after the Rams were dispatched in SB53 is a good sign.MORE PATRIOTSAreas of Change: Will Pats be able to retain free agents Trey Flowers and Trent Brown?Brady's wariness about the Patriots' plans for him, and Bill Belichick's wariness about wedding his team to a quarterback who's closer to 50 years old than he is to 30, has dissipated.Once a new deal is in place -- Jonathan Kraft indicated that might be before training camp, though as of the Super Bowl conversations hadn't started -- Brady will have a written assurance that he will leave the Patriots and the NFL on his terms.That wasn't the case in early 2014 when the soon-to-be-37-year-old Brady saw the Patriots spend a first-round pick on a defensive tackle (Dominique Easley) and their second-rounder on Garoppolo. That, after a '13 season Brady spent throwing to the likes of Aaron Dobson, Josh Boyce, Kenbrell Thompkins and Austin Collie.Garoppolo was a stick of dynamite under Brady's behind. He was the existential threat Brady feared made flesh.Jimmy might have thought he was drafted to learn how to play quarterback in the NFL and have a nice career. To Brady, Garoppolo was there to take his job, throw his career into upheaval, uproot his family and see Brady cast out into the NFL wilderness.MORE PATRIOTSPerry: If Beckham is on the trade block, should Patriots be willing to pay the price?And, in contrast to the guy Brady succeeded in 2001 (and, by extension, did all those things to), Brady wasn't going to snort derisively at the plucky little draft pick here to take his job. He would crush the threat.He did.Brady played so well that -- despite Garoppolo developing into a bona-fide front-line quarterback under Belichick and Josh McDaniels (and Brady) -- Brady left the ever-prepared Patriots with no recourse when Garoppolo's contract was about to expire.Brady was too good to bench and too important to trade. Garoppolo was too expensive to franchise and too smart to take a \"bridge\" contract so he could watch Brady from the sidelines while his own hair started to gray at the temples. So off he went around Halloween, 2017.A lot's happened in the 16 months since.MORE PATRIOTSPhil Perry's Mock Draft 1.0: Pats start looking for Gronk's replacementBut now here we are, in the offseason of Brady's 42nd year. And the complex question of how to find the player who will eventually replace the greatest quarterback in NFL history still lingers.Do you draft his successor? If you do, do you do it this year? Do you do it next year?Do you try to get into the top 10 to get your pick of the litter? Do you stay put, confident that the muttonheads across the league will miss out as they did with Brady and Garoppolo (or Aaron Rodgers, Russell Wilson, Drew Brees, Brett Favre, Johnny Unitas . . . you get the point)? How much will it cost to get into the top 10? Do you package picks from this season -- when you will have six in the first three rounds -- and pick a sucker who will suck next year and fleece them for their 2020 first-rounder? How high do you have to go for a blue-chip, given the number of first-round quarterbacks that will be taken this year and that were taken in 2018?Is it a trade for somebody another team's given up on or has no work for, like San Francisco's Nick Mullens? A veteran who will hit free agency like Nick Foles, Case Keenum or Teddy Bridgewater?How does the successor play the position? Similar to Brady in that brain/eyes/accuracy/commitment trumps legs/arm strength/versatility?MORE PATRIOTSShould Pats be interested in Demaryius Thomas? No . . . and yesOr is there an embrace of the fact that trying to find a quarterback similar to a guy who came into the league after four years at Michigan at the end of last century with a once-in-a-lifetime work ethic is a pipe dream?Aside from who the successor is and how he plays, can Brady -- the lion in winter -- be tapped to help groom whoever is being brought aboard to take over?Brady -- contrary to sexed-up speculation -- didn't actively undermine Garoppolo at any point. They were teammates. He helped Garoppolo play the position better. They became close. But he wasn't quite showing him his world, either. Brady is famous for saying he's not giving away his secrets to younger quarterbacks until after he's done.With the end-date likely to be agreed upon when he signs an extension, does he become more a mentor so that the success of the franchise has a better chance to continue after he leaves? Would the Patriots want him to do that?Or would they want a blank(ish) slate to work with that isn't saying, \"But Tom said . . . \" when they try to shape him to succeed?And that contract? What's it look like? Does Brady demand pay commensurate with what he's accomplished? Is he in the mood to do the team another financial solid given the only bump they have him in 2018 was incentives he never reached? How does that impact the structure of the team?These questions aren't new. What is new is the level of angst and anxiousness. It's dissipated tremendously.That won't make finding his replacement or choosing the means by which the Patriots will do it any easier. But it's less fraught now.The irony is, the Patriots already successfully found Brady's successor. It's just that 2014 was too soon to go looking for him.Now, can they do it again?Click here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!

Before the team's loss to the Blazers on Wednesday night, he told ESPN that he \"wants to finish his career as a Warrior.\"      View this post on Instagram    Klay wants to stay in The Bay.A post shared by  espn (@espn) on Feb 13, 2019 at 9:23pm PSTThompson is set to be an unrestricted free agent at the end of the 2018-19 season.This isn't the first time Klay has made his feelings known. Even his father Mychal, who played five seasons for the Lakers, believes his son will re-sign with the Warriors. [RELATED: For Steve Kerr, Steph Curry and Klay Thompson are mix of NBA past and present]The Warriors selected Thompson with the No. 11 overall pick in the 2011 NBA Draft. Since then, he's been a five-time NBA All-Star, three-time Finals champion and two-time All-NBA selection. Anything could happen, but it's safe to say the Klay and the Dubs have quite the relationship and are ready to tie the knot.Jason Witten never worked with Kellen Moore as a coach, but he did practice with Moore when both of them were still active players with the Cowboys.That experience is enough for Witten to think Moore has “a way about him” that will pay off in his new job as the Cowboys offensive coordinator. Witten said this week that he believes Moore will be innovative and that the offense will take a “big step” by gearing things around quarterback Dak Prescott.“Yeah, I think he will do the things that Dak likes to do,” Witten said, via the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. “He will do the things they have to do to win. That is the way they have to play. I think they will use the pass to set up the run. Not just the run to set up the pass. I think he will add some nice wrinkles to that offense.”With head coach Jason Garrett coaching in the final year of his contract, Moore’s work with the offense will have a lot to do with how Dallas does in 2019 and with the path the team charts in the years that follow. If Witten’s correct, that path will probably look a lot like the one they’ve been on for a while.The story of Danny Ainge's Greece visit to watch Giannis Antetokounmpo is a wild one originally appeared on nbcsportsboston.comThe Boston Celtics took an early interest in Greece basketball star Giannis Antetokounmpo before he was selected in the 2013 NBA Draft.C's president of basketball operations Danny Ainge actually went over to Europe to watch Antetokounmpo play, and the postgame scene was nothing short of crazy.Fans were going wild, and some of them even yelled at Ainge because they thought he was associated with Antetokounmpo's team -- Ainge was sitting near its bench during the game.Check out the video below to hear the wild story of Ainge's scouting visit to Greece:Time for another \"Finding Giannis\" outtake. The first NBA team to scout Giannis was the Boston Celtics. As is often the case in Greece, hilarity ensued, as told by @GrgpanouOCT about Danny Ainge's visit. #FindingGiannis will be broadcasted Saturday on TNT at 630pm EST. pic.twitter.com/8bLjIjHv77— Jonathan Givony (@DraftExpress) February 14, 2019The Celtics liked what they saw from Antetokounmpo, but they decided to take Gonzaga forward/center Kelly Olynyk with their 2013 first-round pick instead. The C's made a trade with the Dallas Mavericks (who owned the No. 13 pick) to select Olynyk, whose ability to handle the ball and shoot well from the outside as a big man was appealing.Antetokounmpo ultimately was taken by the Milwaukee Bucks with the 15th pick. The \"Greek Freak\" has since become one of the league's best players and arguably is the leading candidate for MVP this season. It's still hard to fault Ainge and other executives for passing on Antetokounmpo, though. He was a very raw talent, and other players in that draft class were expected to provide more immediate contributions.Click here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!

They run the same plays over and over again. All they do is flop and shoot free throws. Maybe they’re even ruining basketball. Who isn’t these days, right?Houston’s offense operates with rigid discipline. The Rockets run and run James Harden off screens until he finds a tenable matchup to exploit. Tenable, so we’re clear, is a loosely defined term for a player who only needs a sliver of space to shoot from anywhere on the floor, whose combined ball-handling and strength psychs out defenders and referees alike.It is repetitive, sure, but in a way that’s endlessly fascinating. The Rockets repeatedly put the ball in the hands of the one of the NBA’s most creative, destructive scorers and wait for him to find a sieve — or create one. Harden now holds the second-longest 30-point scoring streak in NBA history, breaking 31 games in Wednesday night’s loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves, and he’s averaging a league-scorching 36.5 points per game.I’d argue all that makes the Rockets more watchable than most teams, which dilly-dally for possessions at a time, only looking to optimize in the face of urgency. You won’t find any freewheeling action from Iguodala-types in Houston. Even Austin Rivers has (mostly) held himself in check. Every time I turn on a Rockets game, Harden or Chris Paul has possession of the ball and is on the cusp of doing something. The game becomes a successive highlight reel that doesn’t allow you to turn the dial.The same quality that makes the Rockets so entertaining right now — and will likely garner Harden a second MVP — might be what hurts them in the playoffs again. The fuse is burning bright: Harden holds the ball an average of 9.6 seconds when he touches it, the highest mark in the NBA. His usage rate is 39 percent, smashing second place by 7 percent. What Harden’s doing might not be the best idea for the Rockets’ future outlook.But it’s definitely not boring. Even on defense, an opponent can make a name for himself with a signature moment against Harden — just ask Josh Okogie.As for as Harden’s high free-throw attempts bogging the game down, I won’t be convinced that a generation that cuts away to their iPhone screen 50 times per day is that bothered by an opportunity to look away from the action. When Harden’s playing, it’s the only chance you’re going to get.Because it seems like it, at least in the East. For the past few weeks, the dominant Warriors storyline has been about how Kevin Durant’s impending free agency could impact their title run. After a win against the Utah Jazz two nights ago, Durant said he feels the team is not playing well. These are the same Warriors, mind you, who are 16-3 since the New Year. Not only have they won all 11 games DeMarcus Cousins has played in — they’ve blown the tops off buildings, outscoring opponents by 9.7 points per 100 possessions. Until July 1, Warriors inevitability reigns.Why is it, then, that the Eastern Conference is littered with high-end teams that made big bets on winning this year? The Boston Celtics made their bed a while ago, with Kyrie Irving’s contract expiring when the season ends. The Toronto Raptors traded franchise cornerstone DeMar DeRozan for a chance to woo Kawhi Leonard for a season. Then they doubled down by trading for Marc Gasol. In sum, the 76ers exchanged Jerryd Bayless, Robert Covington, Dario Saric, Wilson Chandler, Mike Muscala, Landry Shamet, two first-round picks and two second-round picks for Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris, a pair of stars with deals that expire at the end of the year.(Side note: At least one of these three teams has to flame out in the second round. And then what does it do? For once, the playoff drama will be in the East, if not the title.)Could it be possible that the Warriors are so dominant that they’ve convinced the rest of the NBA to change the goalposts of ultimate success? Because as it stands right now, we’ve got a set of teams that went all in on trying to get to second place. It feels more like they’re auditioning for a post-Warriors future than trying to succeed in the current landscape. Even in a world where success is narrowly defined by wins and losses, perception is everything. And some things are inherent: If the rest of the NBA can’t compete against the Warriors, they still can’t help but compete against themselves.The aftermath of the most emboldened trade request in recent NBA history has been ugly. Anthony Davis is not a Laker — or a Knick or a Celtic or a Buck for that matter. And the New Orleans Pelicans don’t seem to have much use for him either. They’d rather sit him and pile up losses, focus on the lottery race and protect Davis’ health so they can trade him in the offseason. But the NBA issued a directive: The Pelicans would be fined $100,000 for every game he sat.So it is that after playing well enough to keep the Pelicans in it, Davis was benched in the fourth quarter two games in a row. Then, against the Orlando Magic, they got blown out by 30 points, which led to Davis — chef’s kiss — criticizing the team’s effort. So things aren’t good. What’s worse: It doesn’t seem like they’re going to get any better.Thanks to the NBA’s orders, this is the only reasonable compromise for both the Pelicans and Davis. He gets to pervert his livelihood — surely important to a man who has spent so many days involuntarily sidelined by injuries — while the Pelicans at least get to lose some of the time.Here’s what it comes down to: The NBA can’t make a decision that weighs the Pelicans real interests, because it can’t be so blithely rational about what’s best for them, which is tanking. In an alternate universe with no draft lottery, the Pelicans might at least be incentivized to let Davis play when it matters to get fans in seats. But the league won’t acknowledge its worst kept secret, so a dysfunctional situation is primed to only get worse.Nothing like the 76ers to get the Boston Celtics going. And nothing like a loss to the Celtics on Tuesday night to spread anxiety in the lives of 76ers fans.Despite the addition of Tobias Harris, the 76ers lost to the Kyrie-less Celtics in the same ways they’ve habitually lost to them: The Celtics stuck like glue to the few shooters the 76ers play at the same time and treated Ben Simmons like a non-entity, while Al Horford ate Joel Embiid’s lunch. The Sixers couldn’t protect the perimeter on the other end, so they never got much of a chance to get out in transition.I won’t write them off as quickly as I did after Christmas, if only because Harris is the type of sharpshooter who could tip the scales in favor of an old-school style — if they’re willing to embrace it.Since trading for Jimmy Butler in November, the Sixers are seventh in pace, 11th in defense and 16th in offensive rebounding. This is a team with three starters who are above 6-foot-8, including the league’s most imposing center since Shaq, but it’s stuck in the middle because it’s trying to fit old-school parts into a new-school game. The league has been crashing full-tilt into more space and pace for years, so you can forgive the Sixers for trying, but you don’t win championships by playing against your strengths.Philadelphia should be slow, plodding, muscly and mean. It should crash the glass with impunity, hunt cross-matches with pick-and-rolls and bully defenders in the post. The mere idea of entering the paint against the 76ers should make opponents cower with fear.The only rub is that slowing it down doesn’t serve Ben Simmons’ style, but they’re going to have to figure out the inevitable tension between his transition-happy game and Embiid’s half-court dominance eventually. Better to do it while playing to your strengths and find out if it works now, instead of two years down the road.Following Jeremy Lin’s first game as a Raptor, he took to the podium and shared some interesting thoughts on the presence of the international media. Here are some snippets, from the Toronto Star:“Yeah, [Mandarin media] probably happens in every city that has a strong Asian contingent,” Lin said. “Happened in Atlanta as well, but not this. So again, I’m very proud to represent Asian people on a global platform, on a global scale. And for me to be here where there’s a lot of Asians, like, I used to run from it, you know?“Because that’s all anybody’s ever wanted to look for. Like, ‘Oh, he’s Asian, he’s Asian, he’s Asian.’ And I was like, talk about my basketball. But now people can see I can play, I belong in the NBA, and I’ve really embraced just being able to represent Asians and do it the right way, hopefully.“Yeah, I mean, I think I was really jaded after the New York stretch,” Lin continued. “I think there was a lot of things that happened that made me give up a little bit on people, per se. And that was a huge part of the story, and that was a huge point of contention for a lot of people as to why I was getting the publicity, or why things were the way they were.“So I kind of wanted to run from that a little bit. I would probably say three years down the road, I kind of turned a corner, and I would say being hurt for two straight years, and seeing that my Asian fan base, I don’t feel like it dropped off one bit. And I haven’t even touched the court. Like, every year I go over to Asia and I can’t even walk through the airport — it’s insane. So to see them do that after all the highs and lows, but really going through the lows post-Linsanity, which culminated in those injuries, for me, I’m still blown away. And again, that’s fed into why I want to carry myself a certain way.”I don’t have a lot to say here, except that it’s touching to see a man whose identity was leveraged and controlled by outside forces for so long get to stop running away from how he’s perceived and finally be himself: an NBA player who once turned the basketball universe on its head, an Asian-American, a God-fearing Harvard grad. He has lived long enough in the public eye that the public has finally accepted what they originally thought were contradictory traits. That, friends, is how stereotypes are broken.More from Yahoo Sports:• PGA Tour pro defends paying caddie $5K on $1.3M win • NFL bars NCAA’s all-time sack leader from combine • Only one NBA team failed to scout Antetokounmpo • Black History honor for Kaepernick sacked by lawmakers Isaiah Thomas gets standing ovation, drills 3-pointer in Nuggets debut originally appeared on nbcsportsboston.comBrad Stevens could have begun his All-Star vacation Wednesday night after the Boston Celtics defeated the Detroit Pistons.But Stevens had a Denver Nuggets game to catch.The Celtics head coach set his DVR for Nuggets-Sacramento Kings to watch his former star player, Isaiah Thomas, make his Denver debut after a lengthy absence caused by offseason hip surgery.Thomas didn't disappoint.

At least, maybe you do when you’re Keith Tkachuk, and you’ve raised two true hockey ragamuffins in Brady Tkachuk and Matthew Tkachuk. Chances are, Keith’s probably more preoccupied with getting his sons not to obnoxiously dangle their mouthpieces out of their mouths.(And, yeah, maybe to make sure Matthew doesn’t get hosed on his second contract.)Anyway, Keith was on hand to see – and chuckle at – Brady, the younger of the two NHL Tkachuk kids, getting into a fight with Jonathan Ericsson of the Detroit Red Wings. It’s probably fair to say that Ericsson got the better of Brady, but judge for yourself in the video above this post’s headline, via Sportsnet.Judging by Hockey Fights’ listings, the family fight counts are now unofficially:Brady: Three. He’s a rookie, so he’s clearly endearing himself to opponents already.Matthew: Seven through three seasons.Keith: 51 fights during 1,201 regular-season and 89 playoff contests.Considering the temperaments of the Tkachuk brothers and father, chances are we’ll see more scuffles for both Brady and Matthew before they hopefully enjoy retirement as much as Keith seems to be enjoying it. And then there can be aggravating, skilled Tkachuk grandsons.—James O’Brien is a writer for Pro Hockey Talk on NBC Sports.

Yahoo Sports' Charles Robinson and Amanda Borges address the settlement between the players and the NFL, and what it means for their continuing efforts to promote social activism.The NBA jerseys of the future have a new feature to them: the ability to customize them after purchase by changing the name and number.In an awkward reveal reminiscent of a tech presentation, NBA commissioner Adam Silver and sportscaster Ahmad Rashad demonstrated the jersey at the NBA Tech Summit on Friday ahead of All-Star Weekend in Charlotte, switching a No. 30 Stephen Curry jersey to No. 23 Michael Jordan threads.Adam Silver just revealed the NBA jersey of the future that changes the name and number 🤯(via @NBA)pic.twitter.com/cgJk7KcIIU— Yahoo Sports (@YahooSports) February 15, 2019If Silver is trying to pull a Steve Jobs, perhaps he should stick to his day job. But in all seriousness, the jersey presents some interesting questions: Will it be easier for fans to “bandwagon”? Can players switch jerseys mid-game? Will Drake be first in line for this new prop?Meanwhile, Twitter had all of the jokes.Jersey cost only 20 easy installments of, $999.99.— Vod Kanockers (@JHoward2716) February 15, 2019Kevin Durant can now switch teams mid game with these new #NBA jerseys 😳 pic.twitter.com/a01rMkiexr— OT Sports Podcast Network (@OTSportsPod) February 15, 2019This could go one of two ways: Either the NBA will have found another way to separate itself from the other sports leagues or it will be a pointless feature that exists just because there is the technology to make it happen and for Twitter to crack jokes. In any case, you have to admit the NBA never fails to entertain.More from Yahoo Sports: • Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight When spring training camps opened this week around Major League Baseball, it brought hope that maybe, finally, Bryce Harper and Manny Machado would sign with teams and baseball’s long free-agent freeze would melt away.Nope. Not yet. Not only has that not happened, something else did happen: a number of talented young players around the league have agreed to team-friendly contract extensions.The latest was New York Yankees ace Luis Severino, who on Friday reportedly agreed to a four-year, $40 million deal. The deal, first reported by Joel Sherman of the New York Post, would buy up Severino’s arbitration years and comes with a $15 million club option for his first year of free agency.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]By agreeing to this deal, the Yankees and Severino avoid arbitration for 2019. He’ll make $4 million this season, $10 million next, then $10.25 million in 2021 and $11 million in 2022. The club option is for 2023. In the grand scheme of society, this is a very generous contract. In baseball’s economic bubble, it’s another young player signing for below-market value relative to his skills and potential.It’s hard to blame Severino for taking the deal, looking around at a free-agent world where Harper and Machado are still available, as are Dallas Keuchel and Craig Kimbrel. Especially since we haven’t heard even slight grumblings about teams being interested in Keuchel and Kimbrel.Coming off a breakout season in which he went 19-8 with a 3.39 ERA, the 25-year-old Severino was given a deal that’s pretty hard to turn down: “Do you want $40 million guaranteed, yes or no?”The other players faced with a similar question this week were Philadelphia Phillies ace Aaron Nola, who said yes to a four-year, $45 million deal Wednesday. It also avoided arbitration and bought out two of Nola’s free agency years, making it the most below-market deal of any of these.The Minnesota Twins locked up two of their talented young players Thursday, as right fielder Max Kepler agreed to a five-year, $35 million deal with a $10 million club option for 2024. It buys out three years of free agency for Kepler, 26. Shortstop Jorge Polanco also agreed to a five-year extension, his is worth $25.75 million with two option years that could keep him in Minnesota through 2025.In a vacuum, these types of extensions look like win-wins: The players get guaranteed money as they’re coming off good seasons. The clubs get cost-certainty to help them navigate the future — whether it’s the Yankees and Phillies trying to add big free agents this year or next, or a team like the Twins striving for contention with a homegrown core.In a bigger sense, though, it’s hard not to look at these deals in the current state of free agency and wonder if they’re a symptom of something else. Is it the market correcting itself? Is it baseball’s economy morphing into something new? Or maybe it’s just players looking around and saying, “Well, I better get my money now.”According to numerous reports, there’s a fear that for this generation of young players the light at the end of the tunnel — the big free-agency payday — won’t be there for them in the same way it was for so many other players.So while it’s great that stars like Justin Verlander, Clayton Kershaw and Max Scherzer are publicly speaking out about the current state of free agency, they’re on the right side of it. They got their mega deals.The younger players find themselves in a different sort of peril. It’s entirely possible that these are the biggest paydays these players ever get, which is a much different economic model that we’ve seen from baseball in the past.Whether it’s right or wrong — and that’s certainly something that’s up for debate heading into the next collective-bargaining agreement — baseball’s economy has often been backward. Players get paid less, relative to the market, in their pre-free agency years. The best recent example is Mike Trout winning the MVP in 2014 at age 22 while making $1 million.He got a raise to $6 million the next season, but in 2015 was still making a fraction of what people like Ryan Howard ($25M), Albert Pujols ($24M), Joe Mauer ($23M), Mark Teixeira ($22.5M) and Jose Reyes ($22M) were making.But that overpay is a necessary part baseball’s economic ecosystem too. It’s a fact: Players get overpaid as their careers decline. It’s almost like baseball’s way of making up for underpaying players during their early years. It’s baseball’s golden parachute. What’s happening these days is fewer teams are accepting that overpay as part of the how the system works.In the past few years, arbitration salaries have gotten higher and higher, and teams have tried harder to lock up younger stars before free agency. It’s why we’ve see players like Madison Bumgarner, Chris Archer, Chris Sale and Paul Goldschmidt become valuable trade chips for their team-friendly contract extensions.Teams are getting smarter about where their money goes, and how to keep value in their assets. These extensions to Severino, Nola and the rest show that they’re willing to spend money, just in the way that they want.Earlier this week, former Miami Marlins president David Samson tweeted something in response to Justin Verlander, saying the “broken system” talk was wrong. Players and their agents, Samson said, needed to adjust to a “new reality.”He may be right about the new reality part. The monster paydays at the end of the free agency tunnel could be fading away. If Bryce Harper and Manny Machado can’t get them, who can?The new reality could be players seizing their money. Whenever they can.– – – – – –Mike Oz is a writer at Yahoo Sports.

However, Wainwright framed the situation with a little more urgency on Friday by expressing concerns that a day of reckoning could happen sooner than later.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]Speaking to InsideSTL.com’s Tim McKernan, Wainwright said it was inevitable that the players will go on strike unless major changes are made to help bridge the widening gap. But he’s also worried that frustrations could reach a boiling point during the season leading to some form of a revolt. Perhaps even a mid-season walkout.#STLCards pitcher Adam Wainwright on @TMASTL: “Unless something changes, there’s going to be a strike. 100%. I’m just worried people are going to walk-out mid-season.” pic.twitter.com/M8WeRVcASe— Tim McKernan (@tmckernan) February 15, 2019“Unless something changes, there’s going to be a strike. 100%,” Wainwright said regarding the free-agent freeze that has left stars like Bryce Harper and Manny Machado without contracts. “I’m just worried people are going to walkout midseason.”It’s conceivable given the current climate, but a players revolt on that level still feels like a long shot. The target date we should all still be looking at is Dec. 1, 2021. That’s when the current collective bargaining agreement ends and the owners will be forced to come to the table.That doesn’t mean we should just dismiss Wainwright’s concerns about a 2019 strike. While they might feel a little on the dramatic side, the frustration that has built all offseason as dozens of free agents, including and especially Harper and Machado, remain unsigned is becoming more palpable by the day. There’s a genuine feeling that owners are determined to cut back on salaries even as profits continue to reach new heights, it’s possible the players’ patience will run out if the free-agent freeze continues to drag on. Wainwright thinks so, and he’s far from alone.In Friday’s interview, the 37-year-old right-hander also criticized owners and front offense personnel for placing too much emphasis on “analytics” and placing everything in a “sabermetric box” that discounts intangibles and other immeasurable aspects of baseball.Adam Wainwright said today on ⁦@TMASTL⁩ that he expects there to be a strike “100%.”The context of the conversation comes from a discussion on how Bryce Harper and Manny Machado are still without teams.You can see Wainwright’s reasoning in the video below. pic.twitter.com/GXsmx4cXk1— Tim McKernan (@tmckernan) February 15, 2019Wainwright admitted that there’s always risk in making long-term financial commitments to players, but emphasized that doing so marks a commitment to winning that several teams seemingly lack.“Part of it is smart from their side of it, but you have to realize it’s about winning. So, if Bryce Harper wants 10 years and he’s 26 years old. He’s going to be a dynamic player. The same can be said about Manny Machado. These guys are superstar players.”The deeper we get into it the more obvious it is that the players know what battles lie ahead. The only real question is how much worse it will get before any progress is made toward a satisfactory resolution.More from Yahoo Sports:• Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight MLB rumors: Bryce Harper has made his decision, says D.C. radio host originally appeared on nbcsportsbayarea.comA report has come out from the East Coast saying Bryce Harper has come to a decision on which team he will play for in 2019 and beyond.Chris Russell, a sports radio talk show host from 106.7 The Fan in Washington D.C., (who has been on the Harper beat for some time) said the free agent slugger could make a decision in the next 24 hours.\"Maybe I took a little bit of a leap of faith here based on some indications I got from a real good source,\" Russell told 94WIP, in Philadelphia, on Friday.\"Bryce and his representatives, (Scott) Boras, his people, his wife Kayla, they've been meeting since Monday morning in Vegas. Bryce originally wanted this done, when it took this long, by Valentine's Day. Obviously, the contract has not been announced, signed, or whatever.\"\"But I'm led to believe by the people that I've talked to that are close to the situation -- and I have, again, a real good source that has helped me through this process, let's just leave it at that,\" Russell said. \"That Bryce was in a mood to celebrate yesterday. Now, the source said, 'I believe it's done.' I don't have concrete, 100 percent proof for you guys. I wish I did, otherwise, I would have it and I would be running around with it. But I don't have that, so I want to caution everybody in Philadelphia. But that's what I was led to believe, that this thing is now decided.\"Russell then mentioned the Phillies.\"Now, what comes then is hammering out a contract. And if we were to believe the report that the Philadelphia Phillies had not even extended a formal offer -- and I assume that to be a termed, written agreement, that type of thing, which I find hard to believe -- then there might be more legwork to this. And therefore, hey the decision may be done, but the contract still needs to be ironed out.\"[RELATED: Phillies fan participates in \"lent\" in hopes of recruiting Harper]Russell is being safe with the terminology he's using, which is understandable. And while we haven't been able to confirm these rumors, Harper, along with many other free agents, remains unsigned.The Giants appeared to be the \"mystery team\" that introduced themselves late into the Harper sweepstakes -- and when the radio hosts asked Russell his opinion on where the outfielder will end up next season, he believed Harper will be in an orange and black uniform.\"I don't think it's going to be the Nationals,\" Russell said. \"I think it's going to be the San Francisco Giants, but that is not by any means an 'I know that for a fact,' so I want to caution everybody -- I know how this works -- I get in trouble with everything I say on my radio show, and everyone blows it up.\" The wait continues ... Golden State Warriors stars Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant empathised with Steve Kerr after the head coach was ejected during the loss to the Portland Trail Blazers having thrown a clipboard in response to a flagrant foul call.Kerr was enraged late in the fourth quarter when Draymond Green was called for a flagrant foul after he stopped Zach Collins from approaching the rim as he went up for a shot.That drew Kerr's ire and after ranting in one referee's face, he slammed a clipboard down to earn an ejection, with Durant having to escort his head coach back off the court.The Warriors lost the game 129-107 but will still head into the All-Star break with the best record in the Western Conference.\"It was an emotional game. We fought really hard for 43 minutes,\" Curry told reporters afterwards.\"One questionable decision - the flagrant - obviously the fire came out. You see coach go and throw a clipboard. At that point you try to get us over the hump. An eight-point swing, it's tough to overcome.\"\"I looked at the replay and the amount of ball [Green] got, there was nothing excessive about it, he got all the ball.\"There was a lot of chirping, with Zach involved. There was probably a sensitivity to it, trying to put out some fires, but I thought it was a terrible call. We obviously paid the price for it with how everything unfolded after that.\"Durant shared that sympathy having been the one to pull Kerr away from the referees as he continued to rant at them.\"I felt for him, I understand his anger and his rage, especially for that call,\" he said.\"I thought we should have just kept playing, It was a common foul, I thought. Refs looked at it differently. \"I understand why coach was a little frustrated.\"Kerr explained that it was the disbelief at the call that had triggered his reaction.\"I was just shocked that that was called a flagrant foul,\" he said. \"I'm not sure how it's determined - if it's in New York or the officials on the call - but that was head-scratching: that that could be called a flagrant foul.\"The guy's going to go in for a dunk, you've got to make sure he doesn't dunk it.\"So, I told Kenny [Mauer] that I beg to differ. There might have been a couple of other words in there too!\"I'll have to ask the owner if the clipboard broke when I threw it down. I got a little anger out so that was good. I was too busy yelling to ask for an explanation.\"Charles Barkley thinks New Orleans Pelicans star Anthony Davis made a mistake with his trade request.The 25-year-old asked the Pelicans to move him in late January and the Los Angeles Lakers had been engaged in discussions about acquiring him. But, no deal was reached before the deadline and Davis remained with New Orleans.Barkley, an 11-time All-Star who works as an analyst for TNT, said he thinks Davis and his agent, Rich Paul, mishandled the situation.\"Don't ruin your reputation as a great player, one of the nicest guys in the world,\" Barkley told reporters on Thursday ahead of All-Star weekend (via the Washington Post).\"Remember, your agent works for you, you don't work for him. They handled that situation wrong. It's going to come back to bite them in the a***. It's unfortunate.\"The six-time All-Star entered play on Thursday averaging 28.5 points and 13.1 rebounds this season. But, he scored just three points in 24 minutes on the floor in the Pelicans' 118-88 loss to the Orlando Magic earlier this week.\"This is a bad situation,\" Barkley said. \"It's a bad look for the NBA. Because that kid can't go out there and give 100 per cent because he’s worried about getting hurt. The guy's the second-best player in the world and he's got three points? That's not a good look for the NBA.\"The Boston Celtics and New York Knicks, among others, are expected to explore dealing for Davis after the season. Barkley, however, said he believes the forward will eventually land in Los Angeles because of Paul's relationship with Lakers star LeBron James.Barkley tallied 22.1 points and 11.7 rebounds per game over his 16-year career. He retired in 2000 and was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame six years later.After an apology from Sergio Garcia, a non-apology from Matt Kuchar, and an uncooperative Mother Nature on Valentine's Day, it's time for everyone to focus again on Tiger Woods. Kidding. Sort of. A weather-delayed first round at Riviera re-starts on Friday morning and the 14-time major champ will be in the Hollywood-area spotlight as he finally begins his Genesis Open. And golf fans could potentially see a LOT of the tournament host as the event tries to play catch up after heavy rains on Thursday.Woods, Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas (Decent group, eh?) are scheduled to tee off at 8:32 local time (11:32 ET). The hope is they will complete their first rounds and then play as much of their second rounds as possible before darkness. And Tiger's hope is to finally win for the first time at this historic layout where he missed the cut last year. We'll be tracking Tiger every step of the way so keep it right here for the latest scores, news and highlights. (All times eastern)SATURDAY, 11:25: With a 25-foot birdie putt on No. 9, Woods' final hole of the second round, Tiger will likely make the cut. The birdie brought Woods back to even on his round and to one under overall.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096808527694245890After resuming play in the morning, Woods bogeyed his first hole, No. 4, then made four pars before his finishing birdie. His playing partners, however, fared much better. Justin Thomas shares the lead with Adam Scott at 11 under and Rory McIlroy birdied four of his six holes on Saturday morning to shoot 63 and move to seven under through 36 holes. Thursday's early wave is now on the course for their second rounds.-------------------FRIDAY-------------------8:25: And with that, the horn has sounded—play will be suspended for darkness on Friday at Riviera. Tiger, JT and Rory have six more holes to complete their second round. Justin Thomas is at 10-under, tied with Adam Scott for the lead. Tiger will hope Saturday brings some different momentum for him—as this marathon day ends with two bogeys in a row after the highlight eagle.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10965708926692065298:21: That's back-to-back bogeys now for Tiger Woods, dropping another shot here at the third hole (his 12th of the round). And over his past six holes, Tiger has four bogeys. The birdie at No. 1 helped negate most of that damage ... but Tiger's back to 1-under again—right on the current cut line.8:13: On his 30th hole of the day, Tiger is showing some obvious signs of being tired. And who could blame him—he's been playing golf for nearly 10 hours straight. From 165 yards out at the third hole, Tiger Woods tries to chop out a 6-iron and comes out of it. His ball comes to rest short of the green. With sunset in Pacific Palisades being 5:30 local time, this group will have time for maybe one more hole today.8:04: Tiger follows up that eagle putt at No. 1 with a bogey at the second hole. The third bogey of his second round moves Tiger back to 2-under overall.7:56: After a long wait at the second hole, Tiger sprays his second shot from 235 out with a fairway wood out to the right. He'll have his work cut out from the front right bunker to save par at the 482-yard par 4.7:40: This is exactly what Tiger Woods needed: He rolls in his 43-foot eagle putt at his 10th hole (the first) to get back to 3-under—negating those two bogeys he made on his front nine. What a putt! With the flagstick in!https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096570892669206529Tiger made a disappointing par to open his first round earlier today at the first hole. The unlikely eagle makes up for that effort—and could turn around Tiger's second round in a dramatic way. Tiger goes from toeing the cut line at 1-under to now all of a sudden being T-21.7:28: Tiger finds the fairway at the par-5 first hole, the group's 10th hole of their second round, as he attempts to get a shot back here after bogeying two of his final three holes on his front nine. Neither bogey was particularly bad—the 18th hole is playing brutally tough right now uphill and into the wind with the rain, making it even more of a challenging hole. And his break at 16 was very unlucky.7:16: Tiger and JT are gonna have their work cut out to save par at the 18th hole (their ninth). Each player had fairway wood approaches and tried playing a big cut. JT was way up left on the hill—Tiger was closer. He went high with his approach and will have about 11 feet left for par.Tiger misses the par putt, so he'll drop a shot along with JT as they make the turn. Tiger moves back to 1-under after 27 holes. That's where the cut line currently is—so all of a sudden, Tiger must be concerned about making the cut.7:01: Following Justin Thomas throwing a dart at the 17th to about 3 feet, Tiger puts his wedge shot from under 100 yards to outside 20 feet, so he'll be disappointed with that effort. The birdie putt misses on the high side, and Tiger taps in for par to remain at 2-under. His playing partner and buddy Justin Thomas stays hot, rolling in a fourth straight birdie to get to 9-under—tied for the lead with Adam Scott. Really impressive golf here from JT.6:54: The rain is really coming down now as the players head to the 17th hole. Tiger finds the fairway at the par-5 17th hole, but it was a short one—he has 326 yards left. Most players have been laying up at this par 5 all day.6:43: From a brutal position up against the back lip of the bunker, Tiger hacks it out—and somehow keeps the ball on the green, albeit the back portion. His par attempt from 44 feet away here comes up three feet shy. Tiger makes his bogey to move back to 2-under.Meanwhile, Justin Thomas is officially on fire. He has another birdie after a fabulous tee shot at 16. It's now two Kentucky boys tied at the top: Justin Thomas and J.B. Holmes (-8).https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10965576791939317766:39: Tiger will have serious lie issues at the par-3 16th hole. His tee shot came to rest up against the back lip of the bunker. As Billy Kratzert just remarked on PGA Tour Live, Tiger will do well just to keep this ball on the green. Though he avoided dropping a shot on his last hole, there might be a bogey in his future here.6:35: A clutchhh par save by Tiger at the 15th hole makes up for his poor chip—and Tiger keeps the momentum going on his second round, as he stays 3-under for the tournament and 2-under on the round.Justin Thomas, also in Tiger's group, holed out from in front of the green for birdie at the 14th hole, and he makes a long birdie putt at 15 to get to 7-under—just one back of fellow Kentucky native J.B. Holmes.6:32: A poor chip shot from Tiger at the 15th hole leaves him about 13 feet away. He'll need to convert that putt to prevent dropping his first shot of his second round.6:24: Tiger finds another fairway here at Riviera, this one at the 15th hole. The guy is feeeling it with his driver. Almost on auto pilot. His approach from 190 out turns a little too much, finding the rough to the left of the green. He'll have to get up and down to avoid dropping one here.6:20: From 20 feet out, Tiger's birdie bid comes up shy—never really scaring the hole, despite getting a good look at the line from Rory's putt. Tiger taps in for par to remain at 3-under.The putter has been disappointing for Tiger all day: He had 34 putts in his first round, including four three-putts, just the third time in his career he's done that.6:13: Tiger puts his tee shot at the par-3 14th hole just inside Rory's ball—about 20 feet right of the hole. He'll get a little teach from Rory's putt, too, as Tiger continues to hit it well today.6:07: Tiger just misses the left-to-right curling bid for birdie, leaving himself with an easy par at 13. He stays 3-under for the tournament and -2 through four on his round.Tiger's playing partners are also playing well—Rory has three birdies in his first four holes to get to 2-under. Look out for Rory at rainy Riviera. And Justin Thomas, despite hitting his tee shot out of bounds at 13, got up and down from 160 yards to avoid dropping multiple shots. He's now 5-under after that bogey.6:02: Another grooved tee shot for Tiger Woods at the 13th hole puts him in good position. He turned over his tee shot—putting his draw in the middle of the fairway at the dogleg left. Tiger spins his approach back to about 15 feet, just off the green in the fringe. He'll have a chance to knock another one here and keep the momentum going.5:51: Bang! Tiger nails the 25-footer for birdie at the 12th hole to add a second birdie to his card through three holes. Realistically, too, it could be three straight birdies for Tiger. But the 14-time major champion is now 2-under through 3—T-3 for the tournament (T-19)—and carries some strong momentum on his side at the start of his second round ... as the rain is coming down at Riviera.5:46: Tiger hits his approach hole high—about 25 feet from 181 yards. He'll have another chance to add a birdie to his third round.Tiger's currently at 2-under, which puts him at T-29. The projected cut is at 1-under—so he's comfortably inside the number as of now. But there's a ton of golf to be played, obviously.5:41: Tiger finds the fairway with his driver at the par-4 12th hole. The 12th usually plays as one of the toughest holes at Riviera—we'll see if Tiger can take advantage of his position here in the fairway.5:33: An excellent fairway-wood second shot by Tiger put him right in front of the par-5 11th green in two. But a very poor approach putt for his third leaves him more than 10 feet away. His birdie try slides by for a very disappointing par being so close in 2. That should've been a golden opportunity to start his second round with two birdies—instead, Tiger stays at 2-under.5:12: Tiger goes high with his pitch—having to navigate around the front bunker, and plays it nicely—spinning it about 7 feet short of the hole. So Tiger will have a good look for an opening birdie to start his second round. Tiger converts the birdie putt to move to 2-under.5:02: Only a little more than a half hour after finishing his first round, Tiger Woods (-1) -- along with Justin Thomas (-5) and Rory McIlroy (+1) -- has teed off in his second round. The group started on the drivable 10th hole, and Tiger has driven his tee shot just off the green. He'll have a chance to put his pitch shot close to start his second round with a birdie.4:24: Tiger narrowly misses the birdie putt at the 18th hole, so he'll tap in for a par and an opening-round, one-under 70 at Riviera. Having three-putted for a fourth time on the 17th hole to drop a shot in disappointing fashion, Tiger will head to his second round a bit frustrated. But the four consecutive birdies showed him being able to score well at Riviera, where he has never won.Tiger, JT (who birdied 18 to finish at 5-under) and Rory will head right back for their second round in this marathon day for them.4:18: Tiger responds to that shocking three-putt with a perfect drive and a towering 6-iron on Riviera's famed 18th. Woods is in good shape to at least make par the difficult hole, but as we've seen all day, a two-putt is anything but automatic.Here's an unusual stat on Tiger three-putting four times this afternoon. He's making some history in a bad way...https://twitter.com/JustinRayGolf/status/10965196250582507574:06: So much for the momentum. . . After a decent approach shot that spins back to about 20 feet, Woods runs his birdie putt a couple feet by and. . . gulp. . . misses the comebacker from about two feet. Wow. That's four three-putts on the day as Tiger falls back to one under with one hole to play.3:57: Uh-oh, it's raining in southern California again. Meanwhile, Woods is plodding his way up the par-5 17th. After pulling his drive into the left rough and drawing a poor lie, Woods pushed his layup slightly into the first cut of the right rough. He'll have a some sort of wedge to a back-right hole location.3:50: Tiger's tee shot was tracking on the par-3 16th, but it comes up about 30 feet short. From there, he two-putts for par to remain at two under. Justin Thomas makes his 10-foot birdie effort to move to four under, while Rory McIlroy remains at one over. McIlroy hast two holes to avert his first over-par score of 2019.3:40: After another great drive and a solid approach, Woods races his birdie attempt nearly five feet past the hole. But he keeps the overall positive momentum going by converting the par putt to remain at two under. Tiger has three more holes to play. At least, before he gets a lunch break.3:24: BANG! There's the bounce back from Tiger. It just came one hole later. And from farther away as Woods drains his 12-footer for birdie on No. 14.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096507996031467520Woods is now back to two under, five shots behind Jordan Spieth, who has to be pleased to still be in front by two despite these soft conditions.3:17: Tiger hits a great shot on the difficult par-3 14th hole to about 15 feet. He'll have a good look at birdie coming up. In the meantime, here's a look at how the leader board stands with Jordan Spieth still leading the way.Jordan Spieth (-7) 2t. Tony Finau (-5) 2t. Patrick Rodgers (-5) 2t. Kramer Hickok (-5) 2t. Davis Love III (-5) 2t. Adam Scott (-5) 2t. J.B. Homes (-5)Click here for full scores.3:13: Woods stuck his approach to about four feet below the hole on No. 13. A bounce back birdie looked like a forgone conclusion until he pushed his effort. Woof. That's two three-putts and two short misses on the greens for Tiger today. He remains at one under. Meanwhile, Rory McIlroy, after getting to two under through eight, has fallen to one over after back-to-back bogeys. Justin Thomas, the third player in the group, continues to lead this trio at three under.3:05: After hitting fade after fade, Woods steps to the 13th tee and rips a draw around the corner, perfectly setting up his next shot. Good to see him working it both ways with ease.3:01: Tiger pushed his tee shot into the right rough, then hit a fantastic recovery shot from a thick lie onto the green. He had a long look at birdie that rolled about four feet past, leaving him with a tricky left-to-right par putt, which he missed. That's three three putts on the day for Woods, and he's still one under.2:39: Not the best chip from Woods, as he left himself about six feet for birdie, but he makes it anyway. Four straight for Tiger to get to two under for the day.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10964952191957975042:30: Woods rips a 3-wood from 269 to just in front of the green. Hate to jinx him, but there's no reason he shouldn't easily make his fourth straight birdie here (ducks).2:20: Three in a row for Woods as he rolls in another at No. 10 and moves to one under. If he finds the fairway again at the 11th, four in a row will be in his sights. Meanwhile, Rory makes his par to stay at one under and JT ends up holing his 10 footer for birdie to get to four under. Finally a little bit of JUICE from this threesome.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096489287753711616https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096489787672780800By the way, it looks like we know when they'll be heading back out for round two later today. Here's an update from the Tiger Tracker:https://twitter.com/GCTigerTracker/status/1096481806067523585That should give them enough time to get at least 11 or 12 holes in.At the 11th, Woods stripes another drive down the fairway. He's really starting to cook.2:12: Tiger's shot was a tad more difficult than we thought, as he had to avoid a bunker and take it up high to get it back to the pin. He was successful, sticking it to about three feet. Hell of a shot. Even better was Rory's shot, as he flopped it from a nice lie and got it to hang on just off the back of the green and stay out of the back bunker. Thomas, who had the easiest shot, put too much spin on his chip, leaving himself with about 10 feet for birdie.2:07: Finally, Tiger, Rory and JT hit their tee shots, and it looks like the ensuing entertainment will be well worth the wait. Tiger is in the collection area left of the green, where he has a straightforward chip that should set him up with a good chance to make birdie. Thomas is just in front of the green, and he'll have a great chance to make a birdie as well. Rory ... um ... not so much. He's in the rough with a greenside bunker in front of him and a pin he won't be able to get close to, and just holding the green would be a miracle.1:52: Woods drains his four-footer for bird and turns in even par 35. Real strong finish to his opening nine, and now it looks like he'll have a long wait at the 10th. DeChambeau, Kuchar and Rahm have still yet to hit their tee shots.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10964831254067896321:47: Tiger had just 122 left to the green and stuck one in there close. He has four feet left for birdie to turn in even par, which would be a small victory after that ugly three putt back at No. 7. Not to mention he'll have a prime opportunity to get into red figures at the driveable par-4 10th.1:41: Woods cranks another high fade right down the middle with the driver at No. 9. With the tees up today, he'll have a low iron in his hand for his approach.1:34: And he's on the board! Woods bounces back with a birdie putt from 15 feet, getting him back to one over. We'll see if that gets him going before making the turn.1:30: From 125 yards out, Woods hit a wedge and hated it from the second he made contact. While he did pull it, he's still hole high and inside 20 feet. Hideki Matsuyama-esque move from Tiger.1:24: Woods rips one right down the middle at the par-4 eighth. Should have a short iron in.1:15: Tiger's birdie putt was actually from just off the green on the fringe, and he rolled it by some four feet. Then, he missed the comebacker for par, dropping to two over on the day. Oof.1:09: Fairway and a green for Woods at the seventh. Good look at birdie coming up to get back to level par.12:58: Another hole, another par for Woods, who two-putted from 24 feet on the par-3 sixth. In the group up ahead, though, Jon Rahm is making a move at three under through six.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/109646557828021452912:47: Another meh hole for Tiger on No. 5, just missing the fairway with his tee shot, finding the front of the green with a so-so approach, and two-putting for another par from 43 feet. Woods remains at one over through five holes while his playing partners, McIlroy and Thomas, both remain at one under.12:42: As Matt Kuchar's ball is in the air on the par-3 sixth, a fan yells, \"Go low—just not with the gratuity!\" Despite Matt maintaining this is \"not a story,\" it is. And this won't be the last comment like this.12:29: Woods hit a nice shot to about 15 feet on the par-3 fourth, but ran his birdie effort by the hole. Still one over. Still no highlights. At least, from Tiger. Here was Spieth's closing birdie from about an hour ago, because there is not much else exciting going on right now.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/109644546143346688112:17: Another missed fairway and another short approach from Tiger on the par-4 third. Although, Woods found the putting surface, he was unable to two-putt from 63 feet, missing a seven-footer for par after badly misreading his first putt. That drops Tiger to one over through three holes. Not a lot of highlights so far. . .12:02: Tiger misses right off the tee on No. 2 then comes up short on another approach. But his pitch shot nearly goes down, leaving him with a tap-in par. Even par through two holes.11:49: After that perfect opening tee shot, Tiger hit a hideous approach with a 5-iron that came up way short in a fairway bunker. From there, he hit his third to 10 feet but missed the putt to walk away with a disappointing par. Both of Tiger's playing partners, McIlroy and Thomas, make birdie.11:38: Matt Kuchar just misses his eagle attempt from 25 feet on No. 1, but taps in for birdie. Kuchar has been in the news a lot this week over a caddie controversy dating back to his win at the Mayakoba Golf Classic. A controversy he didn't help with his comments on Wednesday. Is it possible some of those \"Kuuuuch\" shouts will turn to \"Mooooch\"? Kinda sounded like it on the first hole. . .11:34: Jordan Spieth is in with a seven-under-par 64 to take the early lead. Spieth needed only 21 putts during his bogey-free round. Of course, starting tournaments hasn't been a problem for Spieth of late. Finishing, however, has been a different story. Incredibly, Spieth is looking for his first win since the 2017 British Open and his first top 5 since last year's Masters.11:32: Woods smashes a driver off the first tee that finds the fairway. The opening par 5 at Riviera is essentially a long par 4 and one of the easiest holes on the PGA Tour all year so Tiger is thinking at least birdie after that tee shot.10:53: So far, so good on the Friday weather:https://twitter.com/GCTigerTracker/status/1096437235262533632And with lift, clean and place in play (for at least the first round), low scores are out there. Let's set the over/under on the Par-71 layout at 68.5.10:45: We are approximately 45 minutes away from Tiger's tee time and it's another major champ who is already off to a fantastic start. Jordan Spieth has the lead at six under through 15 holes. Spieth leads Patrick Rodgers by one and then there's a big group at four under, including Bill Haas, who is playing in the event a year after being involved in a car accident during last year's tournament that killed a friend he was staying with. Make sure you read Brian Wacker's piece from earlier in the week on how Haas is still trying to move on from that tragedy.10:35: As we move within an hour from Tiger teeing off, check out GOLFTV's latest behind-the-scenes video with Woods in which he says his bag has up to 16(!) golf gloves during rainy rounds and he explains why he doesn't like wearing rain jackets:https://twitter.com/GOLFTV/status/1096246456795697153\"Pops used to say, 'Once you're wet, you're wet.

Once he started running the front office, his blinking at Paul George on national TV contributed to the Lakers getting fined again for tampering. Johnson’s praise of Giannis Antetokounmpo drew yet another tampering fine.So, though he escaped punishment for his recent comments on 76ers guard Ben Simmons, Johnson refused to answer a question about Hornets guard Kemba Walker.Carolina Blitz:Asked Magic about Kemba and he said y’all aren’t going to catch him slipping anymore. pic.twitter.com/sQZtIWnQbn— Carolina Blitz (@KeepBlitzin) February 15, 2019Johnson:You know I can’t answer any questions about no players, because every time I do it, I get fined. But anybody else do it, they don’t get fined. So I’m going to stay away from that one.I don’t blame Johnson for feeling that way.Other teams’ owners, coaches and executives have repeatedly publicly discussed rival players without facing announced punishment.To be fair, the NBA doesn’t reveal every fine. Bucks owner Marc Lasry reportedly just got fined for tampering, but the league never announced it. But, at minimum, there’s an inconsistency with how the NBA exposes Johnson’s transgressions.Even NBA commissioner Adam Silver said last year there’s a spotlight on the Lakers due to prior tampering. That strikes me as unfair. The Lakers already paid for their prior violations and should now be held to the same standard as everyone else.And for what it’s worth, I wish that standard allowed an all-time great point guard like Johnson to publicly share his thoughts on Kemba Walker.Gareth Bale has landed himself in hot water after La Liga denounced the Real Madrid star for his celebration in the Madrid derby, which could carry a ban of four to 12 games.The Welsh forward scored as a substitute in the 3-1 victory over Atletico Madrid, bringing up his 100th goal for the club.And during the celebrations that followed, Bale \"lifted his right arm near his head in a clear sign of provocation towards the fans, then giving a gesture which could be seen as obscene and disdainful by folding his arm and striking it with his other hand.\"In a statement released by La Liga, Bale’s punishment will be decided by whether he incited the crowd or not.If Bale is guilty of “inciting opposition fans” to cause a hostile reaction, the punishment could carry four to 12 games, if there was no hostile reaction but intent, then it could be as little as one to three games.The gesture is referred to in Spain as ‘corte de mangas,’ with the moment not picked up in the referee’s match report.A committee will now decide whether the gesture merits a punishment.Bale also featured in Real’s Champions League victory over Ajax.Los Blancos take a 2-1 lead back to the Bernabeu for the second leg of the last 16 tie after Marco Asensio’s late winner.Earlier this week Heisman Trophy winner — and first round draft pick of the Oakland Athletics — Kyler Murray chose football over baseball, committing himself to the NFL draft.

In the last month alone he's won his 44th PGA Tour event, finished second in another, hit every fairway in a round for the first time in 21 years, shot a 60, pulled off this impossible recovery shot, gone viral just by rolling his eyes and said he might drop the Players from his schedule because he's already won it (a literal mic drop). The man simply cannot be stopped right now.Leave it to the weather to literally rain on Lefty's parade. On Thursday at the Genesis Open, Mickelson began his first round at the difficult short par-4 10th and drove into one of the bunkers up near the green, leaving him with a dreaded lengthy sand shot. He wound up hitting it over the green, and his ball plugged in the back bunker, setting up an even harder shot than he just had. As you'll hear PGA Tour Live commentator Shane Bacon say, avoiding making a six was probably the goal, but after Mickelson hit his third into another bunker on the other side of the green, a six suddenly became best-case scenario. How does a four sound instead?https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096076528142626818Find us a more Phil Mickelson par ever... you can't. He's always got a flair for the dramatic. The problem?

(Old man golfers)The dust is barely settled in the wake of the end of the Markelle Fultz era in Philadelphia, and the former 76ers guard is already taking shots at his old team.His old coach Brett Brown in particular.Fultz had his introductory press conference with the Orlando Magic on Thursday after being traded at last week’s deadline and praised his new coach Steve Clifford while taking a veiled shot at Brown.“It just excites me to know that I have a coach that’s going to push you to be better and not just going to tell you what you want to hear,” Fultz said.That’s direct praise for his new coach. But the message for Brown is clear. Fultz didn’t like what he heard from the Philadelphia coaching staff.Fultz never had any public dispute with the 76ers, but it was evident that he and the team had different approaches to the struggles that saw him shoot 41.4 percent from the field, 26.7 percent from 3-point distance and 53.4 percent from the line in limited action after being selected as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2017 draft.It’s still not clear whether injury or a mental block – or both – are the cause of his shooting issues.After his agent announced that the nerve disorder thoracic outlet syndrome was the root of the shooting woes, Fultz never played again for the 76ers.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]Fultz appears to be fully embracing the fresh start in Orlando as a player and a person.“I think the biggest thing we talked about what doing thing the right way,” Fultz said. “Just building me up both as a man and on the court. I think that’s music to my ears, really just. Two things I really want to do is be the best player I can be and be the best young man I can be.”Fultz described the experience of his nerve disorder to reporters.“It’s hard to lift up your arms, you lose feeling in your fingers,” Fultz said. “You can’t tell when it’s going to happen. It’s not like you do the same motion every time. You get tingling in your fingers, numbness. Stuff like that.”He also curtly dismissed any notion that his shooting struggles are due to anything but injury.“I had an injury,” Fultz said. “I was out there trying to play through that. I never lost confidence.”Asked about a timetable to return, Fultz dodged the question to talk about rehab.“Right now it’s just about getting everything the right way,” he said. “Rehab’s been going great. I’m just taking my time and doing everything the right way.”More from Yahoo Sports: • PGA Tour pro defends paying caddie $5K on $1.3M win • NFL bars NCAA’s all-time sack leader from combine • Only one NBA team failed to scout Antetokounmpo • Black History honor for Kaepernick sacked by lawmakers He might not be well known to NFL fans at large, but New England Patriots fans know linebacker Kyle Van Noy — acquired basically for free from the Detroit Lions at the 2016 trade deadline — has been a big part of the defense the last two years, and has a knack for making plays at the right time.Van Noy is getting a little shine after winning his second Super Bowl ring with New England, appearing on the “Pardon My Take” podcast on Thursday to dish on all things Patriots and Super Bowl LIII.One thing that Van Noy revealed: the Los Angeles Rams didn’t do anything surprising during the game on offense.“I couldn’t believe that,” Van Noy said. “They really didn’t do — not one wrinkle. I was like, ‘What the hell?’ They’ve got so many good players, they’ve got so many things they’ve done all year, and the one play they gave us which was a wrinkle was the [Brandin] Cooks screen that hit for a little bit.“And that was it… Or maybe too, we were playing so good they were like, ‘[Expletive], we don’t know what to do.’ ”Hindsight, of course, is 20-20, but given that the Patriots’ coaching staff is known for having its players prepared for any and everything, it seems unwise that Los Angeles didn’t add some new plays or looks to try to stump New England.Van Noy said the Patriots’ culture, specifically coach Bill Belichick’s practice of not sparing anyone in the film room, even Tom Brady, is part of why the team continues to win.“Oh yeah. Yeah, that [stuff is] sick, to be honest, because it sets the table,” Van Noy said. “Like, OK, it doesn’t matter who you are, everyone’s on an even playing field. This is how it is here at work. You come in and you earn everything.“And I respect that because I felt like that gave me a chance to get on the field when I came in mid-year, and [Belichick] was like, ‘It doesn’t matter who you are or what you’ve done. You earn your keep.’ ”More from Yahoo Sports: • Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight The Brady Conundrum: How do you go about replacing the GOAT? originally appeared on nbcsportsboston.comThe Patriots hatched a Tom Brady succession plan after the 2013 season when they drafted Jimmy Garoppolo.Brady blew that up.Now, five years, four Super Bowl appearances, three Super Bowl wins, two Super Bowl MVPs and a regular-season MVP later, it's time to gingerly -- caaaauuuuuutiooooousssssllllyyyyy -- begin the process again.This time should be different.Even though Brady's contract hasn't been extended past the 2019 season, the love and happiness we saw on the field after the Rams were dispatched in SB53 is a good sign.MORE PATRIOTSAreas of Change: Will Pats be able to retain free agents Trey Flowers and Trent Brown?Brady's wariness about the Patriots' plans for him, and Bill Belichick's wariness about wedding his team to a quarterback who's closer to 50 years old than he is to 30, has dissipated.Once a new deal is in place -- Jonathan Kraft indicated that might be before training camp, though as of the Super Bowl conversations hadn't started -- Brady will have a written assurance that he will leave the Patriots and the NFL on his terms.That wasn't the case in early 2014 when the soon-to-be-37-year-old Brady saw the Patriots spend a first-round pick on a defensive tackle (Dominique Easley) and their second-rounder on Garoppolo. That, after a '13 season Brady spent throwing to the likes of Aaron Dobson, Josh Boyce, Kenbrell Thompkins and Austin Collie.Garoppolo was a stick of dynamite under Brady's behind. He was the existential threat Brady feared made flesh.Jimmy might have thought he was drafted to learn how to play quarterback in the NFL and have a nice career. To Brady, Garoppolo was there to take his job, throw his career into upheaval, uproot his family and see Brady cast out into the NFL wilderness.MORE PATRIOTSPerry: If Beckham is on the trade block, should Patriots be willing to pay the price?And, in contrast to the guy Brady succeeded in 2001 (and, by extension, did all those things to), Brady wasn't going to snort derisively at the plucky little draft pick here to take his job. He would crush the threat.He did.Brady played so well that -- despite Garoppolo developing into a bona-fide front-line quarterback under Belichick and Josh McDaniels (and Brady) -- Brady left the ever-prepared Patriots with no recourse when Garoppolo's contract was about to expire.Brady was too good to bench and too important to trade. Garoppolo was too expensive to franchise and too smart to take a \"bridge\" contract so he could watch Brady from the sidelines while his own hair started to gray at the temples. So off he went around Halloween, 2017.A lot's happened in the 16 months since.MORE PATRIOTSPhil Perry's Mock Draft 1.0: Pats start looking for Gronk's replacementBut now here we are, in the offseason of Brady's 42nd year. And the complex question of how to find the player who will eventually replace the greatest quarterback in NFL history still lingers.Do you draft his successor? If you do, do you do it this year? Do you do it next year?Do you try to get into the top 10 to get your pick of the litter? Do you stay put, confident that the muttonheads across the league will miss out as they did with Brady and Garoppolo (or Aaron Rodgers, Russell Wilson, Drew Brees, Brett Favre, Johnny Unitas . . . you get the point)? How much will it cost to get into the top 10? Do you package picks from this season -- when you will have six in the first three rounds -- and pick a sucker who will suck next year and fleece them for their 2020 first-rounder? How high do you have to go for a blue-chip, given the number of first-round quarterbacks that will be taken this year and that were taken in 2018?Is it a trade for somebody another team's given up on or has no work for, like San Francisco's Nick Mullens? A veteran who will hit free agency like Nick Foles, Case Keenum or Teddy Bridgewater?How does the successor play the position? Similar to Brady in that brain/eyes/accuracy/commitment trumps legs/arm strength/versatility?MORE PATRIOTSShould Pats be interested in Demaryius Thomas? No . . . and yesOr is there an embrace of the fact that trying to find a quarterback similar to a guy who came into the league after four years at Michigan at the end of last century with a once-in-a-lifetime work ethic is a pipe dream?Aside from who the successor is and how he plays, can Brady -- the lion in winter -- be tapped to help groom whoever is being brought aboard to take over?Brady -- contrary to sexed-up speculation -- didn't actively undermine Garoppolo at any point. They were teammates. He helped Garoppolo play the position better. They became close. But he wasn't quite showing him his world, either. Brady is famous for saying he's not giving away his secrets to younger quarterbacks until after he's done.With the end-date likely to be agreed upon when he signs an extension, does he become more a mentor so that the success of the franchise has a better chance to continue after he leaves? Would the Patriots want him to do that?Or would they want a blank(ish) slate to work with that isn't saying, \"But Tom said . . . \" when they try to shape him to succeed?And that contract? What's it look like? Does Brady demand pay commensurate with what he's accomplished? Is he in the mood to do the team another financial solid given the only bump they have him in 2018 was incentives he never reached? How does that impact the structure of the team?These questions aren't new. What is new is the level of angst and anxiousness. It's dissipated tremendously.That won't make finding his replacement or choosing the means by which the Patriots will do it any easier. But it's less fraught now.The irony is, the Patriots already successfully found Brady's successor.

Even his father Mychal, who played five seasons for the Lakers, believes his son will re-sign with the Warriors. [RELATED: For Steve Kerr, Steph Curry and Klay Thompson are mix of NBA past and present]The Warriors selected Thompson with the No. 11 overall pick in the 2011 NBA Draft. Since then, he's been a five-time NBA All-Star, three-time Finals champion and two-time All-NBA selection. Anything could happen, but it's safe to say the Klay and the Dubs have quite the relationship and are ready to tie the knot.Jason Witten never worked with Kellen Moore as a coach, but he did practice with Moore when both of them were still active players with the Cowboys.That experience is enough for Witten to think Moore has “a way about him” that will pay off in his new job as the Cowboys offensive coordinator. Witten said this week that he believes Moore will be innovative and that the offense will take a “big step” by gearing things around quarterback Dak Prescott.“Yeah, I think he will do the things that Dak likes to do,” Witten said, via the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. “He will do the things they have to do to win. That is the way they have to play. I think they will use the pass to set up the run. Not just the run to set up the pass. I think he will add some nice wrinkles to that offense.”With head coach Jason Garrett coaching in the final year of his contract, Moore’s work with the offense will have a lot to do with how Dallas does in 2019 and with the path the team charts in the years that follow. If Witten’s correct, that path will probably look a lot like the one they’ve been on for a while.The story of Danny Ainge's Greece visit to watch Giannis Antetokounmpo is a wild one originally appeared on nbcsportsboston.comThe Boston Celtics took an early interest in Greece basketball star Giannis Antetokounmpo before he was selected in the 2013 NBA Draft.C's president of basketball operations Danny Ainge actually went over to Europe to watch Antetokounmpo play, and the postgame scene was nothing short of crazy.Fans were going wild, and some of them even yelled at Ainge because they thought he was associated with Antetokounmpo's team -- Ainge was sitting near its bench during the game.Check out the video below to hear the wild story of Ainge's scouting visit to Greece:Time for another \"Finding Giannis\" outtake. The first NBA team to scout Giannis was the Boston Celtics. As is often the case in Greece, hilarity ensued, as told by @GrgpanouOCT about Danny Ainge's visit. #FindingGiannis will be broadcasted Saturday on TNT at 630pm EST. pic.twitter.com/8bLjIjHv77— Jonathan Givony (@DraftExpress) February 14, 2019The Celtics liked what they saw from Antetokounmpo, but they decided to take Gonzaga forward/center Kelly Olynyk with their 2013 first-round pick instead. The C's made a trade with the Dallas Mavericks (who owned the No. 13 pick) to select Olynyk, whose ability to handle the ball and shoot well from the outside as a big man was appealing.Antetokounmpo ultimately was taken by the Milwaukee Bucks with the 15th pick. The \"Greek Freak\" has since become one of the league's best players and arguably is the leading candidate for MVP this season. It's still hard to fault Ainge and other executives for passing on Antetokounmpo, though. He was a very raw talent, and other players in that draft class were expected to provide more immediate contributions.Click here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!

They run the same plays over and over again. All they do is flop and shoot free throws. Maybe they’re even ruining basketball. Who isn’t these days, right?Houston’s offense operates with rigid discipline. The Rockets run and run James Harden off screens until he finds a tenable matchup to exploit. Tenable, so we’re clear, is a loosely defined term for a player who only needs a sliver of space to shoot from anywhere on the floor, whose combined ball-handling and strength psychs out defenders and referees alike.It is repetitive, sure, but in a way that’s endlessly fascinating. The Rockets repeatedly put the ball in the hands of the one of the NBA’s most creative, destructive scorers and wait for him to find a sieve — or create one. Harden now holds the second-longest 30-point scoring streak in NBA history, breaking 31 games in Wednesday night’s loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves, and he’s averaging a league-scorching 36.5 points per game.I’d argue all that makes the Rockets more watchable than most teams, which dilly-dally for possessions at a time, only looking to optimize in the face of urgency. You won’t find any freewheeling action from Iguodala-types in Houston. Even Austin Rivers has (mostly) held himself in check. Every time I turn on a Rockets game, Harden or Chris Paul has possession of the ball and is on the cusp of doing something. The game becomes a successive highlight reel that doesn’t allow you to turn the dial.The same quality that makes the Rockets so entertaining right now — and will likely garner Harden a second MVP — might be what hurts them in the playoffs again. The fuse is burning bright: Harden holds the ball an average of 9.6 seconds when he touches it, the highest mark in the NBA. His usage rate is 39 percent, smashing second place by 7 percent. What Harden’s doing might not be the best idea for the Rockets’ future outlook.But it’s definitely not boring. Even on defense, an opponent can make a name for himself with a signature moment against Harden — just ask Josh Okogie.As for as Harden’s high free-throw attempts bogging the game down, I won’t be convinced that a generation that cuts away to their iPhone screen 50 times per day is that bothered by an opportunity to look away from the action. When Harden’s playing, it’s the only chance you’re going to get.Because it seems like it, at least in the East. For the past few weeks, the dominant Warriors storyline has been about how Kevin Durant’s impending free agency could impact their title run. After a win against the Utah Jazz two nights ago, Durant said he feels the team is not playing well. These are the same Warriors, mind you, who are 16-3 since the New Year. Not only have they won all 11 games DeMarcus Cousins has played in — they’ve blown the tops off buildings, outscoring opponents by 9.7 points per 100 possessions. Until July 1, Warriors inevitability reigns.Why is it, then, that the Eastern Conference is littered with high-end teams that made big bets on winning this year? The Boston Celtics made their bed a while ago, with Kyrie Irving’s contract expiring when the season ends. The Toronto Raptors traded franchise cornerstone DeMar DeRozan for a chance to woo Kawhi Leonard for a season. Then they doubled down by trading for Marc Gasol. In sum, the 76ers exchanged Jerryd Bayless, Robert Covington, Dario Saric, Wilson Chandler, Mike Muscala, Landry Shamet, two first-round picks and two second-round picks for Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris, a pair of stars with deals that expire at the end of the year.(Side note: At least one of these three teams has to flame out in the second round. And then what does it do? For once, the playoff drama will be in the East, if not the title.)Could it be possible that the Warriors are so dominant that they’ve convinced the rest of the NBA to change the goalposts of ultimate success? Because as it stands right now, we’ve got a set of teams that went all in on trying to get to second place. It feels more like they’re auditioning for a post-Warriors future than trying to succeed in the current landscape. Even in a world where success is narrowly defined by wins and losses, perception is everything. And some things are inherent: If the rest of the NBA can’t compete against the Warriors, they still can’t help but compete against themselves.The aftermath of the most emboldened trade request in recent NBA history has been ugly. Anthony Davis is not a Laker — or a Knick or a Celtic or a Buck for that matter. And the New Orleans Pelicans don’t seem to have much use for him either. They’d rather sit him and pile up losses, focus on the lottery race and protect Davis’ health so they can trade him in the offseason. But the NBA issued a directive: The Pelicans would be fined $100,000 for every game he sat.So it is that after playing well enough to keep the Pelicans in it, Davis was benched in the fourth quarter two games in a row. Then, against the Orlando Magic, they got blown out by 30 points, which led to Davis — chef’s kiss — criticizing the team’s effort. So things aren’t good. What’s worse: It doesn’t seem like they’re going to get any better.Thanks to the NBA’s orders, this is the only reasonable compromise for both the Pelicans and Davis. He gets to pervert his livelihood — surely important to a man who has spent so many days involuntarily sidelined by injuries — while the Pelicans at least get to lose some of the time.Here’s what it comes down to: The NBA can’t make a decision that weighs the Pelicans real interests, because it can’t be so blithely rational about what’s best for them, which is tanking. In an alternate universe with no draft lottery, the Pelicans might at least be incentivized to let Davis play when it matters to get fans in seats. But the league won’t acknowledge its worst kept secret, so a dysfunctional situation is primed to only get worse.Nothing like the 76ers to get the Boston Celtics going. And nothing like a loss to the Celtics on Tuesday night to spread anxiety in the lives of 76ers fans.Despite the addition of Tobias Harris, the 76ers lost to the Kyrie-less Celtics in the same ways they’ve habitually lost to them: The Celtics stuck like glue to the few shooters the 76ers play at the same time and treated Ben Simmons like a non-entity, while Al Horford ate Joel Embiid’s lunch. The Sixers couldn’t protect the perimeter on the other end, so they never got much of a chance to get out in transition.I won’t write them off as quickly as I did after Christmas, if only because Harris is the type of sharpshooter who could tip the scales in favor of an old-school style — if they’re willing to embrace it.Since trading for Jimmy Butler in November, the Sixers are seventh in pace, 11th in defense and 16th in offensive rebounding. This is a team with three starters who are above 6-foot-8, including the league’s most imposing center since Shaq, but it’s stuck in the middle because it’s trying to fit old-school parts into a new-school game. The league has been crashing full-tilt into more space and pace for years, so you can forgive the Sixers for trying, but you don’t win championships by playing against your strengths.Philadelphia should be slow, plodding, muscly and mean. It should crash the glass with impunity, hunt cross-matches with pick-and-rolls and bully defenders in the post. The mere idea of entering the paint against the 76ers should make opponents cower with fear.The only rub is that slowing it down doesn’t serve Ben Simmons’ style, but they’re going to have to figure out the inevitable tension between his transition-happy game and Embiid’s half-court dominance eventually. Better to do it while playing to your strengths and find out if it works now, instead of two years down the road.Following Jeremy Lin’s first game as a Raptor, he took to the podium and shared some interesting thoughts on the presence of the international media. Here are some snippets, from the Toronto Star:“Yeah, [Mandarin media] probably happens in every city that has a strong Asian contingent,” Lin said. “Happened in Atlanta as well, but not this. So again, I’m very proud to represent Asian people on a global platform, on a global scale. And for me to be here where there’s a lot of Asians, like, I used to run from it, you know?“Because that’s all anybody’s ever wanted to look for. Like, ‘Oh, he’s Asian, he’s Asian, he’s Asian.’ And I was like, talk about my basketball. But now people can see I can play, I belong in the NBA, and I’ve really embraced just being able to represent Asians and do it the right way, hopefully.“Yeah, I mean, I think I was really jaded after the New York stretch,” Lin continued. “I think there was a lot of things that happened that made me give up a little bit on people, per se. And that was a huge part of the story, and that was a huge point of contention for a lot of people as to why I was getting the publicity, or why things were the way they were.“So I kind of wanted to run from that a little bit. I would probably say three years down the road, I kind of turned a corner, and I would say being hurt for two straight years, and seeing that my Asian fan base, I don’t feel like it dropped off one bit. And I haven’t even touched the court. Like, every year I go over to Asia and I can’t even walk through the airport — it’s insane. So to see them do that after all the highs and lows, but really going through the lows post-Linsanity, which culminated in those injuries, for me, I’m still blown away. And again, that’s fed into why I want to carry myself a certain way.”I don’t have a lot to say here, except that it’s touching to see a man whose identity was leveraged and controlled by outside forces for so long get to stop running away from how he’s perceived and finally be himself: an NBA player who once turned the basketball universe on its head, an Asian-American, a God-fearing Harvard grad. He has lived long enough in the public eye that the public has finally accepted what they originally thought were contradictory traits. That, friends, is how stereotypes are broken.More from Yahoo Sports:• PGA Tour pro defends paying caddie $5K on $1.3M win • NFL bars NCAA’s all-time sack leader from combine • Only one NBA team failed to scout Antetokounmpo • Black History honor for Kaepernick sacked by lawmakers Isaiah Thomas gets standing ovation, drills 3-pointer in Nuggets debut originally appeared on nbcsportsboston.comBrad Stevens could have begun his All-Star vacation Wednesday night after the Boston Celtics defeated the Detroit Pistons.But Stevens had a Denver Nuggets game to catch.The Celtics head coach set his DVR for Nuggets-Sacramento Kings to watch his former star player, Isaiah Thomas, make his Denver debut after a lengthy absence caused by offseason hip surgery.Thomas didn't disappoint.

At least, maybe you do when you’re Keith Tkachuk, and you’ve raised two true hockey ragamuffins in Brady Tkachuk and Matthew Tkachuk. Chances are, Keith’s probably more preoccupied with getting his sons not to obnoxiously dangle their mouthpieces out of their mouths.(And, yeah, maybe to make sure Matthew doesn’t get hosed on his second contract.)Anyway, Keith was on hand to see – and chuckle at – Brady, the younger of the two NHL Tkachuk kids, getting into a fight with Jonathan Ericsson of the Detroit Red Wings. It’s probably fair to say that Ericsson got the better of Brady, but judge for yourself in the video above this post’s headline, via Sportsnet.Judging by Hockey Fights’ listings, the family fight counts are now unofficially:Brady: Three. He’s a rookie, so he’s clearly endearing himself to opponents already.Matthew: Seven through three seasons.Keith: 51 fights during 1,201 regular-season and 89 playoff contests.Considering the temperaments of the Tkachuk brothers and father, chances are we’ll see more scuffles for both Brady and Matthew before they hopefully enjoy retirement as much as Keith seems to be enjoying it.

The deal, first reported by Joel Sherman of the New York Post, would buy up Severino’s arbitration years and comes with a $15 million club option for his first year of free agency.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]By agreeing to this deal, the Yankees and Severino avoid arbitration for 2019. He’ll make $4 million this season, $10 million next, then $10.25 million in 2021 and $11 million in 2022. The club option is for 2023. In the grand scheme of society, this is a very generous contract. In baseball’s economic bubble, it’s another young player signing for below-market value relative to his skills and potential.It’s hard to blame Severino for taking the deal, looking around at a free-agent world where Harper and Machado are still available, as are Dallas Keuchel and Craig Kimbrel. Especially since we haven’t heard even slight grumblings about teams being interested in Keuchel and Kimbrel.Coming off a breakout season in which he went 19-8 with a 3.39 ERA, the 25-year-old Severino was given a deal that’s pretty hard to turn down: “Do you want $40 million guaranteed, yes or no?”The other players faced with a similar question this week were Philadelphia Phillies ace Aaron Nola, who said yes to a four-year, $45 million deal Wednesday. It also avoided arbitration and bought out two of Nola’s free agency years, making it the most below-market deal of any of these.The Minnesota Twins locked up two of their talented young players Thursday, as right fielder Max Kepler agreed to a five-year, $35 million deal with a $10 million club option for 2024. It buys out three years of free agency for Kepler, 26. Shortstop Jorge Polanco also agreed to a five-year extension, his is worth $25.75 million with two option years that could keep him in Minnesota through 2025.In a vacuum, these types of extensions look like win-wins: The players get guaranteed money as they’re coming off good seasons. The clubs get cost-certainty to help them navigate the future — whether it’s the Yankees and Phillies trying to add big free agents this year or next, or a team like the Twins striving for contention with a homegrown core.In a bigger sense, though, it’s hard not to look at these deals in the current state of free agency and wonder if they’re a symptom of something else. Is it the market correcting itself? Is it baseball’s economy morphing into something new? Or maybe it’s just players looking around and saying, “Well, I better get my money now.”According to numerous reports, there’s a fear that for this generation of young players the light at the end of the tunnel — the big free-agency payday — won’t be there for them in the same way it was for so many other players.So while it’s great that stars like Justin Verlander, Clayton Kershaw and Max Scherzer are publicly speaking out about the current state of free agency, they’re on the right side of it. They got their mega deals.The younger players find themselves in a different sort of peril. It’s entirely possible that these are the biggest paydays these players ever get, which is a much different economic model that we’ve seen from baseball in the past.Whether it’s right or wrong — and that’s certainly something that’s up for debate heading into the next collective-bargaining agreement — baseball’s economy has often been backward. Players get paid less, relative to the market, in their pre-free agency years. The best recent example is Mike Trout winning the MVP in 2014 at age 22 while making $1 million.He got a raise to $6 million the next season, but in 2015 was still making a fraction of what people like Ryan Howard ($25M), Albert Pujols ($24M), Joe Mauer ($23M), Mark Teixeira ($22.5M) and Jose Reyes ($22M) were making.But that overpay is a necessary part baseball’s economic ecosystem too. It’s a fact: Players get overpaid as their careers decline. It’s almost like baseball’s way of making up for underpaying players during their early years. It’s baseball’s golden parachute. What’s happening these days is fewer teams are accepting that overpay as part of the how the system works.In the past few years, arbitration salaries have gotten higher and higher, and teams have tried harder to lock up younger stars before free agency. It’s why we’ve see players like Madison Bumgarner, Chris Archer, Chris Sale and Paul Goldschmidt become valuable trade chips for their team-friendly contract extensions.Teams are getting smarter about where their money goes, and how to keep value in their assets. These extensions to Severino, Nola and the rest show that they’re willing to spend money, just in the way that they want.Earlier this week, former Miami Marlins president David Samson tweeted something in response to Justin Verlander, saying the “broken system” talk was wrong. Players and their agents, Samson said, needed to adjust to a “new reality.”He may be right about the new reality part. The monster paydays at the end of the free agency tunnel could be fading away. If Bryce Harper and Manny Machado can’t get them, who can?The new reality could be players seizing their money. Whenever they can.– – – – – –Mike Oz is a writer at Yahoo Sports.

However, Wainwright framed the situation with a little more urgency on Friday by expressing concerns that a day of reckoning could happen sooner than later.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]Speaking to InsideSTL.com’s Tim McKernan, Wainwright said it was inevitable that the players will go on strike unless major changes are made to help bridge the widening gap. But he’s also worried that frustrations could reach a boiling point during the season leading to some form of a revolt. Perhaps even a mid-season walkout.#STLCards pitcher Adam Wainwright on @TMASTL: “Unless something changes, there’s going to be a strike. 100%. I’m just worried people are going to walk-out mid-season.” pic.twitter.com/M8WeRVcASe— Tim McKernan (@tmckernan) February 15, 2019“Unless something changes, there’s going to be a strike. 100%,” Wainwright said regarding the free-agent freeze that has left stars like Bryce Harper and Manny Machado without contracts. “I’m just worried people are going to walkout midseason.”It’s conceivable given the current climate, but a players revolt on that level still feels like a long shot. The target date we should all still be looking at is Dec. 1, 2021. That’s when the current collective bargaining agreement ends and the owners will be forced to come to the table.That doesn’t mean we should just dismiss Wainwright’s concerns about a 2019 strike. While they might feel a little on the dramatic side, the frustration that has built all offseason as dozens of free agents, including and especially Harper and Machado, remain unsigned is becoming more palpable by the day. There’s a genuine feeling that owners are determined to cut back on salaries even as profits continue to reach new heights, it’s possible the players’ patience will run out if the free-agent freeze continues to drag on. Wainwright thinks so, and he’s far from alone.In Friday’s interview, the 37-year-old right-hander also criticized owners and front offense personnel for placing too much emphasis on “analytics” and placing everything in a “sabermetric box” that discounts intangibles and other immeasurable aspects of baseball.Adam Wainwright said today on ⁦@TMASTL⁩ that he expects there to be a strike “100%.”The context of the conversation comes from a discussion on how Bryce Harper and Manny Machado are still without teams.You can see Wainwright’s reasoning in the video below. pic.twitter.com/GXsmx4cXk1— Tim McKernan (@tmckernan) February 15, 2019Wainwright admitted that there’s always risk in making long-term financial commitments to players, but emphasized that doing so marks a commitment to winning that several teams seemingly lack.“Part of it is smart from their side of it, but you have to realize it’s about winning. So, if Bryce Harper wants 10 years and he’s 26 years old. He’s going to be a dynamic player. The same can be said about Manny Machado. These guys are superstar players.”The deeper we get into it the more obvious it is that the players know what battles lie ahead. The only real question is how much worse it will get before any progress is made toward a satisfactory resolution.More from Yahoo Sports:• Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight MLB rumors: Bryce Harper has made his decision, says D.C. radio host originally appeared on nbcsportsbayarea.comA report has come out from the East Coast saying Bryce Harper has come to a decision on which team he will play for in 2019 and beyond.Chris Russell, a sports radio talk show host from 106.7 The Fan in Washington D.C., (who has been on the Harper beat for some time) said the free agent slugger could make a decision in the next 24 hours.\"Maybe I took a little bit of a leap of faith here based on some indications I got from a real good source,\" Russell told 94WIP, in Philadelphia, on Friday.\"Bryce and his representatives, (Scott) Boras, his people, his wife Kayla, they've been meeting since Monday morning in Vegas. Bryce originally wanted this done, when it took this long, by Valentine's Day. Obviously, the contract has not been announced, signed, or whatever.\"\"But I'm led to believe by the people that I've talked to that are close to the situation -- and I have, again, a real good source that has helped me through this process, let's just leave it at that,\" Russell said. \"That Bryce was in a mood to celebrate yesterday. Now, the source said, 'I believe it's done.' I don't have concrete, 100 percent proof for you guys. I wish I did, otherwise, I would have it and I would be running around with it. But I don't have that, so I want to caution everybody in Philadelphia. But that's what I was led to believe, that this thing is now decided.\"Russell then mentioned the Phillies.\"Now, what comes then is hammering out a contract. And if we were to believe the report that the Philadelphia Phillies had not even extended a formal offer -- and I assume that to be a termed, written agreement, that type of thing, which I find hard to believe -- then there might be more legwork to this. And therefore, hey the decision may be done, but the contract still needs to be ironed out.\"[RELATED: Phillies fan participates in \"lent\" in hopes of recruiting Harper]Russell is being safe with the terminology he's using, which is understandable. And while we haven't been able to confirm these rumors, Harper, along with many other free agents, remains unsigned.The Giants appeared to be the \"mystery team\" that introduced themselves late into the Harper sweepstakes -- and when the radio hosts asked Russell his opinion on where the outfielder will end up next season, he believed Harper will be in an orange and black uniform.\"I don't think it's going to be the Nationals,\" Russell said. \"I think it's going to be the San Francisco Giants, but that is not by any means an 'I know that for a fact,' so I want to caution everybody -- I know how this works -- I get in trouble with everything I say on my radio show, and everyone blows it up.\" The wait continues ... Golden State Warriors stars Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant empathised with Steve Kerr after the head coach was ejected during the loss to the Portland Trail Blazers having thrown a clipboard in response to a flagrant foul call.Kerr was enraged late in the fourth quarter when Draymond Green was called for a flagrant foul after he stopped Zach Collins from approaching the rim as he went up for a shot.That drew Kerr's ire and after ranting in one referee's face, he slammed a clipboard down to earn an ejection, with Durant having to escort his head coach back off the court.The Warriors lost the game 129-107 but will still head into the All-Star break with the best record in the Western Conference.\"It was an emotional game. We fought really hard for 43 minutes,\" Curry told reporters afterwards.\"One questionable decision - the flagrant - obviously the fire came out. You see coach go and throw a clipboard. At that point you try to get us over the hump. An eight-point swing, it's tough to overcome.\"\"I looked at the replay and the amount of ball [Green] got, there was nothing excessive about it, he got all the ball.\"There was a lot of chirping, with Zach involved. There was probably a sensitivity to it, trying to put out some fires, but I thought it was a terrible call. We obviously paid the price for it with how everything unfolded after that.\"Durant shared that sympathy having been the one to pull Kerr away from the referees as he continued to rant at them.\"I felt for him, I understand his anger and his rage, especially for that call,\" he said.\"I thought we should have just kept playing, It was a common foul, I thought. Refs looked at it differently. \"I understand why coach was a little frustrated.\"Kerr explained that it was the disbelief at the call that had triggered his reaction.\"I was just shocked that that was called a flagrant foul,\" he said. \"I'm not sure how it's determined - if it's in New York or the officials on the call - but that was head-scratching: that that could be called a flagrant foul.\"The guy's going to go in for a dunk, you've got to make sure he doesn't dunk it.\"So, I told Kenny [Mauer] that I beg to differ. There might have been a couple of other words in there too!\"I'll have to ask the owner if the clipboard broke when I threw it down. I got a little anger out so that was good. I was too busy yelling to ask for an explanation.\"Charles Barkley thinks New Orleans Pelicans star Anthony Davis made a mistake with his trade request.The 25-year-old asked the Pelicans to move him in late January and the Los Angeles Lakers had been engaged in discussions about acquiring him. But, no deal was reached before the deadline and Davis remained with New Orleans.Barkley, an 11-time All-Star who works as an analyst for TNT, said he thinks Davis and his agent, Rich Paul, mishandled the situation.\"Don't ruin your reputation as a great player, one of the nicest guys in the world,\" Barkley told reporters on Thursday ahead of All-Star weekend (via the Washington Post).\"Remember, your agent works for you, you don't work for him. They handled that situation wrong. It's going to come back to bite them in the a***. It's unfortunate.\"The six-time All-Star entered play on Thursday averaging 28.5 points and 13.1 rebounds this season. But, he scored just three points in 24 minutes on the floor in the Pelicans' 118-88 loss to the Orlando Magic earlier this week.\"This is a bad situation,\" Barkley said. \"It's a bad look for the NBA. Because that kid can't go out there and give 100 per cent because he’s worried about getting hurt. The guy's the second-best player in the world and he's got three points? That's not a good look for the NBA.\"The Boston Celtics and New York Knicks, among others, are expected to explore dealing for Davis after the season. Barkley, however, said he believes the forward will eventually land in Los Angeles because of Paul's relationship with Lakers star LeBron James.Barkley tallied 22.1 points and 11.7 rebounds per game over his 16-year career. He retired in 2000 and was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame six years later.After an apology from Sergio Garcia, a non-apology from Matt Kuchar, and an uncooperative Mother Nature on Valentine's Day, it's time for everyone to focus again on Tiger Woods. Kidding. Sort of. A weather-delayed first round at Riviera re-starts on Friday morning and the 14-time major champ will be in the Hollywood-area spotlight as he finally begins his Genesis Open. And golf fans could potentially see a LOT of the tournament host as the event tries to play catch up after heavy rains on Thursday.Woods, Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas (Decent group, eh?) are scheduled to tee off at 8:32 local time (11:32 ET). The hope is they will complete their first rounds and then play as much of their second rounds as possible before darkness. And Tiger's hope is to finally win for the first time at this historic layout where he missed the cut last year. We'll be tracking Tiger every step of the way so keep it right here for the latest scores, news and highlights. (All times eastern)SATURDAY, 11:25: With a 25-foot birdie putt on No. 9, Woods' final hole of the second round, Tiger will likely make the cut. The birdie brought Woods back to even on his round and to one under overall.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096808527694245890After resuming play in the morning, Woods bogeyed his first hole, No. 4, then made four pars before his finishing birdie. His playing partners, however, fared much better. Justin Thomas shares the lead with Adam Scott at 11 under and Rory McIlroy birdied four of his six holes on Saturday morning to shoot 63 and move to seven under through 36 holes. Thursday's early wave is now on the course for their second rounds.-------------------FRIDAY-------------------8:25: And with that, the horn has sounded—play will be suspended for darkness on Friday at Riviera. Tiger, JT and Rory have six more holes to complete their second round. Justin Thomas is at 10-under, tied with Adam Scott for the lead. Tiger will hope Saturday brings some different momentum for him—as this marathon day ends with two bogeys in a row after the highlight eagle.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10965708926692065298:21: That's back-to-back bogeys now for Tiger Woods, dropping another shot here at the third hole (his 12th of the round). And over his past six holes, Tiger has four bogeys. The birdie at No. 1 helped negate most of that damage ... but Tiger's back to 1-under again—right on the current cut line.8:13: On his 30th hole of the day, Tiger is showing some obvious signs of being tired. And who could blame him—he's been playing golf for nearly 10 hours straight. From 165 yards out at the third hole, Tiger Woods tries to chop out a 6-iron and comes out of it. His ball comes to rest short of the green. With sunset in Pacific Palisades being 5:30 local time, this group will have time for maybe one more hole today.8:04: Tiger follows up that eagle putt at No. 1 with a bogey at the second hole. The third bogey of his second round moves Tiger back to 2-under overall.7:56: After a long wait at the second hole, Tiger sprays his second shot from 235 out with a fairway wood out to the right. He'll have his work cut out from the front right bunker to save par at the 482-yard par 4.7:40: This is exactly what Tiger Woods needed: He rolls in his 43-foot eagle putt at his 10th hole (the first) to get back to 3-under—negating those two bogeys he made on his front nine. What a putt! With the flagstick in!https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096570892669206529Tiger made a disappointing par to open his first round earlier today at the first hole. The unlikely eagle makes up for that effort—and could turn around Tiger's second round in a dramatic way. Tiger goes from toeing the cut line at 1-under to now all of a sudden being T-21.7:28: Tiger finds the fairway at the par-5 first hole, the group's 10th hole of their second round, as he attempts to get a shot back here after bogeying two of his final three holes on his front nine. Neither bogey was particularly bad—the 18th hole is playing brutally tough right now uphill and into the wind with the rain, making it even more of a challenging hole. And his break at 16 was very unlucky.7:16: Tiger and JT are gonna have their work cut out to save par at the 18th hole (their ninth). Each player had fairway wood approaches and tried playing a big cut. JT was way up left on the hill—Tiger was closer. He went high with his approach and will have about 11 feet left for par.Tiger misses the par putt, so he'll drop a shot along with JT as they make the turn. Tiger moves back to 1-under after 27 holes. That's where the cut line currently is—so all of a sudden, Tiger must be concerned about making the cut.7:01: Following Justin Thomas throwing a dart at the 17th to about 3 feet, Tiger puts his wedge shot from under 100 yards to outside 20 feet, so he'll be disappointed with that effort. The birdie putt misses on the high side, and Tiger taps in for par to remain at 2-under. His playing partner and buddy Justin Thomas stays hot, rolling in a fourth straight birdie to get to 9-under—tied for the lead with Adam Scott. Really impressive golf here from JT.6:54: The rain is really coming down now as the players head to the 17th hole. Tiger finds the fairway at the par-5 17th hole, but it was a short one—he has 326 yards left. Most players have been laying up at this par 5 all day.6:43: From a brutal position up against the back lip of the bunker, Tiger hacks it out—and somehow keeps the ball on the green, albeit the back portion. His par attempt from 44 feet away here comes up three feet shy. Tiger makes his bogey to move back to 2-under.Meanwhile, Justin Thomas is officially on fire. He has another birdie after a fabulous tee shot at 16. It's now two Kentucky boys tied at the top: Justin Thomas and J.B. Holmes (-8).https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10965576791939317766:39: Tiger will have serious lie issues at the par-3 16th hole. His tee shot came to rest up against the back lip of the bunker. As Billy Kratzert just remarked on PGA Tour Live, Tiger will do well just to keep this ball on the green. Though he avoided dropping a shot on his last hole, there might be a bogey in his future here.6:35: A clutchhh par save by Tiger at the 15th hole makes up for his poor chip—and Tiger keeps the momentum going on his second round, as he stays 3-under for the tournament and 2-under on the round.Justin Thomas, also in Tiger's group, holed out from in front of the green for birdie at the 14th hole, and he makes a long birdie putt at 15 to get to 7-under—just one back of fellow Kentucky native J.B. Holmes.6:32: A poor chip shot from Tiger at the 15th hole leaves him about 13 feet away. He'll need to convert that putt to prevent dropping his first shot of his second round.6:24: Tiger finds another fairway here at Riviera, this one at the 15th hole. The guy is feeeling it with his driver. Almost on auto pilot. His approach from 190 out turns a little too much, finding the rough to the left of the green. He'll have to get up and down to avoid dropping one here.6:20: From 20 feet out, Tiger's birdie bid comes up shy—never really scaring the hole, despite getting a good look at the line from Rory's putt. Tiger taps in for par to remain at 3-under.The putter has been disappointing for Tiger all day: He had 34 putts in his first round, including four three-putts, just the third time in his career he's done that.6:13: Tiger puts his tee shot at the par-3 14th hole just inside Rory's ball—about 20 feet right of the hole. He'll get a little teach from Rory's putt, too, as Tiger continues to hit it well today.6:07: Tiger just misses the left-to-right curling bid for birdie, leaving himself with an easy par at 13. He stays 3-under for the tournament and -2 through four on his round.Tiger's playing partners are also playing well—Rory has three birdies in his first four holes to get to 2-under. Look out for Rory at rainy Riviera. And Justin Thomas, despite hitting his tee shot out of bounds at 13, got up and down from 160 yards to avoid dropping multiple shots. He's now 5-under after that bogey.6:02: Another grooved tee shot for Tiger Woods at the 13th hole puts him in good position. He turned over his tee shot—putting his draw in the middle of the fairway at the dogleg left. Tiger spins his approach back to about 15 feet, just off the green in the fringe. He'll have a chance to knock another one here and keep the momentum going.5:51: Bang! Tiger nails the 25-footer for birdie at the 12th hole to add a second birdie to his card through three holes. Realistically, too, it could be three straight birdies for Tiger. But the 14-time major champion is now 2-under through 3—T-3 for the tournament (T-19)—and carries some strong momentum on his side at the start of his second round ... as the rain is coming down at Riviera.5:46: Tiger hits his approach hole high—about 25 feet from 181 yards. He'll have another chance to add a birdie to his third round.Tiger's currently at 2-under, which puts him at T-29. The projected cut is at 1-under—so he's comfortably inside the number as of now. But there's a ton of golf to be played, obviously.5:41: Tiger finds the fairway with his driver at the par-4 12th hole. The 12th usually plays as one of the toughest holes at Riviera—we'll see if Tiger can take advantage of his position here in the fairway.5:33: An excellent fairway-wood second shot by Tiger put him right in front of the par-5 11th green in two. But a very poor approach putt for his third leaves him more than 10 feet away. His birdie try slides by for a very disappointing par being so close in 2. That should've been a golden opportunity to start his second round with two birdies—instead, Tiger stays at 2-under.5:12: Tiger goes high with his pitch—having to navigate around the front bunker, and plays it nicely—spinning it about 7 feet short of the hole. So Tiger will have a good look for an opening birdie to start his second round. Tiger converts the birdie putt to move to 2-under.5:02: Only a little more than a half hour after finishing his first round, Tiger Woods (-1) -- along with Justin Thomas (-5) and Rory McIlroy (+1) -- has teed off in his second round. The group started on the drivable 10th hole, and Tiger has driven his tee shot just off the green. He'll have a chance to put his pitch shot close to start his second round with a birdie.4:24: Tiger narrowly misses the birdie putt at the 18th hole, so he'll tap in for a par and an opening-round, one-under 70 at Riviera. Having three-putted for a fourth time on the 17th hole to drop a shot in disappointing fashion, Tiger will head to his second round a bit frustrated. But the four consecutive birdies showed him being able to score well at Riviera, where he has never won.Tiger, JT (who birdied 18 to finish at 5-under) and Rory will head right back for their second round in this marathon day for them.4:18: Tiger responds to that shocking three-putt with a perfect drive and a towering 6-iron on Riviera's famed 18th. Woods is in good shape to at least make par the difficult hole, but as we've seen all day, a two-putt is anything but automatic.Here's an unusual stat on Tiger three-putting four times this afternoon. He's making some history in a bad way...https://twitter.com/JustinRayGolf/status/10965196250582507574:06: So much for the momentum. . . After a decent approach shot that spins back to about 20 feet, Woods runs his birdie putt a couple feet by and. . . gulp. . . misses the comebacker from about two feet. Wow. That's four three-putts on the day as Tiger falls back to one under with one hole to play.3:57: Uh-oh, it's raining in southern California again. Meanwhile, Woods is plodding his way up the par-5 17th. After pulling his drive into the left rough and drawing a poor lie, Woods pushed his layup slightly into the first cut of the right rough. He'll have a some sort of wedge to a back-right hole location.3:50: Tiger's tee shot was tracking on the par-3 16th, but it comes up about 30 feet short. From there, he two-putts for par to remain at two under. Justin Thomas makes his 10-foot birdie effort to move to four under, while Rory McIlroy remains at one over. McIlroy hast two holes to avert his first over-par score of 2019.3:40: After another great drive and a solid approach, Woods races his birdie attempt nearly five feet past the hole. But he keeps the overall positive momentum going by converting the par putt to remain at two under. Tiger has three more holes to play. At least, before he gets a lunch break.3:24: BANG! There's the bounce back from Tiger. It just came one hole later. And from farther away as Woods drains his 12-footer for birdie on No. 14.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096507996031467520Woods is now back to two under, five shots behind Jordan Spieth, who has to be pleased to still be in front by two despite these soft conditions.3:17: Tiger hits a great shot on the difficult par-3 14th hole to about 15 feet. He'll have a good look at birdie coming up. In the meantime, here's a look at how the leader board stands with Jordan Spieth still leading the way.Jordan Spieth (-7) 2t. Tony Finau (-5) 2t. Patrick Rodgers (-5) 2t. Kramer Hickok (-5) 2t. Davis Love III (-5) 2t. Adam Scott (-5) 2t. J.B. Homes (-5)Click here for full scores.3:13: Woods stuck his approach to about four feet below the hole on No. 13. A bounce back birdie looked like a forgone conclusion until he pushed his effort. Woof. That's two three-putts and two short misses on the greens for Tiger today. He remains at one under. Meanwhile, Rory McIlroy, after getting to two under through eight, has fallen to one over after back-to-back bogeys. Justin Thomas, the third player in the group, continues to lead this trio at three under.3:05: After hitting fade after fade, Woods steps to the 13th tee and rips a draw around the corner, perfectly setting up his next shot. Good to see him working it both ways with ease.3:01: Tiger pushed his tee shot into the right rough, then hit a fantastic recovery shot from a thick lie onto the green. He had a long look at birdie that rolled about four feet past, leaving him with a tricky left-to-right par putt, which he missed. That's three three putts on the day for Woods, and he's still one under.2:39: Not the best chip from Woods, as he left himself about six feet for birdie, but he makes it anyway. Four straight for Tiger to get to two under for the day.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10964952191957975042:30: Woods rips a 3-wood from 269 to just in front of the green. Hate to jinx him, but there's no reason he shouldn't easily make his fourth straight birdie here (ducks).2:20: Three in a row for Woods as he rolls in another at No. 10 and moves to one under. If he finds the fairway again at the 11th, four in a row will be in his sights. Meanwhile, Rory makes his par to stay at one under and JT ends up holing his 10 footer for birdie to get to four under. Finally a little bit of JUICE from this threesome.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096489287753711616https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096489787672780800By the way, it looks like we know when they'll be heading back out for round two later today. Here's an update from the Tiger Tracker:https://twitter.com/GCTigerTracker/status/1096481806067523585That should give them enough time to get at least 11 or 12 holes in.At the 11th, Woods stripes another drive down the fairway. He's really starting to cook.2:12: Tiger's shot was a tad more difficult than we thought, as he had to avoid a bunker and take it up high to get it back to the pin. He was successful, sticking it to about three feet. Hell of a shot. Even better was Rory's shot, as he flopped it from a nice lie and got it to hang on just off the back of the green and stay out of the back bunker. Thomas, who had the easiest shot, put too much spin on his chip, leaving himself with about 10 feet for birdie.2:07: Finally, Tiger, Rory and JT hit their tee shots, and it looks like the ensuing entertainment will be well worth the wait. Tiger is in the collection area left of the green, where he has a straightforward chip that should set him up with a good chance to make birdie. Thomas is just in front of the green, and he'll have a great chance to make a birdie as well. Rory ... um ... not so much. He's in the rough with a greenside bunker in front of him and a pin he won't be able to get close to, and just holding the green would be a miracle.1:52: Woods drains his four-footer for bird and turns in even par 35. Real strong finish to his opening nine, and now it looks like he'll have a long wait at the 10th. DeChambeau, Kuchar and Rahm have still yet to hit their tee shots.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/10964831254067896321:47: Tiger had just 122 left to the green and stuck one in there close. He has four feet left for birdie to turn in even par, which would be a small victory after that ugly three putt back at No. 7. Not to mention he'll have a prime opportunity to get into red figures at the driveable par-4 10th.1:41: Woods cranks another high fade right down the middle with the driver at No. 9. With the tees up today, he'll have a low iron in his hand for his approach.1:34: And he's on the board! Woods bounces back with a birdie putt from 15 feet, getting him back to one over. We'll see if that gets him going before making the turn.1:30: From 125 yards out, Woods hit a wedge and hated it from the second he made contact. While he did pull it, he's still hole high and inside 20 feet. Hideki Matsuyama-esque move from Tiger.1:24: Woods rips one right down the middle at the par-4 eighth. Should have a short iron in.1:15: Tiger's birdie putt was actually from just off the green on the fringe, and he rolled it by some four feet. Then, he missed the comebacker for par, dropping to two over on the day. Oof.1:09: Fairway and a green for Woods at the seventh. Good look at birdie coming up to get back to level par.12:58: Another hole, another par for Woods, who two-putted from 24 feet on the par-3 sixth. In the group up ahead, though, Jon Rahm is making a move at three under through six.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/109646557828021452912:47: Another meh hole for Tiger on No. 5, just missing the fairway with his tee shot, finding the front of the green with a so-so approach, and two-putting for another par from 43 feet. Woods remains at one over through five holes while his playing partners, McIlroy and Thomas, both remain at one under.12:42: As Matt Kuchar's ball is in the air on the par-3 sixth, a fan yells, \"Go low—just not with the gratuity!\" Despite Matt maintaining this is \"not a story,\" it is. And this won't be the last comment like this.12:29: Woods hit a nice shot to about 15 feet on the par-3 fourth, but ran his birdie effort by the hole. Still one over. Still no highlights. At least, from Tiger. Here was Spieth's closing birdie from about an hour ago, because there is not much else exciting going on right now.https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/109644546143346688112:17: Another missed fairway and another short approach from Tiger on the par-4 third. Although, Woods found the putting surface, he was unable to two-putt from 63 feet, missing a seven-footer for par after badly misreading his first putt. That drops Tiger to one over through three holes. Not a lot of highlights so far. . .12:02: Tiger misses right off the tee on No. 2 then comes up short on another approach. But his pitch shot nearly goes down, leaving him with a tap-in par. Even par through two holes.11:49: After that perfect opening tee shot, Tiger hit a hideous approach with a 5-iron that came up way short in a fairway bunker. From there, he hit his third to 10 feet but missed the putt to walk away with a disappointing par. Both of Tiger's playing partners, McIlroy and Thomas, make birdie.11:38: Matt Kuchar just misses his eagle attempt from 25 feet on No. 1, but taps in for birdie. Kuchar has been in the news a lot this week over a caddie controversy dating back to his win at the Mayakoba Golf Classic. A controversy he didn't help with his comments on Wednesday. Is it possible some of those \"Kuuuuch\" shouts will turn to \"Mooooch\"? Kinda sounded like it on the first hole. . .11:34: Jordan Spieth is in with a seven-under-par 64 to take the early lead. Spieth needed only 21 putts during his bogey-free round. Of course, starting tournaments hasn't been a problem for Spieth of late. Finishing, however, has been a different story. Incredibly, Spieth is looking for his first win since the 2017 British Open and his first top 5 since last year's Masters.11:32: Woods smashes a driver off the first tee that finds the fairway. The opening par 5 at Riviera is essentially a long par 4 and one of the easiest holes on the PGA Tour all year so Tiger is thinking at least birdie after that tee shot.10:53: So far, so good on the Friday weather:https://twitter.com/GCTigerTracker/status/1096437235262533632And with lift, clean and place in play (for at least the first round), low scores are out there. Let's set the over/under on the Par-71 layout at 68.5.10:45: We are approximately 45 minutes away from Tiger's tee time and it's another major champ who is already off to a fantastic start. Jordan Spieth has the lead at six under through 15 holes. Spieth leads Patrick Rodgers by one and then there's a big group at four under, including Bill Haas, who is playing in the event a year after being involved in a car accident during last year's tournament that killed a friend he was staying with. Make sure you read Brian Wacker's piece from earlier in the week on how Haas is still trying to move on from that tragedy.10:35: As we move within an hour from Tiger teeing off, check out GOLFTV's latest behind-the-scenes video with Woods in which he says his bag has up to 16(!) golf gloves during rainy rounds and he explains why he doesn't like wearing rain jackets:https://twitter.com/GOLFTV/status/1096246456795697153\"Pops used to say, 'Once you're wet, you're wet.

Once he started running the front office, his blinking at Paul George on national TV contributed to the Lakers getting fined again for tampering. Johnson’s praise of Giannis Antetokounmpo drew yet another tampering fine.So, though he escaped punishment for his recent comments on 76ers guard Ben Simmons, Johnson refused to answer a question about Hornets guard Kemba Walker.Carolina Blitz:Asked Magic about Kemba and he said y’all aren’t going to catch him slipping anymore. pic.twitter.com/sQZtIWnQbn— Carolina Blitz (@KeepBlitzin) February 15, 2019Johnson:You know I can’t answer any questions about no players, because every time I do it, I get fined. But anybody else do it, they don’t get fined. So I’m going to stay away from that one.I don’t blame Johnson for feeling that way.Other teams’ owners, coaches and executives have repeatedly publicly discussed rival players without facing announced punishment.To be fair, the NBA doesn’t reveal every fine. Bucks owner Marc Lasry reportedly just got fined for tampering, but the league never announced it. But, at minimum, there’s an inconsistency with how the NBA exposes Johnson’s transgressions.Even NBA commissioner Adam Silver said last year there’s a spotlight on the Lakers due to prior tampering. That strikes me as unfair. The Lakers already paid for their prior violations and should now be held to the same standard as everyone else.And for what it’s worth, I wish that standard allowed an all-time great point guard like Johnson to publicly share his thoughts on Kemba Walker.Gareth Bale has landed himself in hot water after La Liga denounced the Real Madrid star for his celebration in the Madrid derby, which could carry a ban of four to 12 games.The Welsh forward scored as a substitute in the 3-1 victory over Atletico Madrid, bringing up his 100th goal for the club.And during the celebrations that followed, Bale \"lifted his right arm near his head in a clear sign of provocation towards the fans, then giving a gesture which could be seen as obscene and disdainful by folding his arm and striking it with his other hand.\"In a statement released by La Liga, Bale’s punishment will be decided by whether he incited the crowd or not.If Bale is guilty of “inciting opposition fans” to cause a hostile reaction, the punishment could carry four to 12 games, if there was no hostile reaction but intent, then it could be as little as one to three games.The gesture is referred to in Spain as ‘corte de mangas,’ with the moment not picked up in the referee’s match report.A committee will now decide whether the gesture merits a punishment.Bale also featured in Real’s Champions League victory over Ajax.Los Blancos take a 2-1 lead back to the Bernabeu for the second leg of the last 16 tie after Marco Asensio’s late winner.Earlier this week Heisman Trophy winner — and first round draft pick of the Oakland Athletics — Kyler Murray chose football over baseball, committing himself to the NFL draft. It was a move that, however sensible from Murray’s point of view, has led to a lot of soul-searching among baseball folks and has raised questions about what the sport offers young, talented athletes with other options.It’s not that bleak, however! Another outstanding college football player said no to football this week and reaffirmed his commitment to baseball. Tim Tebow! From PFT:One Florida Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback will not be coaching another in the Alliance of American Football.Steve Spurrier, the Florida Heisman winner who later coached the Gators to a national championship and is now head coach of the AAF’s Orlando Apollos, said this morning on PFT Live that after the AAF briefly reached out to Tebow in the ball, it became clear that Tebow’s focus is on playing baseball.Ok, so maybe Tebow is not turning down quite the football opportunity that Murray would’ve been.

In the last month alone he's won his 44th PGA Tour event, finished second in another, hit every fairway in a round for the first time in 21 years, shot a 60, pulled off this impossible recovery shot, gone viral just by rolling his eyes and said he might drop the Players from his schedule because he's already won it (a literal mic drop). The man simply cannot be stopped right now.Leave it to the weather to literally rain on Lefty's parade. On Thursday at the Genesis Open, Mickelson began his first round at the difficult short par-4 10th and drove into one of the bunkers up near the green, leaving him with a dreaded lengthy sand shot. He wound up hitting it over the green, and his ball plugged in the back bunker, setting up an even harder shot than he just had. As you'll hear PGA Tour Live commentator Shane Bacon say, avoiding making a six was probably the goal, but after Mickelson hit his third into another bunker on the other side of the green, a six suddenly became best-case scenario. How does a four sound instead?https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1096076528142626818Find us a more Phil Mickelson par ever... you can't. He's always got a flair for the dramatic. The problem?

(Old man golfers)The dust is barely settled in the wake of the end of the Markelle Fultz era in Philadelphia, and the former 76ers guard is already taking shots at his old team.His old coach Brett Brown in particular.Fultz had his introductory press conference with the Orlando Magic on Thursday after being traded at last week’s deadline and praised his new coach Steve Clifford while taking a veiled shot at Brown.“It just excites me to know that I have a coach that’s going to push you to be better and not just going to tell you what you want to hear,” Fultz said.That’s direct praise for his new coach. But the message for Brown is clear. Fultz didn’t like what he heard from the Philadelphia coaching staff.Fultz never had any public dispute with the 76ers, but it was evident that he and the team had different approaches to the struggles that saw him shoot 41.4 percent from the field, 26.7 percent from 3-point distance and 53.4 percent from the line in limited action after being selected as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2017 draft.It’s still not clear whether injury or a mental block – or both – are the cause of his shooting issues.After his agent announced that the nerve disorder thoracic outlet syndrome was the root of the shooting woes, Fultz never played again for the 76ers.[Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today]Fultz appears to be fully embracing the fresh start in Orlando as a player and a person.“I think the biggest thing we talked about what doing thing the right way,” Fultz said. “Just building me up both as a man and on the court. I think that’s music to my ears, really just. Two things I really want to do is be the best player I can be and be the best young man I can be.”Fultz described the experience of his nerve disorder to reporters.“It’s hard to lift up your arms, you lose feeling in your fingers,” Fultz said. “You can’t tell when it’s going to happen. It’s not like you do the same motion every time. You get tingling in your fingers, numbness. Stuff like that.”He also curtly dismissed any notion that his shooting struggles are due to anything but injury.“I had an injury,” Fultz said. “I was out there trying to play through that. I never lost confidence.”Asked about a timetable to return, Fultz dodged the question to talk about rehab.“Right now it’s just about getting everything the right way,” he said. “Rehab’s been going great. I’m just taking my time and doing everything the right way.”More from Yahoo Sports: • PGA Tour pro defends paying caddie $5K on $1.3M win • NFL bars NCAA’s all-time sack leader from combine • Only one NBA team failed to scout Antetokounmpo • Black History honor for Kaepernick sacked by lawmakers He might not be well known to NFL fans at large, but New England Patriots fans know linebacker Kyle Van Noy — acquired basically for free from the Detroit Lions at the 2016 trade deadline — has been a big part of the defense the last two years, and has a knack for making plays at the right time.Van Noy is getting a little shine after winning his second Super Bowl ring with New England, appearing on the “Pardon My Take” podcast on Thursday to dish on all things Patriots and Super Bowl LIII.One thing that Van Noy revealed: the Los Angeles Rams didn’t do anything surprising during the game on offense.“I couldn’t believe that,” Van Noy said. “They really didn’t do — not one wrinkle. I was like, ‘What the hell?’ They’ve got so many good players, they’ve got so many things they’ve done all year, and the one play they gave us which was a wrinkle was the [Brandin] Cooks screen that hit for a little bit.“And that was it… Or maybe too, we were playing so good they were like, ‘[Expletive], we don’t know what to do.’ ”Hindsight, of course, is 20-20, but given that the Patriots’ coaching staff is known for having its players prepared for any and everything, it seems unwise that Los Angeles didn’t add some new plays or looks to try to stump New England.Van Noy said the Patriots’ culture, specifically coach Bill Belichick’s practice of not sparing anyone in the film room, even Tom Brady, is part of why the team continues to win.“Oh yeah. Yeah, that [stuff is] sick, to be honest, because it sets the table,” Van Noy said. “Like, OK, it doesn’t matter who you are, everyone’s on an even playing field. This is how it is here at work. You come in and you earn everything.“And I respect that because I felt like that gave me a chance to get on the field when I came in mid-year, and [Belichick] was like, ‘It doesn’t matter who you are or what you’ve done. You earn your keep.’ ”More from Yahoo Sports: • Report: Kaepernick wanted massive deal to play in AAF • Super Bowl-swindling fugitive caught being rude to teen spa worker • Racial taunt of HS basketball player leads to outrage • Steph Curry regrets putting daughter Riley in NBA Finals spotlight The Brady Conundrum: How do you go about replacing the GOAT? originally appeared on nbcsportsboston.comThe Patriots hatched a Tom Brady succession plan after the 2013 season when they drafted Jimmy Garoppolo.Brady blew that up.Now, five years, four Super Bowl appearances, three Super Bowl wins, two Super Bowl MVPs and a regular-season MVP later, it's time to gingerly -- caaaauuuuuutiooooousssssllllyyyyy -- begin the process again.This time should be different.Even though Brady's contract hasn't been extended past the 2019 season, the love and happiness we saw on the field after the Rams were dispatched in SB53 is a good sign.MORE PATRIOTSAreas of Change: Will Pats be able to retain free agents Trey Flowers and Trent Brown?Brady's wariness about the Patriots' plans for him, and Bill Belichick's wariness about wedding his team to a quarterback who's closer to 50 years old than he is to 30, has dissipated.Once a new deal is in place -- Jonathan Kraft indicated that might be before training camp, though as of the Super Bowl conversations hadn't started -- Brady will have a written assurance that he will leave the Patriots and the NFL on his terms.That wasn't the case in early 2014 when the soon-to-be-37-year-old Brady saw the Patriots spend a first-round pick on a defensive tackle (Dominique Easley) and their second-rounder on Garoppolo. That, after a '13 season Brady spent throwing to the likes of Aaron Dobson, Josh Boyce, Kenbrell Thompkins and Austin Collie.Garoppolo was a stick of dynamite under Brady's behind. He was the existential threat Brady feared made flesh.Jimmy might have thought he was drafted to learn how to play quarterback in the NFL and have a nice career. To Brady, Garoppolo was there to take his job, throw his career into upheaval, uproot his family and see Brady cast out into the NFL wilderness.MORE PATRIOTSPerry: If Beckham is on the trade block, should Patriots be willing to pay the price?And, in contrast to the guy Brady succeeded in 2001 (and, by extension, did all those things to), Brady wasn't going to snort derisively at the plucky little draft pick here to take his job. He would crush the threat.He did.Brady played so well that -- despite Garoppolo developing into a bona-fide front-line quarterback under Belichick and Josh McDaniels (and Brady) -- Brady left the ever-prepared Patriots with no recourse when Garoppolo's contract was about to expire.Brady was too good to bench and too important to trade. Garoppolo was too expensive to franchise and too smart to take a \"bridge\" contract so he could watch Brady from the sidelines while his own hair started to gray at the temples. So off he went around Halloween, 2017.A lot's happened in the 16 months since.MORE PATRIOTSPhil Perry's Mock Draft 1.0: Pats start looking for Gronk's replacementBut now here we are, in the offseason of Brady's 42nd year. And the complex question of how to find the player who will eventually replace the greatest quarterback in NFL history still lingers.Do you draft his successor? If you do, do you do it this year? Do you do it next year?Do you try to get into the top 10 to get your pick of the litter? Do you stay put, confident that the muttonheads across the league will miss out as they did with Brady and Garoppolo (or Aaron Rodgers, Russell Wilson, Drew Brees, Brett Favre, Johnny Unitas . . . you get the point)? How much will it cost to get into the top 10? Do you package picks from this season -- when you will have six in the first three rounds -- and pick a sucker who will suck next year and fleece them for their 2020 first-rounder? How high do you have to go for a blue-chip, given the number of first-round quarterbacks that will be taken this year and that were taken in 2018?Is it a trade for somebody another team's given up on or has no work for, like San Francisco's Nick Mullens? A veteran who will hit free agency like Nick Foles, Case Keenum or Teddy Bridgewater?How does the successor play the position? Similar to Brady in that brain/eyes/accuracy/commitment trumps legs/arm strength/versatility?MORE PATRIOTSShould Pats be interested in Demaryius Thomas? No . . . and yesOr is there an embrace of the fact that trying to find a quarterback similar to a guy who came into the league after four years at Michigan at the end of last century with a once-in-a-lifetime work ethic is a pipe dream?Aside from who the successor is and how he plays, can Brady -- the lion in winter -- be tapped to help groom whoever is being brought aboard to take over?Brady -- contrary to sexed-up speculation -- didn't actively undermine Garoppolo at any point. They were teammates. He helped Garoppolo play the position better. They became close. But he wasn't quite showing him his world, either. Brady is famous for saying he's not giving away his secrets to younger quarterbacks until after he's done.With the end-date likely to be agreed upon when he signs an extension, does he become more a mentor so that the success of the franchise has a better chance to continue after he leaves? Would the Patriots want him to do that?Or would they want a blank(ish) slate to work with that isn't saying, \"But Tom said . . . \" when they try to shape him to succeed?And that contract? What's it look like? Does Brady demand pay commensurate with what he's accomplished? Is he in the mood to do the team another financial solid given the only bump they have him in 2018 was incentives he never reached? How does that impact the structure of the team?These questions aren't new. What is new is the level of angst and anxiousness. It's dissipated tremendously.That won't make finding his replacement or choosing the means by which the Patriots will do it any easier. But it's less fraught now.The irony is, the Patriots already successfully found Brady's successor. It's just that 2014 was too soon to go looking for him.Now, can they do it again?Click here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!

Before the team's loss to the Blazers on Wednesday night, he told ESPN that he \"wants to finish his career as a Warrior.\"      View this post on Instagram    Klay wants to stay in The Bay.A post shared by  espn (@espn) on Feb 13, 2019 at 9:23pm PSTThompson is set to be an unrestricted free agent at the end of the 2018-19 season.This isn't the first time Klay has made his feelings known. Even his father Mychal, who played five seasons for the Lakers, believes his son will re-sign with the Warriors. [RELATED: For Steve Kerr, Steph Curry and Klay Thompson are mix of NBA past and present]The Warriors selected Thompson with the No. 11 overall pick in the 2011 NBA Draft. Since then, he's been a five-time NBA All-Star, three-time Finals champion and two-time All-NBA selection. Anything could happen, but it's safe to say the Klay and the Dubs have quite the relationship and are ready to tie the knot.Jason Witten never worked with Kellen Moore as a coach, but he did practice with Moore when both of them were still active players with the Cowboys.That experience is enough for Witten to think Moore has “a way about him” that will pay off in his new job as the Cowboys offensive coordinator. Witten said this week that he believes Moore will be innovative and that the offense will take a “big step” by gearing things around quarterback Dak Prescott.“Yeah, I think he will do the things that Dak likes to do,” Witten said, via the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. “He will do the things they have to do to win. That is the way they have to play. I think they will use the pass to set up the run. Not just the run to set up the pass. I think he will add some nice wrinkles to that offense.”With head coach Jason Garrett coaching in the final year of his contract, Moore’s work with the offense will have a lot to do with how Dallas does in 2019 and with the path the team charts in the years that follow. If Witten’s correct, that path will probably look a lot like the one they’ve been on for a while.The story of Danny Ainge's Greece visit to watch Giannis Antetokounmpo is a wild one originally appeared on nbcsportsboston.comThe Boston Celtics took an early interest in Greece basketball star Giannis Antetokounmpo before he was selected in the 2013 NBA Draft.C's president of basketball operations Danny Ainge actually went over to Europe to watch Antetokounmpo play, and the postgame scene was nothing short of crazy.Fans were going wild, and some of them even yelled at Ainge because they thought he was associated with Antetokounmpo's team -- Ainge was sitting near its bench during the game.Check out the video below to hear the wild story of Ainge's scouting visit to Greece:Time for another \"Finding Giannis\" outtake. The first NBA team to scout Giannis was the Boston Celtics. As is often the case in Greece, hilarity ensued, as told by @GrgpanouOCT about Danny Ainge's visit. #FindingGiannis will be broadcasted Saturday on TNT at 630pm EST. pic.twitter.com/8bLjIjHv77— Jonathan Givony (@DraftExpress) February 14, 2019The Celtics liked what they saw from Antetokounmpo, but they decided to take Gonzaga forward/center Kelly Olynyk with their 2013 first-round pick instead. The C's made a trade with the Dallas Mavericks (who owned the No. 13 pick) to select Olynyk, whose ability to handle the ball and shoot well from the outside as a big man was appealing.Antetokounmpo ultimately was taken by the Milwaukee Bucks with the 15th pick. The \"Greek Freak\" has since become one of the league's best players and arguably is the leading candidate for MVP this season. It's still hard to fault Ainge and other executives for passing on Antetokounmpo, though. He was a very raw talent, and other players in that draft class were expected to provide more immediate contributions.Click here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!

They run the same plays over and over again. All they do is flop and shoot free throws. Maybe they’re even ruining basketball. Who isn’t these days, right?Houston’s offense operates with rigid discipline. The Rockets run and run James Harden off screens until he finds a tenable matchup to exploit. Tenable, so we’re clear, is a loosely defined term for a player who only needs a sliver of space to shoot from anywhere on the floor, whose combined ball-handling and strength psychs out defenders and referees alike.It is repetitive, sure, but in a way that’s endlessly fascinating. The Rockets repeatedly put the ball in the hands of the one of the NBA’s most creative, destructive scorers and wait for him to find a sieve — or create one. Harden now holds the second-longest 30-point scoring streak in NBA history, breaking 31 games in Wednesday night’s loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves, and he’s averaging a league-scorching 36.5 points per game.I’d argue all that makes the Rockets more watchable than most teams, which dilly-dally for possessions at a time, only looking to optimize in the face of urgency. You won’t find any freewheeling action from Iguodala-types in Houston. Even Austin Rivers has (mostly) held himself in check. Every time I turn on a Rockets game, Harden or Chris Paul has possession of the ball and is on the cusp of doing something. The game becomes a successive highlight reel that doesn’t allow you to turn the dial.The same quality that makes the Rockets so entertaining right now — and will likely garner Harden a second MVP — might be what hurts them in the playoffs again. The fuse is burning bright: Harden holds the ball an average of 9.6 seconds when he touches it, the highest mark in the NBA. His usage rate is 39 percent, smashing second place by 7 percent. What Harden’s doing might not be the best idea for the Rockets’ future outlook.But it’s definitely not boring. Even on defense, an opponent can make a name for himself with a signature moment against Harden — just ask Josh Okogie.As for as Harden’s high free-throw attempts bogging the game down, I won’t be convinced that a generation that cuts away to their iPhone screen 50 times per day is that bothered by an opportunity to look away from the action. When Harden’s playing, it’s the only chance you’re going to get.Because it seems like it, at least in the East. For the past few weeks, the dominant Warriors storyline has been about how Kevin Durant’s impending free agency could impact their title run. After a win against the Utah Jazz two nights ago, Durant said he feels the team is not playing well. These are the same Warriors, mind you, who are 16-3 since the New Year. Not only have they won all 11 games DeMarcus Cousins has played in — they’ve blown the tops off buildings, outscoring opponents by 9.7 points per 100 possessions. Until July 1, Warriors inevitability reigns.Why is it, then, that the Eastern Conference is littered with high-end teams that made big bets on winning this year? The Boston Celtics made their bed a while ago, with Kyrie Irving’s contract expiring when the season ends. The Toronto Raptors traded franchise cornerstone DeMar DeRozan for a chance to woo Kawhi Leonard for a season. Then they doubled down by trading for Marc Gasol. In sum, the 76ers exchanged Jerryd Bayless, Robert Covington, Dario Saric, Wilson Chandler, Mike Muscala, Landry Shamet, two first-round picks and two second-round picks for Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris, a pair of stars with deals that expire at the end of the year.(Side note: At least one of these three teams has to flame out in the second round. And then what does it do? For once, the playoff drama will be in the East, if not the title.)Could it be possible that the Warriors are so dominant that they’ve convinced the rest of the NBA to change the goalposts of ultimate success? Because as it stands right now, we’ve got a set of teams that went all in on trying to get to second place. It feels more like they’re auditioning for a post-Warriors future than trying to succeed in the current landscape. Even in a world where success is narrowly defined by wins and losses, perception is everything. And some things are inherent: If the rest of the NBA can’t compete against the Warriors, they still can’t help but compete against themselves.The aftermath of the most emboldened trade request in recent NBA history has been ugly. Anthony Davis is not a Laker — or a Knick or a Celtic or a Buck for that matter. And the New Orleans Pelicans don’t seem to have much use for him either. They’d rather sit him and pile up losses, focus on the lottery race and protect Davis’ health so they can trade him in the offseason. But the NBA issued a directive: The Pelicans would be fined $100,000 for every game he sat.So it is that after playing well enough to keep the Pelicans in it, Davis was benched in the fourth quarter two games in a row. Then, against the Orlando Magic, they got blown out by 30 points, which led to Davis — chef’s kiss — criticizing the team’s effort. So things aren’t good. What’s worse: It doesn’t seem like they’re going to get any better.Thanks to the NBA’s orders, this is the only reasonable compromise for both the Pelicans and Davis. He gets to pervert his livelihood — surely important to a man who has spent so many days involuntarily sidelined by injuries — while the Pelicans at least get to lose some of the time.Here’s what it comes down to: The NBA can’t make a decision that weighs the Pelicans real interests, because it can’t be so blithely rational about what’s best for them, which is tanking. In an alternate universe with no draft lottery, the Pelicans might at least be incentivized to let Davis play when it matters to get fans in seats. But the league won’t acknowledge its worst kept secret, so a dysfunctional situation is primed to only get worse.Nothing like the 76ers to get the Boston Celtics going. And nothing like a loss to the Celtics on Tuesday night to spread anxiety in the lives of 76ers fans.Despite the addition of Tobias Harris, the 76ers lost to the Kyrie-less Celtics in the same ways they’ve habitually lost to them: The Celtics stuck like glue to the few shooters the 76ers play at the same time and treated Ben Simmons like a non-entity, while Al Horford ate Joel Embiid’s lunch. The Sixers couldn’t protect the perimeter on the other end, so they never got much of a chance to get out in transition.I won’t write them off as quickly as I did after Christmas, if only because Harris is the type of sharpshooter who could tip the scales in favor of an old-school style — if they’re willing to embrace it.Since trading for Jimmy Butler in November, the Sixers are seventh in pace, 11th in defense and 16th in offensive rebounding. This is a team with three starters who are above 6-foot-8, including the league’s most imposing center since Shaq, but it’s stuck in the middle because it’s trying to fit old-school parts into a new-school game. The league has been crashing full-tilt into more space and pace for years, so you can forgive the Sixers for trying, but you don’t win championships by playing against your strengths.Philadelphia should be slow, plodding, muscly and mean. It should crash the glass with impunity, hunt cross-matches with pick-and-rolls and bully defenders in the post. The mere idea of entering the paint against the 76ers should make opponents cower with fear.The only rub is that slowing it down doesn’t serve Ben Simmons’ style, but they’re going to have to figure out the inevitable tension between his transition-happy game and Embiid’s half-court dominance eventually. Better to do it while playing to your strengths and find out if it works now, instead of two years down the road.Following Jeremy Lin’s first game as a Raptor, he took to the podium and shared some interesting thoughts on the presence of the international media. Here are some snippets, from the Toronto Star:“Yeah, [Mandarin media] probably happens in every city that has a strong Asian contingent,” Lin said. “Happened in Atlanta as well, but not this. So again, I’m very proud to represent Asian people on a global platform, on a global scale. And for me to be here where there’s a lot of Asians, like, I used to run from it, you know?“Because that’s all anybody’s ever wanted to look for. Like, ‘Oh, he’s Asian, he’s Asian, he’s Asian.’ And I was like, talk about my basketball. But now people can see I can play, I belong in the NBA, and I’ve really embraced just being able to represent Asians and do it the right way, hopefully.“Yeah, I mean, I think I was really jaded after the New York stretch,” Lin continued. “I think there was a lot of things that happened that made me give up a little bit on people, per se. And that was a huge part of the story, and that was a huge point of contention for a lot of people as to why I was getting the publicity, or why things were the way they were.“So I kind of wanted to run from that a little bit. I would probably say three years down the road, I kind of turned a corner, and I would say being hurt for two straight years, and seeing that my Asian fan base, I don’t feel like it dropped off one bit. And I haven’t even touched the court. Like, every year I go over to Asia and I can’t even walk through the airport — it’s insane. So to see them do that after all the highs and lows, but really going through the lows post-Linsanity, which culminated in those injuries, for me, I’m still blown away. And again, that’s fed into why I want to carry myself a certain way.”I don’t have a lot to say here, except that it’s touching to see a man whose identity was leveraged and controlled by outside forces for so long get to stop running away from how he’s perceived and finally be himself: an NBA player who once turned the basketball universe on its head, an Asian-American, a God-fearing Harvard grad. He has lived long enough in the public eye that the public has finally accepted what they originally thought were contradictory traits.

At least, maybe you do when you’re Keith Tkachuk, and you’ve raised two true hockey ragamuffins in Brady Tkachuk and Matthew Tkachuk. Chances are, Keith’s probably more preoccupied with getting his sons not to obnoxiously dangle their mouthpieces out of their mouths.(And, yeah, maybe to make sure Matthew doesn’t get hosed on his second contract.)Anyway, Keith was on hand to see – and chuckle at – Brady, the younger of the two NHL Tkachuk kids, getting into a fight with Jonathan Ericsson of the Detroit Red Wings. It’s probably fair to say that Ericsson got the better of Brady, but judge for yourself in the video above this post’s headline, via Sportsnet.Judging by Hockey Fights’ listings, the family fight counts are now unofficially:Brady: Three. He’s a rookie, so he’s clearly endearing himself to opponents already.Matthew: Seven through three seasons.Keith: 51 fights during 1,201 regular-season and 89 playoff contests.Considering the temperaments of the Tkachuk brothers and father, chances are we’ll see more scuffles for both Brady and Matthew before they hopefully enjoy retirement as much as Keith seems to be enjoying it. And then there can be aggravating, skilled Tkachuk grandsons.—James O’Brien is a writer for Pro Hockey Talk on NBC Sports.

      "Gareth Bale has landed himself in hot water after La Liga denounced the Real Madrid star for his celebration in the Madrid derby, which could carry a ban of four to 12 games.The Welsh forward scored as a substitute in the 3-1 victory over Atletico Madrid, bringing up his 100th goal for the club.And during the celebrations that followed, Bale \"lifted his right arm near his head in a clear sign of provocation towards the fans, then giving a gesture which could be seen as obscene and disdainful by folding his arm and striking it with his other hand.\"In a statement released by La Liga, Bale’s punishment will be decided by whether he incited the crowd or not.If Bale is guilty of “inciting opposition fans” to cause a hostile reaction, the punishment could carry four to 12 games, if there was no hostile reaction but intent, then it could be as little as one to three games.The gesture is referred to in Spain as ‘corte de mangas,’ with the moment not picked up in the referee’s match report.A committee will now decide whether the gesture merits a punishment.Bale also featured in Real’s Champions League victory over Ajax.Los Blancos take a 2-1 lead back to the Bernabeu for the second leg of the last 16 tie after Marco Asensio’s late winner.\n"
