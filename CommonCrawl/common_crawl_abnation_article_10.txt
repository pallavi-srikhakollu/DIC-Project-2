on paper  the ram have a distinct advantage at wide receiver in super bowl    los angeles ha two different wideouts who gained more than     yard through the air in    new england  by comparison  doesn t have a single receiver who had more than   on the season <BRK>but the patriot do have a not so secret weapon who can even the scale against the ram  explosive passing attack  the second most prolific wide receiver in nfl playoff history <BRK>julian edelman s big performance in the afc championship game pushed him one step closer to the top of nfl postseason rank in both reception and receiving yard   and more importantly  gave tom brady the first down he needed to overcome the chief and make it to his record ninth super bowl  <BRK>a seven catch    yard performance in kansa city mean edelman stand alone in second place on the list of all time playoff target with   catch  and in third place with     yard in   postseason game  here s how he stack up with some other notable player from the past two decade  <BRK>with that kinda sorta milestone hit  it s fair to ask  where doe edelman sit in the pantheon of playoff great <BRK>statistically  it s true  no one since the  er legend ha made a greater overall impact in the postseason than edelman  who ha put together the rough equivalent of a   catch      yard  five touchdown season against the best team the nfl ha to offer in   playoff game  if you exclude the first three season of his pro career   year when he still transitioning from mac quarterback to nfl wideout   those projection explode to   catch      yard  and four touchdown in a   game season <BRK>that s right  edelman s playoff stats from   to      game  would put him on pace to have one of the league s top   most productive regular season of all time <BRK>few player have been a bigger security blanket late in one possession game than the rangy patriot  he produced two different third and   first down in overtime of last sunday s afc championship game  his   receiving yard in the fourth quarter and ot helped new england erase a     deficit in the greatest super bowl ever played  two year before that  he had nine catch for   yard and what proved to be the game winning touchdown to freeze out the seahawks in another instant classic <BRK>when the patriot need a big catch  edelman ha stepped up to deliver it  and rice appreciates how much that mean for his team  here s what the hall of famer told the athletic s jeff howe in the run up to super bowl   <BRK> people talk about   well  he s not a fat and stuff   that wa the same knock on me  they were saying i didn t have that blazing speed  what edelman ha is a big heart  he want to compete  he want to be one of the best  he is going to make those difficult catch knowing that he s going to get hit  you can t ak for more in a receiver  just like everybody feed off tom brady  they also feed off edelman  <BRK>he s got rice on his side     and he s also thrown a many or more postseaon touchdown pases a kirk cousin  andy dalton  and teddy bridgewater <BRK>edelman ha been a perfectly fine and reliable target  but his spot atop the record book is more a function of his constant postseaon presence a a long tenured new england patriot  playing with brady ha given him an unfair advantage over anyone else on the list  particularly receiver like larry fitzgerald or anquan boldin or demaryius thoma   those receiver are effectively stripped from the conversation because they ve spent significant swath of their career catching pases from the matt leinarts and trevor siemians of the world <BRK>edelman ha never been a super bowl mvp  like lynn swann  jerry rice  or even deion branch  he s had four playoff game where he s recorded one catch or fewer  boil his number down into digestible per game chunk and he doesn t look so superlative <BRK>among the nfl s top   postseason target since    edelman rank fourth in catch per game  seventh in yard per game  and  st in touchdown per game  his     yard per catch doesn t crack the top   either <BRK>those per game number suggest two other worthy contender to the postseaon goat mantle  larry fitzgerald ha been just a good in the postseaon a he s been in the regular seaon  julio jones  who averaged     more reception in the playoff and upped his catch rate from     percent to     percent despite being opposing defense  top target  ha been even better <BRK>how could you ever    <BRK>forget    <BRK>this    <BRK>catch   <BRK>the defense rest <BRK>edelman s edge in playoff experience   after super bowl    he ll have   more postseason game on his resume than jones and nine more than fitzgerald   give him the nod here  even after he missed the entire   postseason  and his team s title game defeat to the eagle   the patriot wide receiver ha gotten better over time  and his team is undefeated in super bowl where he ha at least one catch  since    the pat are     in postseason game where he take the field   a span in which he s averaged eight catch and     yard per contest  on february    he ll have the chance to add to those statistic  <BRK>those are stunning number against elite competition  and while jones offer more a a wide receiver and ha been prolific in his eight playoff game  he s still got some catching up to do <BRK>
