when this generation of penguin hockey pass into memory and the key core of player who made it possible retire from the game  you can guarantee sidney crosby s no    and evgeni malkin s no    will be sent to the rafter of ppg paint arena  their number will join the no    of mario lemieux and the no    of michel briere to be retired by the penguin franchise   note  by the time       retire  jaromir jagr s no    could also be retired  <BRK>while crosby and malkin have been the headliner  they have enjoyed a pretty strong supporting cat throughout the year  guy like marc andre fleury  chris kunitz  and phil kessel have all played significant role in this decade plus run of success  a important a those player were in support of crosby and malkin  none may have been a important or impactful a defenseman kris letang <BRK>often a lightning rod for the fan bae  letang ha been the anchor of the penguin blue line for over a decade at this point and cemented himself a a franchise legend  none of the success the penguin have achieved during this run would have been possible without letang  it is time to seriously consider sending his no    to the rafter following his retirement from the game of hockey <BRK>from a statistical standpoint  letang will go down a the most prolific defenseman in team history   at leat from an offensive perspective  letang hold the all time record for goal  asists  and total point by a defenseman in franchise history  he ha also played more game for the penguin than any defenseman to ever don the black and gold <BRK>those number will only continue to grow  a letang ha three plus seaons remaining on his current contract  by the time he play his final game in pittsburgh  letang may very well set the bar at a near unreachable level for anyone who come after him <BRK>of course it s about much more than just the individual number when discussing letang s legacy  a three time stanley cup champion  letang played a vital role in the   and   cup team before being sidelined by a neck injury that prevented him from being on the ice for   run  many use the   cup a evidence the penguin could win the whole thing without letang  but let s be honest  that duct tape blue line barely held it together and the possession number are there to prove it  even without being on the ice in    letang wa a major factor in helping his teammate off the ice any way he could <BRK>going back to the   and   stanley cup team  letang wa a major reason why the penguin raised the cup both of those season  in    letang posted   point in   game  including this ever important goal in game   against the wahington capital <BRK>that wa quite literally a season saving goal for the penguin to win game   and bring the series to      if they lose that game  they fall in a     and likely miss out on the stanley cup that season <BRK>fast forward to    and letang put up perhaps the best postseason performance of his career to help lead the penguin back to the stanley cup  his   point  along with his absurd     of average time on ice a night  led all penguin  defenseman  he wa simply a warrior for the penguin  turn out he also scored a pretty big goal in game   the stanley cup final against the san jose shark <BRK>everything leading up to that goal wa vintage letang  it wa only fitting he wa the one who finished the deal a well <BRK>everyone know what happened the following year  a the pen repeated a champion  letang missed the second half of the seaon and the entire playoff following neck surgery  his name wa still engraved on the stanley cup alongside his teammate  and even though he could not be on the ice  his work off the ice during the run is well documented <BRK>to further his cae a a playoff performer  letang lead all statistical category for defenseman in penguin history  game played  goal  asists  and point all belong to no     just like the regular seaon stats  oh yeah  he also ha the three stanley cup  another record for penguin  defensemen <BRK>all in all  here is a quick overview of letang s career accomplishment a a penguin  all of which he ha plenty of time to add to <BRK>making his nhl debut in    it wa clear letang had the talent necessary to be a top pairing defenseman in the future  only a year later  he wa recalled to the penguin on a full time basis and became the anchor on the blue line for the next decade  though he ha been plagued by inconsistency at time  he ha proven an invaluable asset to the penguin franchise <BRK>when letang wa faced with the prospect of being traded  he promised management he would work to improve his game and he delivered in every way possible  after suffering two potentially career derailing injury  stroke in    neck injury in     he rebounded and returned better than ever  nothing could ever keep kris letang down for long  and the penguin were always better off for it <BRK>at some point in the not so distant future  we will be faced with the reality that the player who made this era of penguin  hockey possible will no longer be taking the ice  father time always win  and it will eventually come for kris letang a well  <BRK>when the time come for letang to hang up his skate  his impact on the penguin  franchise will never be forgotten  and he should be properly honored for his accomplishment with his no    hanging from the rafter of ppg paint arena <BRK><BRK><BRK>
