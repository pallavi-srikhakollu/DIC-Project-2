head coach  jason candle       fourth year <BRK>  record and s p  ranking        th <BRK>projected   record and s p  ranking        th <BRK>five key point <BRK>i write about hard job a lot in my annual mac preview  toledo is not one of them  <BRK>the rocket tend to recruit better than their conference peer  and while many mac school struggle to come anywhere close to the fbs minimum of     in attendance per game  toledo is regularly over     <BRK>of the last   head coach the program ha hired  nine have produced at least one top   performance  per s p   jason candle  now entering his fourth season  ha enjoyed an average ranking of      his   team had maybe the best offense in school history  and his   team won toledo s first conference title in   season <BRK>that doesn t mean the rocket are invulnerable  far from it  they did  after all  go   year between conference title  and in    they found themselves struggling through the same post title attrition a most mac champ <BRK>toledo headed into   replacing star quarterback logan woodside  now a san antonio commander   running back terry swanson  three strong offensive linemen  and nearly it entire starting front six on defense  the receiving corp and secondary returned nearly intact  but for all the three star recruit toledo ha signed through the year  the rocket didn t actually start all that many last fall <BRK>they had hit a brief recruiting funk around the transition from matt campbell to candle  their only class in the last decade to rank worse than second in the mac wa signed in   and wa coming of age in    that seemed to bring them trouble  especially on a defense that started only three former three star and a bunch of two star and unrated recruit <BRK>the offense hit a midseaon dip a quarterback mitchell guadagni dealt with a couple of injury and replacement eli peter started slowly  but after averaging a def  s p  ranking of     over the previous three seaons  the rocket plummeted to  nd  they were sketchy against the pas   rd in pasing s p   and miserable against the run   th in rushing s p    they rushed the paser pretty well  but they never got to <BRK>toledo allowed at least     yard per play in eight of   game and at least   point in seven  anytime the offense didn t have it a game  the rocket were in trouble   they allowed     point per game in six loss <BRK>for only the second time in nine season  toledo won fewer than eight game in a year  granted  a     campaign would be cause for celebration in a good portion of this conference  but even for an anticipated reset year  the down moment were awfully down <BRK>  brings it own set of issue  the rocket return two quarterback with starting experience and a potential breakout in sophomore running back bryant koback  but the receiving corp ha to replace last year s top three  and a defense that wasn t disruptive enough to begin with now must replace five of last year s top six havoc producer  tackle for loss  pass defensed  forced fumble  and is dealing with a lack of size up front  even by mac standard <BRK>it s hard to worry too much about the secondary  which seems to have a nice mix of veteran production and high upside youth  but the front six could be heavy on sophomore  and between a potential quarterback controversy and new blood in the receiving corp  one could imagine more inconsistency <BRK>

  <BRK>any time you re juggling qbs  you re asking for inconsistency  but it seemed like opponent had to key first on the run game   if they couldn t stop koback  nothing else mattered <BRK>it wa eay to asume that it wa shakif seymour s turn a a feature back   the then sophomore had averaged six yard per carry a swanson s backup in     but koback  a former kentucky signee  had overtaken him in the starting lineup by mid year  and when he did well  toledo won <BRK>toledo ha long had a spread reputation on offense  but coordinator brian wright ha proved that if you can t stop the run  he ll keep running  the rocket ranked  th in rushing s p  and gained at least four yard on   percent of their carry  fourth in fbs   and they pulled that off with a freshman running back and a shuffled line   only two linemen started all   game  with up to four senior starter up front  and both koback and seymour scheduled to return  plus the latest potential star freshman  mid three star micah kelly   i m guessing the rocket will again have the best run game in the conference  or close to it <BRK>what happens when they have to pas <BRK>guadagni began like a house afire  in his first three game  against varying defensive quality  miami  nevada  vmi   he produced a gaudy     passer rating with a   percent passer rating and nine tds to one interception  but he suffered a head injury against fresno state  returned  then wa lost for the season with a broken collarbone  in between  he completed just   percent of his pass with a   passer rating <BRK>guadagni is an adventurer  he wa far more likely to go deep than his replacement  eli peter  far more likely to take off and run  he averaged     yard over about     non sack carry per game   and far more likely to take a sack  you could say he s far more likely to get hurt  too <BRK>peter wa better at intermediate pasing and ended up on his back le often  but even including the sack  guadagni finished at     yard per pas attempt to peter       i m guessing that give guadagni the edge at the outset <BRK>be it guadagni or peter behind center  their receiving corp will take on a new look     sort of  last year s top three   diontae johnson  an early draft declaration   cody thompson  and jon vea johnson   combined for   catch      yard  and   touchdown and all departed <BRK>there are still plenty of potential veteran in the rotation  slot man danzel mckinley lewis is a dynamite return man and averaged     yard per catch in   before missing most of last season  and desmond phillips is an extension of the run game type of slot receiver  high catch rate  low yard per catch   plus  seymour ha   catch out of the backfield in two season  and the tight end position ha experience  even if it used primarily in the run game <BRK>out wide  however  there will be youngster  junior bryce mitchell   an all or nothing threat if ever one existed  in two year  he s averaged     yard per catch with a positively dreadful   percent catch rate    might be the only upperclassman in the rotation  there are ton of former three star prospect here  from     sophomore nick kovacs to     redshirt freshman jalin cooper to any of five incoming freshman  but at the x and z receiver position  there is almost no experience whatsoever  if toledo can t punish opponent for loading the box to stop the run  that will be a problem <BRK>a daily ish mini column on the college football thing of the day  with some other stuff too <BRK>even with a green receiving corp  it s hard to worry too much about a toledo offense that ha ranked in the off  s p  top   in nine of the last   season  if the rocket are to fall short of a division title this year  the defense is an infinitely more likely culprit <BRK>the toledo defense wa not without it strength in    the rocket were  st in sack rate on passing down   th on blitz down  and ninth in defensive line havoc rate  after losing a dynamic trio of play making   linemen  led by   tfl olasunkanmi adeniyi   coordinator brian george generated similar disruption up front   the trio of end tuzar skipper and jamal hines and tackle reggie howard combined for     tfls and     sack <BRK>skipper and howard are gone  however  and toledo ha a double dip of turnover up front  those two weren t big  and toledo s front got pushed around quite a bit  for all their disruptive strength  the rocket gave up at least four yard on   percent of opponent carry   th  and ranked  th in rushing marginal explosiveness  they prevented neither efficiency nor explosiveness on the ground  <BRK>and while hines is a potential star in pas rush situation  he wa listed at only        pound last year  another potentially disruptive sophomore end   terrance taylor  who had     tfls among his   tackle   wa listed at        <BRK>and now the defensive line is even smaller  it doesn t have richard olekanma cleaning up mess at linebacker either <BRK>there is a potentially thrilling corp of sophomore in wright s front six  from hines and taylor to meatier tackle devonte  dunn and derrius mullins  to linebacker daniel bolden and dyontae johnson  to safety saeed holt and zachary ford  to corner deamonte king  desmond bernard  and incoming troy simon  but until toledo can figure out how to avoid getting pushed around  play making talent will only matter so much <BRK>at least the secondary should be in pretty good shape  between senior safety kahlil robinson and dedarallo blue  junior tycen anderson and justin clark  and a giant load of sophomore and exciting redshirt freshman  george should be able to find a nice rotation  i d be surprising if the pasing game didn t improve  but opponent didn t need to pas last year  and they might not have to this year either <BRK>the defense wa toledo s worst in five year  but the special team unit wa it best in six  the rocket were  th in special team s p  and ranked  th or better in each category  losing place kicker jameson vest   th in fg efficiency  might hurt  and losing return man diontae johnson  top   in both kick and punt return efficiency  definitely will  but danzel mckinley lewis  return from injury should alleviate the latter issue  punter bailey flint   th in punt efficiency  is solid  too <BRK>in last year s toledo preview  i wrote   a loss at niu could mean the division title go back to dekalb  but this is going to be an athletic team again this year  probably the mac s safest bet   that s how thing played out   their     loss in dekalb made the difference in the standing   but the rocket were projected to win     game and came up     short  the defense wa supposed to regress and did so more than expected  enough to offset the fact that toledo actually improved in off  s p  despite turnover and qb injury <BRK>between turnover in the receiving corp and an alarming lack of experienced girth on the defensive front  i m not a high on   toledo a i expected to be in    and neither is s p    despite dominant recruiting  the rocket are projected a the third best team in the west division <BRK>the schedule help immensely  though  of the top five projected non toledo team in the conference  three visit the glas bowl  wmu  niu  emu   and two aren t on the schedule at all  ohio  miami   the toughest projected mac road opponent is buffalo  and the rocket are therefore projected a at leat slight favorite in every conference game and in   game overall <BRK>there are enough tossup to prevent a run at double digit win  but the schedule is favorable enough to offset weakness  i can t declare toledo a the mac favorite  but the rocket will have play maker and a fighting chance <BRK>all   preview data to date <BRK>
