the most pressing concern for the celtic  at least in the short near term future  is the poor play of terry rozier and his impending restricted free agent status  i previously advocated for the celtic to keep rozier this season  with the thinking being that rozier raised the celtic ceiling the playoff  provided injury insurance  and  by extension  gave them an option in case irving left   <BRK> since then  irving very publicly indicated intent to resign with the team and we have reached a point where some  okay maybe most  are clamoring for brad wanamaker to get rozier s minute  i stand by my reasoning  but it s clear that with a full rotation  rozier hasn t contributed much to winning  and the only real reason for the celtic to keep him at this point is further injury insurance  rozier himself told yahoo  sport  vincent goodwill that the roster wa  too talented   a trade seems to be the most practical course of action for both side  <BRK> however  with espn s adrian wojnarowski reporting that the maverick are now trying to find a home for dennis smith jr   it seems unlikely that a rozier trade will materialize a healthy return for the celtic without including a pick  the historically deep pg market  rozier s regression this year  and availability of more tantalizing player under longer team control mean that the celtic don t have much leverage in any trade talk  <BRK> a team could eaily talk themselves into a starting rozier looking more like the player from lat year s playoff  but at this point in the seaon  perhaps only the magic have any real incentive to acquire him a a starting point guard this year  other team with starting ball handler need can simply let their tank seaon run it course and simply try to get rozier in restricted free agency with the knowledge that the tax paying celtic will likely not match any eight figure offer sheet  <BRK> simply put and barring extreme circumstance  rozier will likely not be a trade aset for the celtic between now and the deadline  and we are far more likely to see him a a sweetener or part of a large package  rather than the main piece in a swap  at this point  a high second round draft pick would be good return for him  but i m unsure if the celtic could even find a taker for a deal like that  it will be interesting to see if danny ainge make brad stevens play rotation musical chair for the rest of the year or bite the bullet on a poor return to find rozier a new home   <BRK> quick aside on rozier  this is why we should never demonize player player for taking the money when the chip are down  first of all  player getting paid is always extremely good  a team being held hostage by the salary cap is a direct result of small market team squawking that they can t compete and then signing omer asik for five year  if they want more money to get better player they can always relinquish more money to the player union for a cap jump   <BRK> the speed with which celtic fan have turned on rozier ha been pretty alarming  after he had such a large hand in what wa an extremely fun playoff  terry ha been bad  and at this point it seems like finding a trade that get him a bigger role and the celtic a better fit would be best for both side  i m not even saying it s necessarily wrong to hold player accountable with mean post or whatever we a fan do  but if you re someone who bemoans player not taking a hometown discount   well  this is why you don t do that  fan  goodwill come and go  bank account are forever ish   <BRK> in the interest of full disclosure i ll always have a soft spot for rozier and his high charisma  and hope that after he move on celtic fan remember the  i don t know who that is  terry rozier and not the     version of him  <BRK>  <BRK>
