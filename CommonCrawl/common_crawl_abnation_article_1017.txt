the   mlb season is here  so let s make some money on over under bet  the surest bet is that the entire league will finish with a    record  but since no sport book seem to offer that wager  let s delve into the individual team total to see where to capitalize  win total come courtesy of the westgate superbook <BRK>no better team to serve a the opener for these pick than the ray  the red sox and yankee are still the clas of the american league eat lat year  each reaching triple digit in victory  but tampa bay wa still able to scrounge out   win in    and that wa with a pitching staff that wa crushed by injury  but they still have pitching depth in spade  and should be competitive  pecota ha tampa bay at   win this year and steamer is at    which make this a perfectly placed over under  but with the return of brent honeywell and jose de leon in the next few month i think the ray will find a way to get at leat to that   win hump <BRK>the cub are still in the afterglow of vanquishing their century long championship drought  and still stocked with load of talent  they finished their   game schedule last year with   win  tied with milwaukee for the most in the national league  but a tiebreaker loss and a stunning wild card game defeat ended chicago s season before the real playoff even began <BRK>despite their   victory in the last four season top in baseball  the cub have a tough task in a division with the stacked brewer and the improving cardinal  chicago did little to improve this offseason  with a healthier yu darvish return their best chance at a positive jolt in    still  projection system are at odds on the cub  with steamer projecting them for   win  third most in the nl  and pecota going a step further with chicago at   win <BRK>that last projection ha chicago last in the nl central  which understandably didn t sit well with the cub <BRK>from this morning  someone on staff posted the recent pecota projection for the cub on the team s daily workout schedule on monday  i didn t do it   maddon said   you re always looking for the motivation   the bulletin board material   pic twitter com ih ffsgvty<BRK>while the cub probably aren t that bad  getting them to   win is a chore  so they are an under bet for me <BRK>there is no denying that baltimore is bad  and they are nestled at the bottom of the aforementioned top heavy al east  they lost   game last year  the highest total in   year  but the oriole can still be very bad and not lose   game  so mark me down for baltimore at     or something  and the over on     win <BRK>it is certainly possible that toronto could top   victory this year  with both pecota     and steamer     projecting them to do just that  but take the under for nothing else but karmic retribution for not having vladimir guerrero jr  on the opening day roster  <BRK>yes  a strained patellar tendon in his left knee technically took the decision out of toronto s hand  but it wa quite clear before baseball s top prospect got hurt that the blue jay planned to start guerrero in the minor in an effort to manipulate his service time  calling him up april   or after would make it impossible to accrue   day of service time  the minimum needed for one full year  that mean guerrero would be a free agent after   instead of   <BRK>the blue jay are hardly alone in this practice  the cub did the same with kris bryant in    and the brave with ronald acuna just last year  mlb s rule incentivize this practice  but it doesn t make it any le distasteful <BRK>sure  chicago missed out on free agent manny machado and bryce harper  but take them for the over here for the exact opposite reaon a toronto  eloy jimenez  one of the other top five or so prospect in baeball  will be on the white sox opening day roster  chicago signed the young outfielder to a six year     million contract on friday  plus club option for   and   <BRK>both steamer and pecota estimate chicago will win   game this year  but the al central is absolutely terrible outside of cleveland  any hint of competence is a boost in this putrid division <BRK>
