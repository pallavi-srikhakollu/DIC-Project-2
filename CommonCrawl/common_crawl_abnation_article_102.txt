   <BRK> the defense s collapse prevented a bowl bid  which prevented u from more clearly noticing jut how much the offense improved last year  the chant jumped from  th to  th in off  s p   combining solid run explosiveness   th in ruhing s p   with pas efficiency   th in pasing marginal efficiency despite a horrid sack rate   <BRK> they possessed a unique mix of efficiency and inefficiency  and three different qbs played between seven and nine game  but it worked for a while  coastal averaged     point per game during it     start and hung   on an excellent uab offense early in the season  <BRK> anderson dealt with an ankle injury for much of the seaon and eventually missed time  and then carpenter injured his knee a well  payton threw the ball well against the best of the sun belt late in the year  but the run game dried up a bit  and the struggling defense made sure that any drive failure put the game out of reach  <BRK> despite transfer  the competition level should be pretty high in each unit  <BRK> with chadwell taking on a higher role  he promoted quarterback coach willy korn  yes  the former clemson blue chipper  and running back coach newland isaac  an assistant at all three of chadwell s head coaching stop  to co coordinator role  <BRK> we ll see if the identity change at all  coatal ran the ball   percent of the time on standard down lat year   th highest in fbs  and   percent on pasing down   rd   which isn t surprising  a chadwell s always been a run heavy guy  but the chant didn t really spread opponent out   th in solo tackle forced  and operated at one of the slowest tempo in the country  when you ve got a defense struggling a mightily a coatal s did  playing at a slow pace is probably a good idea   it limit your exposure   but if the d improves  maybe the tempo go up in turn  <BRK> a daily ish mini column on the college football thing of the day  with some other stuff too  <BRK> marvin sander  first year in conway could have gone better  the former north carolina defensive coordinator  who got to know moglia back at nebraska  came to town with probably the best résumé on the staff  but he struggled to come up with answer for a defense hit pretty hard by attrition  <BRK> the front seven wa extremely young  and the experienced unit  the secondary  got wrecked by injury  eight defensive back made more than   tackle  but only one played in all   game  three freshman   corner derick bush and safety brayden matt and alex spillum   got extensive playing time  and that s usually not good  <BRK> the pas defense wa still better than the run defense  but neither were good  the chant rushed the paser pretty well when they had the rare opportunity to   th in sack rate   and they got better in the red zone  allowing     point per scoring opportunity   th in fbs  but in ranking  rd in pasing s p  and  th in rushing s p   their red zone defense certainly got plenty of practice  <BRK> end jeffrey gunter and his   tackle for loss are gone  but most of coastal s other havoc friendly player are back in the front seven  that includes junior tarron jackson    tfls and a team leading   run stuff   junior linebacker teddy gallagher and silas kelly  and tackle sterling johnson  <BRK> the size up front is solid  though jackson is very much the only known entity at end  <BRK> the good news for the secondary is that while five of the   leading tackler are gone  most of the right one return  matt and spillum were probably a good a any of the safety  and senior corner mallory claybourne  the steadiest of the corner  is back  depth is an obvious concern  but perhaps a couple of youngster can help solve that problem  a lot of ccu s more recent star recruit   redshirt freshman safety cincir evans  incoming freshman coleman reich and kj johnson ii   are db  <BRK> beyond that  the only other good news here is that the bar is low  <BRK> one assumes that with his experience under both bo pelini and john bunting  sander want to get aggressive if he can  but he had limited opportunity to do so  coastal should be able to rush the passer again in    but that will only matter if a  the chant can keep the right secondary on the field and b  they can figure out how to be a little le terrible in run defense  <BRK> the leg were asset for coastal in    freshman place kicker massimo biscardi ranked  rd in fg efficiency  and sophomore punter charles ouverson averaged     yard and ranked  th in punt efficiency  <BRK> granted  coverage wa an issue on both punt and  especially  kickoff  and ky jon tyler s return  though dangerous  were pretty inconsistent  still  coastal ranked  th in special team s p  and  with everyone back  should have a good opportunity to exceed that ranking this fall  this should be one of the best special team unit in the sun belt  <BRK> so now coastal attempt to settle in a bit  the chant  first two season at the fbs level have been full of transition  un transition  and re transition  and the product on the field ha been limited by injury and inexperience  <BRK> the offensive upside here is obvious  but defense remains the obvious question mark  coastal is projected  th in off  s p  but  th in def  s p   the make the chanticleers  th overall  but thanks to a schedule with eight opponent projected  th or worse  five of which have to visit ccu   a bowl run isn t completely out of reach  there are five likely loss  one likely win  and six game projected within a touchdown  if coastal can upset either emu or kansa early in the season  a     start isn t out of the question  <BRK> more likely  though  is that this simply becomes the year in which coastal attains some level of stability and begin building in earnest  chadwell s got a lot of sophomore around which to build  but that might not result in any major breakthrough for another year or two  <BRK> moglia s back story and building job were fascinating  but now it s on chadwell to start pushing the boulder forward  <BRK> all   preview data to date  <BRK>
