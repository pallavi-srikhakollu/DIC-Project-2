it s time for fan to rejoice  a the decision ha officially been made to fire scott linehan after yet another disappointing year from the offense in dalla  while team that have hired new head coach in the lat week have gotten a jump on filling out the rest of their staff  there are still some offensive coordinator candidate out there who could be a fit for america s team  earlier in the week i gave some potential candidate from the four remaining playoff team  but there are other candidate available now  here are seven of them <BRK>doug nussmeier<BRK>doug nussmeier just finished his first season with the cowboy coaching the tight end  and he deserves some credit for the way that position group developed towards the end of the year  most notably with blake jarwin and dalton schultz  it wa nussmeier s first time ever coaching tight end  but he ha a connection to scott linehan   he played quarterback when linehan wa the offensive coordinator at the university of idaho  <BRK>that familiarity with linehan might make nussmeier a good hire for continuity s sake  but nussmeier also ha playcalling experience of his own  he won a national championship in two year running the offense for alabama  working closely with jason garrett s close friend and mentor nick saban  and he also had stint with michigan and florida  if the cowboy believe they have the right offensive system in place but just want a new playcaller  nussmeier could be the frontrunner  however  if dallas want a clean break from linehan  nussmeier s longtime relationship with the now former offensive coordinator could deter any promotion <BRK>gary brown<BRK>it s a puzzling trend in the nfl that so few offensive coordinator were once running back coach  yet two of the hottest offensive coordinator this year  freddie kitchen and eric bieniemy  were running back coach before getting the coordinator job  kitchen did so well he s been named the new head coach of the brown  and bieniemy had several head coaching interview a well  <BRK>gary brown ha been coaching the running back in dallas for six season now with great success  he is largely credited with helping demarco murray make the jump to an elite running back before coaching darren mcfadden to his first     yard rushing season in five year back in the   season  brown ha also been instrumental in developing ezekiel elliott  and his relationship with the player is extremely positive  promoting brown would be good for continuity and his emphais on running the ball would go along with the team s philosophy  but it also leaf the door open for some ingenuity from brown  who spent two year under pat shurmur in cleveland  <BRK>sanjay lal<BRK>there wa a lot of excitement in the offseaon when sanjay lal wa hired a the wide receiver coach  his reputation a a mater teacher of route running skill wa supposed to help the cowboy create a successful pasing offense without dez bryant  it didn t necessarily work out  and the cowboy traded for amari cooper  who quickly cemented himself a the next great receiver for dalla  <BRK>while cooper came to the cowboy with a star pedigree already  he had been underperforming in oakland for a little over a year  a lot of this had to do with the way oakland wa using him  so prop need to be given to lal for connecting with cooper and getting him back to the kind of play he s accustomed to  however  lal deserves specific credit for the development of rookie michael gallup  who seemingly got better each and every week  in fact  gallup had the best game of his young career in the playoff loss to the ram  catching six pass for   yard  lal may be too new to the team for jason garrett to hand him the key to this offense  but the work this coach ha already done speaks for itself <BRK>david culley<BRK>you may be aking who this is  but after looking at his pat  david culley is an under the radar guy who ha incredible potential a a playcaller  he spent three seaons coaching wide receiver under bill cowher in pittsburgh before joining andy reid s first staff with the eagle  from   to    culley coached receiver for reid s high flying offense before he wa given the additional title of senior offensive asistant  when reid became the chief head coach in    culley joined him a the asistant head coach and receiver coach  <BRK>but culley had dream of becoming an offensive coordinator  and with reid calling play in kansa city  he had to go elsewhere to move up  for the   season  culley coached quarterback for the buffalo bill and led tyrod taylor to a career year en route to the bill snapping the longest active playoff drought in sport  and while the bill were a bit of a dumpster fire in    culley deserves credit for handling what wa hand down the worst quarterback situation in the league   they had four different starter  including nathan peterman and rookie josh allen   and coming out of it with the  th ranked offense  culley ha   year of experience with reid s offensive system  which ha been nothing short of spectacularly innovative all year  and he is clearly adept at working closely with both receiver and quarterback  he may not be the sexy hire  but on paper he might just be the best hire <BRK>marty mornhinweg<BRK>for some continuity  here s another former andy reid asistant in marty mornhinweg  from   to    mornhinweg wa the senior offensive asistant and asistant head coach in philadelphia before being promoted to offensive coordinator  a role he held from   to   when reid wa fired  while reid called the play  mornhinweg wa hailed for his heavy involvement in the offense and how much he helped the unit to improve  prior to coming to philly  mornhinweg spent four year a the offensive coordinator for the  er under steve mariucci before an unsuccessful two year stint a the lion head coach  <BRK>yet  in mornhinweg s entire career a both a head coach and coordinator  he s had eight different top   scoring offense  nine top   pasing offense  and six top   rushing offense  and in    mornhinweg wa running the offense for the raven and adjusted the team s scheme midway through the year to incorporate rookie lamar jackson s mobility  baltimore ultimately decided to move on from him after the team s loss in the wild card round this year  but mornhinweg s recent experience with a dual threat quarterback and his history in reid s offensive scheme could offer an exciting opportunity in dalla  <BRK>todd haley<BRK>yes  he wa fired by the brown alongside hue jackson  but that wa reportedly due to the very obvious rift between todd haley and the head coach and had little to do with haley s actual ability a a coach  in that regard  haley is a really great offensive coordinator  he started out a a disciple of bill parcells  which includes three seaons a the wide receiver coach and pasing game coordinator in dalla when the big tuna wa the head coach  <BRK>haley ha used the lesson he learned from parcells everywhere he s gone  he ha no real offensive scheme  but instead focus on highlighting each player s strength and aggressively attacking a defense s weakness  he crafted a deadly vertical passing attack that nearly won a super bowl for the cardinal  and then went to pittsburgh and got some of the best year out of ben roethlisberger and antonio brown while turning le veon bell into a star  much like parcells  though  haley can be a bit rough around the edge and that sometimes rub his player the wrong way  he wa reportedly let go by pittsburgh after the   season because big ben had grown tired of his shtick  his personality may end up clashing too much with garrett s culture  but if they decide he s a fit  then the sky is the limit for what haley could do with this roster <BRK>hue jackson<BRK>okay  stop laughing  yes  hue jackson wa a laughably terrible head coach a he went       in two and a half year in cleveland  but it can t be forgotten that jackson ha been pretty great a an offensive coordinator  he ran the offense for the raider in   and produced the sixth best scoring offense and second best rushing attack  <BRK>he wa also the bengal offensive coordinator from   to    during which time the bengal averaged     point per game and went       in the regular seaon  in both of jackson s year a the offensive coordinator  the bengal were top   in total yard  pasing  and rushing  including having the sixth best rush attack in    his success a an offensive coordinator is why jackson wa the hottest head coaching candidate after the   seaon  it obviously didn t work out  but jackson s ability to run an offense is very valuable  however  his ugly divorce from the brown may deter the cowboy from hiring him <BRK>
