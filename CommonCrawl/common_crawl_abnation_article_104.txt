antonio brown and the steelers have had their fair share of relationship issue  especially since the end of the regular season  brown hasn t been in contact with the team at all this offseason  but that s finally going to change  steelers owner art rooney is set to meet with the disgruntled receiver in florida  according to nfl network s ian rapoport   <BRK> that make sense  because the best thing for both side is to make up and move on together for the   season  <BRK> even with the meeting with rooney  that still seems like a long shot  most recently  brown dropped a social medium bomb when he announced that it s  time to move on and forward  after thanking steelers fan for nine year of support    <BRK> so while it appears more likely than ever that the steelers and the four time all pro wide receiver are headed for a divorce  that han t actually happened yet  the steelers haven t released or traded brown   but he ha put in a trade request   <BRK> antonio brown ha not been traded nor ha he been released  but brown want a trade and he officially ha requested that from the steelers  per source  <BRK> although brown and the steelers might both feel like it s time for a breakup  there s still one big issue looming over a potential deal  brown s contract   <BRK> whether the steelers trade or releae brown  they re not going to see much cap relief  brown ha a cap hit of        for the   seaon according to spotrac   that s not exactly a small amount of money that s eay to shed  brown also ha a      million roster bonus that get paid on march    that will factor into the timing of the move a well  his dead cap figure will be impacted by that roster bonus  <BRK> there are a few way the steelers can move on from brown  but all of the scenario would yield small return  <BRK> here s what they can do  and the resulting cap saving for each move  <BRK> pre june   release  before march     dead cap         cap saving          <BRK> pre june   release  after march     dead cap          the normal        dead cap figure plus roster bonus   cap saving          <BRK> pre june   trade  before march     dead cap         cap saving          <BRK> pre june   trade  after march     dead cap         cap saving          <BRK> post june   release trade    dead cap         cap saving          dead cap         <BRK> so  the steelers  option are limited here  a release is pretty much out of the question  spotrac currently ha the steelers with      million in cap space  unless the steelers are so done with brown they need him gone now  a little over    million in cap saving isn t worth letting a superstar talent walk out the door  <BRK> they could designate brown a a post june   releae to split up his dead cap hit over two seaons  but they wouldn t have access to the cap saving until june    they wouldn t be able to use the freed up cap space to sign free agent in march  which is when most of the high impact player get signed  <BRK> their only real choice would be to trade brown  trading brown before march   would only net that same    million in cap space  but at least they would get some draft pick in return  if the steelers wait until after june   to trade brown  they could send him to a team that missed out on a receiver in the   draft and wouldn t mind parting with pick in     <BRK> probably not what the steelers would ideally want  brown will turn   before the seaon  and it s unlikely that a team would trade multiple first round pick for his service   maybe not even a first rounder  to be fair to the steelers  they should want a boatload of premium pick for a player a good a brown   <BRK> ed bouchette of the pittsburgh post gazette said an nfl personnel man told him that he would only trade a day   pick for brown   a conditional fourth  or fifth round pick  jeremy fowler of espn spoke to two high ranking nfl executive who said they would trade a day   pick   one of them said that might fall to a fourth round pick if they find out more negative thing about brown in the trade process   <BRK> a pick on the third day of the draft  for antonio brown  hard pas   <BRK> people who would like to see brown get traded could point to    when the new england patriot traded a fourth round pick to the oakland raider for first ballot hall of famer randy moss  at the time  moss wa coming off his worst season in the nfl   he had   receiving yard and just three touchdown in   game  moss wa the perfect  buy low  candidate for the patriot   <BRK> brown isn t really a  buy low  candidate  sure  his receiving yard dipped this season with     yard  but he led the league with   receiving touchdown  he s still playing phenomenal football  even with the emergence of juju smith schuster  who led the steelers with     receiving yard in     <BRK> brown s value is an issue for both the steelers and the team trading for him  it s hard to invest heavily in a player in his  s  and it s hard to let a player of brown s caliber go without receiving quality compensation for him  both of those statement can be true  <BRK> for what it s worth  bovada still list the steeler a the team brown will most likely play for next seaon  with the  er right behind them  <BRK> it s been a stressful couple month for the steeler and brown  brown missed the last game of the season against the cincinnati bengal after skipping meeting due to a tense relationship with ben roethlisberger  brown reportedly threw a football at roethlisberger before storming off the practice field in the week leading up to their season finale  he ha not responded to message from the team and ha openly flirted with the  er  <BRK> brown is also dealing with an alleged domestic dispute  though his agent is denying the report that said dispute happened  on top of that  brown wa found guilty for reckless driving  <BRK> even with these issue  a few of his steelers teammate have said publicly they re hoping brown is in pittsburgh in    smith schuster said that he want brown back so they can try to win the super bowl  maurkice pouncey belief that  good phone conversation or sit down  could fix thing with how close the steelers are a a group  cam heyward would also like brown to return to the team  but understands that serious discussion need to take place before he can be welcomed back   <BRK> brown is second in team history in receiving yard and hasn t really slowed down at all   he s still incredibly valuable for this team in the immediate future  even with a young pro bowl receiver like smith schuster on the roster  taking away brown would hurt the steelers passing game  saint receiver michael thomas put it best   <BRK> if  ab  really leaving man pittsburgh about to be funny looking next year    the truth always come to the light pay attention  he opened up everything for the passing game and still got his  <BRK> brown ha cemented himself a one of the greatest receiver to ever step foot on an nfl field  the steelers are a better team with him  even with some of his late seaon transgression  <BRK> no matter if they cut or trade him  the steelers likely won t receive adequate value in return  brown is under contract until    and that s a commitment that can still be honored  it s on both the steelers and brown to come together  make up  and try to avoid any drama in the future   <BRK>
