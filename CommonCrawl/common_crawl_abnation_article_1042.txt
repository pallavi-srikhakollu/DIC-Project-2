le veon bell turned   on monday  <BRK>the former michigan state running back wa drafted by the pittsburgh steelers with a second round pick in    and by the end of the   season he wa a first team all pro  by definition  he wa the best in the world at his job and got there at age   <BRK>five year later  bell still hasn t had a chance to shop those skill and get whatever the nfl s free agency market decides he s worth <BRK>part of that is because of the four year contract that he and every other player picked after the first round signed in    but he wa slated to become a free agent in   and never got there  thanks to the franchise tag <BRK>it s an antiquated tool that give nfl franchise the chance to rob their most elite player the opportunity to negotiate their worth  and it s time for the franchise tag to get thrown out <BRK>in early    john elway wa nine season into his career with the denver bronco  he had already led the team to three super bowl  but he hadn t won one yet  even though his statistic in   were terrible by today s standard     touchdown    interception  and     passing yard   elway helped the bronco to a     record and earned a spot in the pro bowl <BRK>the problem for denver wa that the team wa struggling to sign elway to a new contract before he d reach free agency  according to sport illustrated  bronco owner pat bowlen argued in league meeting that there should be a rule that would allow him to keep elway for another year at top dollar so he d have more time to negotiate a new deal <BRK>elway wa given just under      million for the   season   the  th highest salary in the nfl that season  it gave the bronco enough time to strike a four year     million deal with him in   that made elway the highest paid player in the league <BRK> the elway rule  evolved into the franchise tag  a full explanation of the franchise tag and it little brother  the transition tag  is right here  but the gist is this  nfl team can tag one impending free agent per offseason and guarantee that player can t leave for a year in exchange for a lofty  fully guaranteed salary that s among the top at their position <BRK>it sound pretty nice to get a one year  fully guaranteed salary at a high price  a player like bell isn t exactly hurting financially because of it  he received      million under the franchise tag in   and would ve made      million had he played instead of holding out in   <BRK>the open market is a different beast  though  <BRK>when team are competing for a player   especially one who s the best in the nfl at his position   that s when the price tag really spike <BRK>that s why kirk cousin received      million and      million under the franchise tag in   and    respectively  but a three year deal that averaged    million once he became a free agent  and that s for a quarterback who is above average  at best <BRK>bell should ve reached free agency in   a a fresh   year old  he would have had the chance to reset the market for running back with a record breaking contract for the position  he should ve had that opportunity again in   at age   after his second all pro seaon <BRK>the steelers even have the chance to deny him that chance again this offseason with the transition tag  although they ve said that won t happen and he ll become a free agent <BRK>meanwhile  bell s value continued to diminish a he got closer to age   and racked up a league leading amount of offensive touch <BRK>for his trouble  bell ha been labeled a selfish malcontent  but he s just doing what other star previously threatened to do <BRK>

  <BRK>eric berry told reporter in   that he wa prepared to sit out a season if he wa tagged again by the chief  and von miller made the same threat in   after winning super bowl mvp <BRK> no  i m not going to play on the franchise tag   miller told espn   i ve never really played for money  it s bigger than that for me  it s a league wide problem that i feel like i m in a situation to help out with  <BRK>it probably set off your  am i really that old   alarm to hear a rule invented in   called antiquated  but the economics of the nfl were much  much different then  an average starting quarterback made just over    million per year and the upper echelon player made about    million  <BRK>now the stake are way higher and team can prevent record setting bidding war  the franchise tag serf a a tool that keep player from setting the entire market higher <BRK>it worked out pretty well for cousin  though  he spent a couple season raising his price with consecutive tag and then hit the market for his huge deal  but cousin play a position with more longevity  le wear and tear  and a significantly higher average salary than bell s position <BRK>few player are a fortunate a cousin  with the franchise tag  most are often forced to jeopardize their chance at the biggest pay day of their career <BRK>there s really no equivalent to the franchise tag in the rest of the working world  the best doctor in the world isn t forced to stick it out at a hospital that owns the right to his service  the best professor in the world isn t stuck at a university  <BRK>professional sport are different for the sake of entertaining and equal competition  that s not just a franchise tag thing  the nfl draft doesn t have a real world equivalent  either  it force a player into multiple year under the employer that won the right to their service  and there s no realistic alternative for that player <BRK>there s an argument to be made for removing draft in sport  but the nfl s parity is a stronger argument that it shouldn t go anywhere  and it won t <BRK>there isn t anything like the franchise tag in other sport  though  the cleveland cavalier couldn t force lebron james to stay  and neither could the washington national with bryce harper <BRK>is there even a logical argument for franchise tag to stay at this point  if an elite player doesn t get a contract extension from the team that drafted them  that s the team s problem  it got four or five year of excellent play and it ll get a compensatory draft pick for that player s departure <BRK>are we really supposed to feel sorry for the steelers  valued at over      billion  mind you  for only getting four or five year of elite play from bell  because they chose to offer him a contract of funny money with little actual guarantee <BRK>the franchise tag is allowed under the current collective bargaining agreement between the nfl and nfl player association  but it expires after the   season  <BRK>there are a lot of thing for the two side to haggle about and a lengthy labor dispute is probably on the way in    it remains to be seen what the nflpa will make it top priority  but eliminating the franchise tag should be one  all it doe now is limit player from reaching their earning potential and subsequently raising the price for the rest of the nfl s talent pool too <BRK>
