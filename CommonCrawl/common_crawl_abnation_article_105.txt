the nfl conference championship weekend is upon u  the winner will then head to atlanta for the super bowl  everyone will have you covered with the matchup on the edge  but who s going to have you covered in the trench  guess what  i will  let s talk about these offensive line and the matchup i m looking at  <BRK> the four team playing these weekend have elite offense  this is the nfl in the   season  these offense can do it all  they score point at a high level and run efficient offense  both in the run and the pas   <BRK> and shocking to no one  when you have an excellent offense  your offensive line is elite  there s no way to have a great offense without having some ugli up front to move defender off the ball and protect the quarterback  here s how these offensive line stack up  per football outsider  <BRK> so yes  these offensive line can ball  and although the chief are middle of the pack for adjusted rushing  they are sixth in yard per rush   <BRK> let s look at some important matchup for the offensive line this weekend  <BRK> the first matchup is when the saint are on offense and the ram are on defense  the second is when the ram are on offense and the saint are defense  <BRK> andrus peat v  aaron donald <BRK> saint left guard andrus peat wa outstanding last season  i thought he played well this season but battled through injury  injury are still a concern for peat this weekend after it wa revealed he played last weekend with a busted hand  during the bye week  peat had surgery to fix a broken hand  he played with that surgically repaired hand against the eagle and it wa a rough go  peat wa called for four penalty   two holding and two false start   and had some issue in the run game  i can only imagine  our hand are our job and not being able to use one of them effectively can be detrimental to our play   <BRK> now peat is up against aaron donald  we know all about aaron donald  donald can straight up ruin a game  the saint must find way to get peat help any way possible  they can send max unger his direction in pas protection but in the run game  they can slow up donald but trying to cut him and get at his leg   <BRK> rob havenstein v  cam jordan  <BRK> sheldon rankin suffering a torn achilles this pat weekend is a huge loss for the saint  rankin helped their second ranked rushing defense and wa able to terrorize quarterback on the regular  if rankin were healthy  he d be the matchup to highlight  instead  we will highlight cam jordan against ram right tackle rob havenstein  havenstein wa the third best right tackle in the nfl this seaon and he can do everything well  he s going against jordan  who s routinely underrated a a player   <BRK> jordan ha an amazing ability to reach the edge against an offensive lineman with his jump chop move  he jump to the outside  knock down your hand  and pull himself through  he set it up with a strong bull rush early in the game  it get an offensive lineman leaning  havenstein will have to stay balanced in his set to avoid getting up pressure to jordan  i think he s up to the challenge   <BRK> let s start with the chief  pas rush against the new england offensive line and then the kansa city ol against the patriot  defensive pressure  <BRK> trent brown marcus cannon v  dee ford justin houston <BRK> the patriot have a fabulous offensive line  they are underrated  they ve kept tom brady upright  and it s hard for me to find a matchup to watch  they traded for trent brown this offseason and he s been rock solid at left tackle  marcus cannon ha been solid for year now  however  both these guy will need to play well this weekend at arrowhead  <BRK> dee ford had his best professional season    sack and   qb hit  then there s justin houston  who s been in the lineup full time since week    in that time  including the playoff game  houston ha seven sack and nine quarterback hit  if the patriot get behind early  they will need their tackle to hold if they want to throw it around the field   <BRK> chief offensive line v  new england s pressure package stunt twist game <BRK> the patriot front four doesn t strike fear because on the whole they don t rush the passer well one on one  however  the patriot are elite at generating pressure by bringing extra men and stunting up front  i m sure the patriot will have something dialed up the chief  i have no fear the chief will be ready for all of this  if they can block it up  patrick mahomes can make the patriot pay   <BRK>
