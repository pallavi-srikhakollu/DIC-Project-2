there will be no player more hotly debated leading up to the   nfl draft than quarterback kyler murray  the oklahoma heisman trophy winner is expected to pursue football  despite being a first round draft pick by the oakland athletics  <BRK>if murray stick with football  he could change the shape of the first round  without murray  there are more team in the top   that need a quarterback than there are good quarterback available  but with murray  that issue is mitigated  <BRK>the cardinal controversially hired kliff kingsbury  and people quickly proved themselves to be fool thinking he would trade josh rosen to take murray with the first overall pick  that s not going to happen  what should happen is taking bosa with the first pick  new defensive coordinator vance joseph will know how to unlock bosa s potential a a pas rusher and build his defense around the ohio state star <BRK>there are a number of free agent pas rusher the  er could pursue this offseason  including frank clark  jadeveon clowney  trey flower  dee ford and demarcus lawrence  san francisco s top priority should be acquiring one of those player  but if none hit the market  getting a player who can pressure the quarterback is the team s top draft need  <BRK>the jet could toy with the idea of adding a playmaker on defense  but getting williams is just the smarter move  the franchise is dependent on the development of quarterback sam darnold under new head coach adam gae  if darnold s development stall  it could doom not only he and gae  but also jet general manager mike maccagnan  an improved offensive line  with williams a the key piece  should help darnold reach his high potential <BRK>the raider should be happy if williams is still around with the no    pick  in   month  williams went from unknown at alabama to arguably the top player in the draft  following a season of   tackle      tackle for loss and eight sack  oakland need player who can create pressure on defense  and williams is a nice fit <BRK>yes  the buccaneer just took cornerback in the second round of the   draft  but do they really have a cornerback capable of covering mike thomas of the saint and julio jones of the falcon twice each per season  williams ha the size at     and the playmaking ability to match up with the nfl s best <BRK>at    it s time for eli manning to call it a career  or at least be the bridge quarterback for his successor in    the inclusion of murray actually help the giant  it could lighten quarterback trade market  leaving the giant to pick between haskins and murray <BRK>there is legitimate buzz around murray  and he could elevate into the top   if a couple thing happen  most obviously  he ha to commit to football over baseball  if that doesn t happen  his stock in the draft will drop dramatically  murray will also have to show team in meeting he ha a good understanding of the game after starting just a season in college  that might be more concerning than his size  which can be schemed around <BRK>the lion go into the offseason in need to finding at least one high end pas rusher  ferrell is arguably the best prospect on the talented clemson defensive line in this year s draft  he is experienced and sound technically  so he could help the lion straight away <BRK>although some would argue ole miss left tackle greg little over ford  the oklahoma blocker might be a better fit for buffalo  ford is more natural on the right side  which would allow the bill to keep   second round pick dion dawkins on the left side <BRK>bronco general manger john elway need to hit on a quarterback this offseason after striking out on a few in the draft and unwisely giving case keenum too much money last offseason  lock is a risk because he ha a long way to go in developing  but he ha the talent to finally break elway s bad streak <BRK>this just seems like one of those pick that will be locked in for much of the draft process the next few month   a linebacker is high on the list of need for cincinnati this offseason  and white is the type of player who can set the tone  <BRK>it s evident the packer need to use this pick on the player they consider to be the best pas rusher available  the way this mock play out  that is polite  the talented florida pas rusher who had   sack this season  want a quick comparison for polite  his gameplay reminds me of trey flower of the patriot <BRK>the dolphin are a sneaky winner of murray intending to play football  that mean jones should drop to them at no     there s even a chance lock could too  either way  the dolphin are in a better position for a first round quarterback if murray is in the draft  a pa rusher could be in play for miami at this spot a well <BRK>like the devin white to cincinnati pick  this one seems pretty locked in right now  it really is the perfect combination of need  fit and value  in oliver  the falcon would get one of the draft s more dynamic defensive linemen in draft  he s a powerful tackle who will displace blocker with ease and pursue the ball carrier <BRK>there are like seven position on wahington you could say is the team s biggest need in the offseaon  a claim could be made about a quarterback  pa rusher and safety  however  wahington ha arguably one of the worst wide receiver group in the nfl  brown  would immediately asume the spot a the team s lead wide out <BRK>alabama safety deionte thompson will be an intriguing option for carolina in the first round  but gary s potential is too great to pas up this late in the first round  gary is the complete package of size and athleticism for an end  he just never quite lived up to the hype at michigan <BRK>the brown are hiring former buccaneer offensive coordinator todd monken for the same role in cleveland  he s a pas game specialist  but the brown don t have a mike evans like receiver on the roster  metcalf can be that player  he s a big athlete for the position  and even had a josh gordon comparison <BRK>it s the standing take for the viking  draft the best offensive lineman available with the  th pick  more than anything  the viking need to acquire talent up front and then figure out how it all fit together  little is the type of talent at tackle that he would push brian o neill into being more of a utility lineman  <BRK>the titan lost brian orakpo to retirement  and need a good edge player opposite budding star harold landry  burn is a player who profile similarly to orakpo  he s a lengthy edge player with athleticism  burn doen t have the strength orakpo doe  but he can get there <BRK>the steelers would be overjoyed to see murphy still available with the no    pick  he s a natural playmaker on the ball  and is willing to come up and make a tackle against the run <BRK>the playoff loss by the seahawks showed they need to improve the interior of both the offensive and defensive line  from a value standpoint  that s much easier to do in this draft with a defensive lineman  simmons is a powerful interior player capable of pushing blocker aside to find the ball  his playing style is somewhat similar to fletcher cox of the eagle  <BRK>if the raven are going to fully devote to a heavy run offense with lamar jackson  the team ha to get better on the interior of the offensive line  risner should be able to handle left guard for the raven  and could even looked at a a center <BRK>this pick absolutely need to be a cornerback or offensive tackle  finding a blocker for deshaun watson should have a priority unless someone like murphy happens to slip to no     taylor is a powerful blocker who can drive defender backward with ease <BRK>adding williams and sweat up front with arden key would suddenly give the raider are dangerous group of player up front on defense  sweat is a player who is comfortable rushing from the edge either standing up or with his hand down <BRK>maybe this is too reactionary  but the sunday s playoff loss to the saint showed that the eagle need a true lead running back  don t forget that jay ajayi  who tore his acl this season  is a free agent  if there s a first round back in the   draft  it is jacob <BRK>a pa rusher and cornerback could be argued a bigger need for the colt  but team s interior defensive linemen still seem more suited for a     system  wilkins is a nice fit a an athletic interior defender who can work gap and get into the backfield <BRK>the raider need one  or maybe even two wide receiver in the draft this year  harry would be a nice pickup in the first round  he s obviously a talent at the position  otherwise he wouldn t be this high in the draft  but he s capable of playing in the slot and outside  which would give the raider flexibility later in the draft <BRK>at this point of the first round it would be hard to look past thompson  that s especially true for the charger if they continue to utilize seven defensive back at a time  thompson is a rangy coverage safety  but he showed at alabama last season he s capable of coming up against the run <BRK>allen will be a player who intrigue patriot head coach bill belichick  allen could be used a a true     end  but in nickel situation be pushed inside  allen would also give belichick some versatility with his roster  if trey flower aks for too much money in free agency  and the patriot want to use their franchise tag on someone else  a player like allen could help them move on <BRK>adderley is the best small school prospect in the   draft  and the type of player the ram could target if lamarcus joyner departs in free agency  adderley started four year at delaware  at both safety and cornerback  <BRK>after week of scrutiny for mocking fant s teammate t j  hockenson here  i ll relent for now  that s mostly because a of this writing on early monday morning hockenson ha yet to declare for the draft  fant is a nice option for the packer in cae hockenson doesn t go pro  he can be green bay s version of zach ertz <BRK>mullen is coming off an excellent national title game for clemson and could find himself in the first round of the draft  he s a lengthy cornerback who move smoothly around the field  if mullen test well at the nfl scouting combine next month  look for his stock to rise quickly <BRK><BRK>
