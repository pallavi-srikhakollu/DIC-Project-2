for about an hour on tuesday  espn s mel kiper dished on the   nfl draft on a teleconference with the medium  <BRK> some of the most interesting bit of the call were when kiper talked about oklahoma quarterback kyler murray  but that wasn t all  here s the best of what kiper discussed   <BRK> almost every year there s an athletic quarterback in the draft who is invariably forced into a different position by some analyst  most recently bill polian  then of espn  said lamar jackson is a wide receiver   <BRK> what then  of kyler murray  he s obviously a great athlete  who is giving up baeball for football  but despite being a relatively undersized      kiper said he  definitively  view murray a an nfl quarterback  <BRK>  his arm strength  his accuracy  his football iq   today s nfl suit him perfectly  he s a quarterback all the way   kiper said   now  is he the fourth pick of the draft to oakland  is he a guy who go   to cincinnati    to miami  doe he in fact go ahead of dwayne haskins  he could  he s a bit of a wild card   <BRK> kiper continued on about the murray v  hakins debate  two quarterback who are so dissimilar stylistically  while murray excels when he can throw outside the pocket  the ohio state quarterback is much better standing behind his line a a pocket paser   <BRK>  to compare him to dwayne haskins isn t fair  because they re totally different quarterback   kiper said   their style of play would change the way you go about your business if you bring him in  and haskins is a traditional  drop back pocket passer  while kyler can do everything  he can throw from the pocket but you want him outside the pocket   <BRK> after murray and hakins  the most likely quarterback to land in the first round of the draft is missouri s drew lock  although he had a rocky college career  lock did well for himself at the senior bowl and ha momentum leading into the nfl scouting combine next week   <BRK> inside the first   pick  the most likely team to take a quarterback are washington  pick no      miami  no     and the new york giant  no      the denver bronco with the  th pick were in contention for a quarterback  but that may not happen with the team trading for joe flacco  kiper think if the bronco trade down in the first round  they could still be in play for lock after being widely linked to him for much of the offseason  <BRK> still  kiper say there isn t much agreement from his nfl source on where lock will land  <BRK>  he could be there in the late first  early second round   kiper said   there s no built in consensus on where lock is going to go  he s got the big time arm  he had a really good finish to the year with the last seven game   <BRK> in his most recent mock draft  kiper had haskins going to the giant  murray to the dolphin  and lock to washington  sb nation had the same top three  but with lock getting drafting by the dolphin and murray heading to washington  <BRK> with a combination of jon gruden  new general manager mike mayock  and having three first round pick  kiper said the oakland raider the most intriguing team to watch this year in the draft  <BRK>  they have the three first round pick  they have a chance next year and the opportunity to fill a lot of hole   kiper said   they have decision to make   the antonio brown situation in pittsburgh and needing a receiving  they have the draft pick  do they try and make a move there   <BRK>  do they take kyler murray  do they move derek carr  do they stick with derek carr  jon ha always raved about quarterback like  patrick  mahomes and russell wilson and the like  so what s his opinion of kyler murray and contrasting him and comparing him to derek carr   <BRK> kiper continued  <BRK>  so  i think it s going to be  you talk about about a fascinating player  it s kyler murray  the most fascinating team in this draft for obvious reason is the oakland raider   <BRK> kiper said there were three  elite  player in the   nfl draft  for kiper  they are kentucky defensive end josh allen  ohio state defensive end nick bosa  and alabama defensive tackle quinnen williams  <BRK> of those three  kiper had the most to say about allen and where he could fall in the draft  specifically  he think allen is set for a top three pick and is close to bosa in term of his overall grade  the san francisco  er with the no    pick and the new york jet with the no    pick are both in play for allen   <BRK>  with his length and his size and his speed and the kind of kid he is  yeah  he s right there   kiper said of allen   i still give bosa the edge  but there s no question if you re looking for an edge rusher  whether the  er or the jet  if you trade out of there you re taking yourself out of the josh allen situation  i don t think the  er or the jet would want to do that   <BRK> during part of the call  kiper wa asked about mayock going from nfl network analyst to oakland raider general manager  and if he had ever been considered for an nfl front office job   <BRK> a it turn out  kiper could have become an nfl front office person in the  s with the baltimore colt  in    the colt drafted quarterback john elway  even though he vowed to sit out football if they didn t trade him  that  and an opportunity at espn  kept kiper out of the nfl at the time  <BRK>  i had that opportunity in   to work for the baltimore colt   kiper said   ernie acorsi wa going to bring me in and then it didn t work out obviously with ernie s situation with the john elway trade and the team moving  so i stayed doing what i wa doing  five month later  i decided to move on to espn   <BRK> it turned out pretty well for kiper  who is still at espn  but he also added that other nfl opportunity have popped up  <BRK>  there s been other possibility out there along the way that just weren t something i wa going to look into because i wa very happy doing what i wa doing and the situation at espn  so i m not going to give up all that to go to work in the national football league at that time   <BRK>
