before we dive into what come next  let s take a moment to remember a reality oft forgotten on the internet  life is complicated  understanding it requires nuance and an ability to hold multiple truth  for the sake of this particular exercise  we ll ask that you allow for the possibility of two specific reality  <BRK> the first is this  boston celtic  forward gordon hayward  a man who ha proven himself to be an exceptional baketball player  sustained an extremely gruesome injury lat year  expecting him to play at anything like the level he showcaed prior to his injury in the early stage of his return to the court wa never fair  the physical and mental healing that hayward need to complete to regain his standing a an all star caliber player are ongoing  <BRK> which brings u to our second truth  hayward ha been bad  he s averaging jut     point per game  on          shooting split  boston ha been     point per   possession worse in his minute on the court  per cleaning the glas  hayward is making progress  but he s still dearly lacking in explosiveness  and wildly inconsistent a a shooter  he han t even played well enough to claim a starting spot in the rotation  <BRK> that s not the ideal outcome for the celtic  who have a hair over    million committed to their recovering star over the course of this seaon and the following two  hayward  who signed with boston lat off seaon  wa meant to be the piece that pushed the celtic into the realm of legitimate contention   a swiss army knife of a wing  a capable of functioning a an offensive initiator  a spot up shooter  or a bully to smaller player in the mid post  <BRK> his appeal came in his versatility and consistency  hayward wa the perfect fit for boston s roster  a rising tide with essentially no hole in his game  his integration with a team overflowing with talent wa meant to be seamless  <BRK> but it hasn t been  and that s fine  remember our first point  <BRK>

   <BRK> hayward deserves a full calendar year  at leat  before we start adding judgement to our analysis  paul george ha suggested it took him a much time to feel entirely back to himself after sustaining an injury of similar intensity  it s worth noting that now  in his fourth year since returning to action  george is a fringe mvp candidate having the best seaon of his career  <BRK> there s no guarantee that hayward s recovery will play out in an identical fashion   the two are certainly different player   but george s career arc suggests that boston would be wise to remain patient  that make hayward s limited on court impact no le real in the present however  and here is where thing begin to get tricky  <BRK> the celtic have underperformed relative to expectation  the presumptive favorite to win the eatern conference  boston currently sits fifth in the standing  there are plenty of reaon why  the whole team got off to a slow shooting start  al horford ha been dealing with a knee injury that s left him noticeably slowed at time  terry rozier ha regressed in his reduced role a a reserve  neither of the jaylen brown jayson tatum duo ha taken quite a big a step forward a celtic  optimist had hoped  though they re both playing considerably better than early seaon narrative would have you believe   <BRK> but none of that is a important a hayward s struggle  there s simply no world in which all the preseaon hype and sixty win prediction could come true without hayward playing like an all star  boston isn t a contender without the best version of him  that doesn t mean the rest of the team is excused for their role in the celtic  record to date  <BRK> hayward isn t responsible for rozier s inability to function a a playmaker  or brown s lost three point stroke  or tatum s early seaon obsession with shooting contested mid ranger  those thing all impact boston s ceiling  but they don t really matter unless the team s trio of star   hayward  horford  and kyrie irving   are firing on something close to all cylinder  <BRK> one of them is very clearly not  so now what  that best option is likely just to wait thing out  hayward ha shown some sign of improvement  and boston is still outscoring opponent when he play  even if they ve been substantially worse than when he sits  it stand to reason that hayward will get closer to returning to his pre injury form the further he get from the moment he sustained it  <BRK> it s not incredibly far fetched to think that he may be a more consistently positive player by the time the playoff roll around  that would make the celtic a considerably more daunting postseason opponent  it would also make cleaning up all the other issue that have troubled them throughout the year a priority  <BRK> regardless of the final destination of the journey that is hayward s current campaign  boston and it supporter may want to buckle up  there are going to be more ups and down  more frustrating loss  such will be the cae a long a hayward is still recovering and rediscovering what made him so great  <BRK> it s not his fault  and he need not bear the weight of it  but it s a reality that need to be acknowledged and factored into expectation for the celtic moving forward  <BRK>
