  <BRK>offensive coordinator matt kubik s attack wa a good a advertised when it wa on schedule  the warhawks ranked eighth in standard down marginal efficiency  and evans raised his paser rating on first down from     in   to    his mistake were typically costly  though   his     percent int rate on first down wa about twice a high a you would prefer   and once behind schedule  the wheel came off <BRK>you would think that a pas first attack would be more suited for converting pasing down  but ulm ranked  th in pasing down marginal efficiency  on third and   or more  evans completed just   percent of his pases and averaged just   yard per completion  he took minimal chance and still rarely found his target <BRK>and that wa with marcus green  one of the sun belt s best receiver  he s the only departure among ulm s top four wideouts  but his   catch    yard  and eight touchdown all easily led the team <BRK>overall continuity is a important a losing one guy  though  and ulm s in good shape there <BRK>turner ha been an explosive complement for year and could be a nice go to  there s depth here  too  and maybe variety will help with some of those passing down conversion <BRK>kubik s attack is pas first  but having a relentlely efficient run game wa what made the warhawks so dangerous on standard down  though leading running back derrick gore is gone  the good news is that he wa le efficient than most of the other member of the backfield <BRK>evans pick his spot very well with his leg  and both senior austin vaughn    percent  and kayin white    percent  had better success rate than gore    percent   onetime ole miss commit josh johnson didn t do much after showing up in august  but he could be ready for more of a load with a full offseason in the program <BRK>and when i say the ulm line is experienced  i mean it is experienced  all five of last year s starter are back  including third team all conference performer bobby reynolds  center  and t j  fiailoa  right guard   the five have combined for   career start  one of the highest total you ll ever see heading into a season  and since ulm ranked  rd in stuff rate  run stop at or behind the line  and  th in sack rate  the bar is awfully high for this unit  if evans ha another gear  this line will give him time to reach it <BRK>a daily ish mini column on the college football thing of the day  with some other stuff too <BRK>technically  there wa nowhere to go but up for the ulm defense in    the warhawks    unit wa one of the worst you ll see   they ranked dead last in def  s p   allowing     adjusted point per game  their percentile rating of     percent wa the seventh worst of the decade  fourth among team not named eastern michigan   so saying that ulm improved in   is kind of a  well  duh  situation  it almost literally couldn t get worse <BRK>that said  the warhawks actually improved  all the way to     adjusted point per game and  th in def  s p   that s not good enough  obviously  but it wa a substantive advance  ulm built an identity around disruptive play    th in stuff rate   th in sack rate   and really seemed to find a groove in the second half of the season  once the sec opponent were done doing their damage <BRK>that last number is key  the percentile rating is adjusted for opponent  and it show that ulm didn t simply improve because a m and ole miss were off the schedule <BRK>more good news  just about everyone is back  well  at least theoretically  the two leading returning linemen  end kerry starks and tackle jaylen veasley  both did stupid thing this offseason  you can read more here  starks is suspended  veasley might be soon   we ll see if they end up on the field this fall <BRK>to be sure  starks and linebacker david griffith  who s definitely gone  were important  leading the team with five sack each  but tackle maon husmann and larance shaw and end donald louis jr   all of whom are back  were nearly a important a starks and vealey  and depth and diversity of play making wa one of the team s strength <BRK>ulm brings back every linebacker beyond griffith  plus every key lineman beyond maybe starks veasley  and five of last year s top seven db  and rhoy williams  a starting safety in    return after missing last season with injury  which will help to ease the loss of safety collin turner  so will the addition of three star juco transfer keilos swinney <BRK>so now we get to find out if further improvement is possible  really  it doesn t matter if ulm can stop fsu or iowa state   it only ha to disrupt offense like texas state s and coastal carolina s  it probably can <BRK>missing out on a bowl because of a missed field goal wa a little bit on the nose  ulm s special team unit dragged it down a lot in    the warhawks fell from  th to  th in special team s p   covering and returning kickoff pretty well but ranking  th in field goal efficiency   th in punt return efficiency  and  th in punt efficiency  not great <BRK>ford s gone  so there will be a new place kicker for better or worse  and in theory punt will improve simply because punter jared porter is no longer a freshman <BRK>you never get back missed opportunity  and when you re ulm  you don t just get a ton of opportunity  period  when a season end like   did  it can haunt you for a while and lead to you chasing ghost <BRK>this year s schedule feature just a little margin for error a lat year s  and every year s for ulm   and the talent bae ha just a much upside and downside  that mean bowl eligibility will likely come down to the wire once more  can evans make a few more pases behind schedule and flip a close game or two  can the defense maintain lat year s late seaon improvement  and can the warhawks avoid laying an egg like they did against georgia state  having minimal margin for error mean no giveaway when you ve got a winnable game <BRK>viator took on a thankless job three year ago  i admire him for taking it on  and he ha done an admirable job  he ll have to keep right on coaching well to give his team a shot at something greater than near miss <BRK>all   preview data to date <BRK>
