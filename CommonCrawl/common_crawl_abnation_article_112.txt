every parent hope their kid will follow in their footstep when it come to sport allegiance  but ben affleck went one step further when his   year old son sheridan said he wasn t a fan of boston sport  <BRK> affleck explained during an interview on jimmy kimmel live friday night  <BRK>  i wa telling my   year old  my son particularly   we re really excited   co we re from boston  and this is a big deal   and the red sox  and i m giving him the whole history  and he listens to me  and then he stop and go  dad  you re from boston  i m from la  and i had a full existential crisis  i failed  i m a bad father   this is a disaster       so i had some guy do a little work to my son s room to help him really understand where he come from   <BRK> so  to recap  affleck s son told him he s from los angeles  which is true   so he didn t have a love of boston sport  so  instead of accepting that  crestfallen a he might be   affleck did something about it   and this  something  wa kind of banana   <BRK>  so what you did is once your son indicated that maybe he d be interested in rooting for the team that he grew up around  you decided to just attack him with interior decorating    <BRK>  that s what we do with our child  we take our neurosis and put it on them    <BRK> affleck joked that when his son is in therapy he can show the psychologist the clip of his dad explaining why he redecorated his bedroom and it will all make sense   <BRK>
