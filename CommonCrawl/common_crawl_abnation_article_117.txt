sport curse aren t a real thing but i d understand if saint fan are asking why they deserve this  <BRK>a year and six day after getting the bad end of one of the greatest playoff finish in nfl  sport   history  they suffered arguably one of the greatest injustice in nfl history  what looked like a blatantly obvious pas interference penalty to everyone except the attending referee wasn t flagged  if it had been  the saint would have almost certainly advanced to the super bowl  they could have scored a touchdown  or at worst  run the clock down to well inside a minute before kicking what would have been an easy field goal near the goal line to take the lead late in the game <BRK>instead  the ram had     and a timeout to run an ot forcing drive  drew brees then threw an ugly interception to give the ball back to the ram needing only a field goal to win   which greg zuerlein promptly did on a   yarder <BRK>this just in  on the pontchartrain causeway    pic twitter com  lnryw b<BRK>to recap  the saint were also eliminated from the playoff on a walk off play last year when rookie cornerback marcus williams whiffed a tackle on viking receiver stefon diggs  who went   yard to the end zone to advance his team to the nfc championship and send the saint home  <BRK>sunday s heartbreak wa a touch le dramatic  but perhaps even more nauseating  the saint were a win away from the super bowl with a real chance to win their second title ever  the   team won   game and a division title  but it wa a no    seed  not a no     the   saint tied a franchise record with   win  and drew brees had one of the most magical season of his career  guiding the league s no    scoring offense while breaking the league s career passing yard record with a personal best passer rating  <BRK>sean payton couldn t contain his heartache after the game <BRK>payton said the call is tough to get over   we ll probably never get over it  <BRK>payton said he hope no other team ha to lose again like that <BRK>those could have easily been his reaction to last season s loss  too  <BRK>and yes  there were plenty of other way that the saint could have won sunday s game  drew brees struggled in the second half and certainly overtime against a keyed up ram defense  and the ram moved the ball consistently following their first possession of the second half  <BRK>but then again  the ram made plenty of their mistake of their own  including head coach sean mcvay s decision to kick a field goal on fourth down at the saint    yard line with five minute left in regulation  the saint were in a position to win when that fateful no call occurred because mcvay had his team play for overtime instead of the win <BRK>i thought the saint were the better team sunday  that s fine if you disagree  and of course  football is a great sport in part because of how fickle and mean and wild it can be  <BRK>none of that really matter next to the pain of being a saint fan right now  though  everyone should be able to agree that this ha to be one of the punishing pair of consecutive playoff exit ever  and if you re a falcon fan  feel free to enjoy the hell out of it   <BRK>just remember <BRK>sport curse aren t real <BRK>sport curse aren t real <BRK>sport curse aren t real <BRK>probably <BRK><BRK>
