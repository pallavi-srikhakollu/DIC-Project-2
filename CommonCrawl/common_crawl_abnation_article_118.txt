landon collins  tyrann mathieu  and earl thomas are three of only eight nfl player who hit free agency this month and flew off the market with a contract that average over      million per year <BRK>mathieu got three year and    million from the chief  thomas landed with the raven for four year and    million  but collins wa the biggest winner with a six year     million deal from wahington   the richest deal ever for a safety <BRK>it make sense to invest in the position  the   season set record for league wide passer rating        completion percentage      percent   and touchdown pass      it certainly doesn t hurt to have a reliable defensive back in the middle of the field to help slow down that onslaught <BRK>that s why it wa so strange to see safety struggle to get money on the market in    it looked like   would be another bad year for the position when collins  mathieu  and thomas were all allowed to reach the market  while player like eric weddle  tashaun gipson  and eric berry were released  instead  all but berry were signed at the start of the new league year <BRK>that s a hugely talented group of player  so it s not surprising that nfl team parsed through the rank  but the big money they received wa in stark contrast to how the market treated safety a year ago <BRK>when mathieu refused a pay cut from the arizona cardinal in march    he wa released and hit the free agency market hopeful to find money that made the decision worthwhile  one report said he wa aiming to get a contract that averaged    million per year <BRK>from the top   free agent  to mock draft  to scouting report  we ve got everything you need to get through the offseason  all in one place <BRK>instead  he settled for a one year     million  prove it  deal with the houston texan <BRK>that wa the best contract any free agent safety got in    then there wa a three year       million deal for kurt coleman with the saint and a three year       million deal for morgan burnett with the steelers  other safety   like kenny vaccaro  eric reid  and tre boston   had to wait month for a contract <BRK>having reid on the market may have been part of the problem  safety mike mitchell  who wa a free agent in   until the colt signed him in october  and other source told the athletic that  nfl team took an intentionally cool approach toward free agent safety in   to avoid the appearance of collusion against eric reid   <BRK>whatever it wa  the nfl seemed to seriously undervalue the position and left many safety on the open market <BRK> it s kind of unbelievable to me   boston told sirius xm radio in   after a couple disappointing week of free agency   we re talking about a position that s needed more and more on the field in today s game <BRK> there are about five or six valuable starting safety in free agency right now  but i guess it s jut trying to get u to take peanut like the rest of them have  that s jut the buiness of the game  <BRK>boston eventually signed a one year deal with the cardinal worth      million  so far  he han t found a new team in   and sits  nd on our list of the top free agent  boston is one spot higher than vaccaro   who settled for the same deal a boston lat year with the titan  this year  he stayed with tennessee  cahing in with a four year     million contract <BRK>reid wa finally signed by the panther near the end of september to a one year deal with a    million base salary  and played well enough to earn a three year     million extension from the team <BRK>the crop of safety that hit the market in   wa undoubtedly better than the one from    but this time around wa a much better foray into free agency for mathieu  vaccaro  and the safety position  in general <BRK>when the salary for franchise tag were released at the beginning of march  only tight end and kicker punter had a lower number than safety <BRK>it only cost      million to franchise a safety   le than half the      million price tag to franchise a quarterback   and the giant still decided it wa too rich to use to retain landon collins <BRK>now  collins  mathieu  and thomas are the three highest paid player at the position  no other position saw a reversal like that <BRK>new contract for trey flower and dee ford made them the fourth  and sixth highest paid pas rusher in the nfl  nick foles became the  th highest paid quarterback  inside linebacker c j  mosley wa the only non safety to set a new standard at his position by signing a five year     million deal with the jet <BRK>then again  no other position had so much top end talent hit free agency  still  there are a number of young defensive back starring in the middle of a secondary  and any increase in the value of safety is great news for them  eddie jackson  jamal adam  kevin byard  and derwin james are all on rookie deal and stand to cash in big with extension soon   <BRK>the contract for safety in   have been surprising after the market wa so dead a year ago  but there s no reason to expect it plunge again  now it look like   wa the outlier all along <BRK>
