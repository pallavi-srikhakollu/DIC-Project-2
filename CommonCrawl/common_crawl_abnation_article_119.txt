we all know how   went for dexter fowler  simply put  it wa ugly  but we ll get to that in a second  first we ll step back even a bit further  <BRK>in    fowler s first year with the cardinal  he wa a strong  stabilising force in the redbird lineup  even if not in exactly the way it wa planned out  brought in to be the leadoff hitter that could finally allow matt carpenter to hit in a spot with more chance for run production  both fowler and carpenter struggled early in the seaon  then saw better result when they were swapped in the lineup  magical thinker believe it wa because carp wa back in the leadoff spot  regress to the mean type believe it wa simply a matter of time  pragmatist didn t much care either way  so long a the player were playing well regardless of how the dusty baker lineup dice landed when matheny rolled them up for the day  feel free to sort yourself into one of the three appropriate bucket  <BRK>despite the strangeness of the lineup shuffling and accompanying argument  the fact wa that dex did baically what the cardinal brought him in to do when he had a bat in his hand  in just under   plate appearance  fowler posted a          line  he got on bae  posting a walk rate just under     and kept his strikeout rate well under control at       his   wrc  wa a step down from what he had done in his final seaon in chicago  when he posted a    but that wa mostly down to a drop in his babip from    in    unsustainable   to    in    much more normal looking   in term of peripheral  dex essentially maintained the kind of production he wa known for a the you go  we go leadoff man for the cub  <BRK>what wa maybe the most pleaant surprise wa the power surge fowler showed off in his first seaon wearing red  he hit eighteen home run  the highest total of his career  eclipsing his previous high of seventeen  which had come in almost   more plate appearance in    from   to     dex jumped from thirteen to eighteen bomb  hit double and triple at approximately the same rate a before  and saw his isolated slugging jump from    to    a a result  the cardinal went and signed fowler to be a high on bae hitter sitting at the top of the lineup  and they got mostly that  with a bonus touch of extra power  <BRK>it wa maybe a bit of a surprise to see dex muscling up and hitting more homer  particularly seeing a how his new home ballpark in   wa busch stadium  a far more difficult place to put the ball over the wall than wrigley field  which depending on the wind can play extremely cozy  but it also made some sense  this wa dexter fowler  a very disciplined and intelligent hitter  recognising his role on the team and his evolving skillet a a player moving into his thirty   old player skill  ha a certain connotation  often a negative one  but it s not necessarily a pejorative descriptor  older player evolve and adapt  and what that generally mean is they become more patient  they go deeper in count  they focus more on power  and they sacrifice some contact  speed becomes le important  loft and power become more important  <BRK>so it seemed to be going with fowler in    he stole fewer bae  going from thirteen steal in   to just seven in     and his baerunning value a a whole dropped  but he had that extra power to make up for it  what wa interesting wa that dex made those change while not actually sacrificing any contact  his strikeout rate actually fell from    to     while his walk rate dropped a touch a well  so it wa mostly older player skill manifesting  but not entirely  it seemed  <BRK>the biggest concern  really  wa that fowler s center field defense  long a source of some consternation  wa downright terrible in    there wa this narrative floating around when the card signed fowler that his defense had been magically improved by the cub coach telling him to simply move back deeper in center field  either the cardinal braintrust lack the ability to come up with similarly amazing insight like   um  i don t know  just move back a little   or the mythmaking surrounding the   cub enrobed a flukily good defensive seaon in the all pervading glow of breaking the curse and the card really shouldn t have bought into fowler suddenly not being a bad center fielder  a he had always been before  again  feel free to sort yourselves into school of belief here  <BRK>and then came    and we all know how that went  it wa ugly  i feel like i ve written this before  <BRK>honestly  it s hard to really talk about dexter fowler s   season  most of the time when you re looking at a disappointing year someone had  you break down what went wrong  and try to figure out which part of that failure are red flag  which part are easily explained by poor luck result which should regress over time  and where to look for optimism regarding a possible bounceback campaign  <BRK>the problem with   and dexter fowler is that  simply put  everything went wrong  and when everything go wrong  there s not a lot of analysis one can do  when a building suffers some structural failure  you look for the cause  and try to figure out if the design failed  or the material  or the construction  or what  if a building fails after an earthquake  you try to figure out if the earthquake wa simply too strong  or if the building could somehow have been planned better to withstand mother nature s occasional onslaught  if a building fails after getting hit by a meteor  there s not a lot you can do  you write down  hit by meteor  on the line at the bottom of the inspection form  and in the recommended action box you write  hope for fewer meteor   sometimes thing just blow up  <BRK>dexter fowler in   wa one of the very worst player in baseball  he came to bat   time  and posted a   wrc   that s just barely over half his   number  which should give some idea just how drastic the sudden falloff wa  his babip cratered  going from    to a near apocalyptic     and that didn t look to be the product of bad luck  rather  fowler simply didn t hit the ball well in    at all  the power disappeared  his iso fell from    to     his strikeout rate stayed roughly where it had been  but his walk rate declined a touch more from    to     and the overall result wa a player who didn t get on base  had absolutely no ability to drive the ball for power  and no longer appeared to have the wheel to make any of his lesser on contact ability work for him  from   to     fowler s triple total went from seven  to nine  to zero  that  more than anything else  is probably the number that explains most of where dex s production number went  <BRK>the defense wa also a huge negative  fowler moved from center field to right  bowing to both age and tommy pham s previous defensive excellence in small sample  but moving to a corner did dex no favour  in about   inning  roughly half a seaon   in right field  fowler posted    defensive run saved  uzr   saw him a a      run fielder  a bad a the offensive side of his game wa in    dex s defense wa really no better  it all combined to put fowler at      win above replacement for the   seaon  which is baically the meteor hitting the building number  <BRK>i don t want to rehah all the mike matheny drama when it come to fowler  matheny wa a terrible manager  he lost his player after keeping his job so long only because the organisation believed he had intangible  clubhouse value  and now he s gone  dex had a small bit of resurgence after mike shildt took over  but not much more than one might clasify a a dead cat bounce were one interested in colloquialism of early  th century america  and then he broke his foot  mercifully ending his disater of a seaon  sometimes bad thing just happen  and all you can do is try to move forward  <BRK>and that s just what fowler seemed to do this offseaon  by all account  he rededicated himself over the winter  worked extremely hard on his body and health  and came into spring training ready to put the   seaon in the rearview mirror and reclaim his position a an early order force  a well a an outfield fixture  <BRK>which is where we really run into a problem  for both dexter and the cardinal  <BRK>this spring  fowler ha come to bat   time  he ha walked just twice       bb rate   struck out ten time     k rate   and is hitting           he ha not hit a home run  he ha not hit a triple  he ha one double  we don t keep wrc  number for spring training  but there is baically no offensive environment anywhere in which a    ops is going to be seen a a positive  <BRK>now  let s take a moment to acknowledge that it is spring training  and being spring training  not only do the game not count  but the result of individual player are difficult to trust and take all that seriously  plenty of guy are working on specific thing  trying to make alteration or improvement to their game that can put them temporarily in a bad spot a they try to incorporate whatever it is they re shooting for  i m not particularly worried about the cardinal offense a a whole  in spite of the fact they ve looked pretty terrible this spring  simply because i ve seen a lot of spring training in my life  and i can say without equivocation that the regular seaon never really look all that much like what you thought you were going to get when watching game in march  <BRK>so we definitely have to keep that in mind  process  not result  is what team   and player   focus on in training camp  and by most account fowler doe look healthier and stronger than he did at any point last season  <BRK>but even so  it s hard to look at those number and not be worried  i ve watched a few spring training game  and have yet to see dex make any sort of contact that caused me to perk up and take notice in a positive way  there wa at least one fly ball early in spring game fowler missed that wa really  really galling  he hasn t looked much better this spring playing the outfield in general than i remember from last year  though admittedly it s hard to judge that sort of thing in such a small sample  <BRK>the problem is  small sample are all we have right now  and all we re going to get until the regular seaon start  and the problem with that is that once the regular seaon start  the game count  and regardless of what you may think of what the cardinal did over the offseaon  i think we can all agree they are going to be in a dogfight this year  one in which every single game will be important  if the   model year of dexter fowler is going to have the same problem a the   model  the cardinal just cannot afford to run him out on the field all seaon  <BRK>the whole situation is made more fraught  of course  by the number of option the cardinal have in the outfield  but also the lack of guaranteed success  marcell ozuna still doesn t seem to have his shoulder health under control  harrison bader still can t hit a slider  tyler o neill only hit home run  apparently  a his spring babip is about     which i m fairly certain is hurting his    ops at leat a little  even so  his strikeout rate is still worrisomely high  and while he certainly look the part of a plus defender  we don t have much a track record to go on  jose martinez can really hit  but in the field he   can really hit  in short  dexter fowler is part of a huge clutch of outfielder  all of whom could be good  but none of whom are lock to be  and that make dex himself a much harder keep on the roster  if there wa guaranteed production from center and left  maybe you could afford to be patient  if there were no other option  you would baically be forced to be patient  but a thing stand  the cardinal need their best team on the field  and they can t wait all that long to get there  <BRK>yes  it s spring  and the sample size are still very small  there will not be a decision made on dexter fowler s future role with the team in march  unless something health related we don t yet know about pop up  but the cardinal of   don t have the luxury of time to carefully consider thing before making a decision  they play in possibly the most brutal division in the game  or perhaps the second toughest  depending on what one think of the nl east  and while they should be improved over last season  perhaps markedly so  this is not a team with enough of a buffer to figure thing out on the fly  <BRK>dexter fowler came into the spring looking better  looking healthier  than he had for a while  then the game started  and dex look uncomfortably like the guy who wa one of the worst player in baseball last year  it s too early to make a decision  probably  but it is not too early to worry a decision need to be made  definitely  <BRK>the spring ha not gone well for dexter fowler so far  and that is one of the worst piece of news the cardinal could have gotten  there is a day of reckoning that will have to be faced  and relatively soon  for the redbird and not just their plan of contending  but for the legitimacy of the front office  the   season cannot wait on dexter fowler  the fact he s doing what he ha done so far in the spring only tightens the screw on an organisation trying to climb back into relevance while sticking to it philosophy  crunch time is coming  sooner than anyone probably want to admit  <BRK>
