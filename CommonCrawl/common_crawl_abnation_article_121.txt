zion williamson is going to be the first pick in june s nba draft  this wa not immediately apparent at the start of the preseason  we had him no    on our initial board   but it s a lock now  the gap between williamson and whoever go no      teammate r j  barrett being the current frontrunner   is massive  <BRK> the only thing that can slow down williamson is a major injury  he suffered a minor one last weekend when he wa poked in the eye against florida state and missed the second half of duke s victory  he wa on the floor for a significant one earlier this week when teammate tre jones sprained his shoulder diving for a loose ball that will keep him out indefinitely   <BRK> this is the context to the conversation that s swirling around williamson at the moment  it s a conversation started by nba legend scottie pippen  who said zion should stop playing for duke immediately to avoid putting himself at risk for injury ahead of the draft  <BRK> here are pippen s word  transcribed  <BRK>  i think he s locked up the biggest shoe deal  i think he s definitely going to be the no    pick  i think he s done enough for college basketball that it s more about him personally   pippen said on espn s  the jump    i would shut it down  i would stop playing because i feel he could risk a major injury that could really hurt his career   <BRK> this ha become a talking point everyone ha an opinion on  we have some thought  too  <BRK> do not blame williamson for this conversation because he ha yet to even acknowledge it  duke is gearing up for one of the biggest game of the season on saturday when undefeated virginia visit durham  for williamson personally  this talk amount to nothing more than an unwelcome distraction  <BRK> the only reason people are talking about this is because pippen put the idea out into the void  it feel like the perfect topic for this moment in time when everything is debated endlessly on a variety of platform for a   hour newscycle  it s a topic custom built for stephen a  smith and skip bayless to scream about  <BRK> still  there s a reason why this isn t a ridiculous conversation to have  <BRK> high profile college football player projected at the top of the nfl draft have been choosing to sit out bowl game for a few year now  this wa famously done by running back leonard fournette and christian mccaffrey before they entered the draft  this year s projected no    pick  ohio state defensive end nick bosa  chose to leave school in october a he wa rehabbing an injury   <BRK> this is the first time this conversation ha happened in basketball  no one debated if deandre ayton  marvin bagley iii  and jaren jackson jr  should out last year  though tom izzo did his best to ensure jackson s health   given the overwhelming consensus that williamson is this year s top pick  the fact that we re having this conversation shouldn t be that surprising  <BRK> do you know who teenager look up to more than anyone else  older teenager  if zion did shut it down in the middle of the season  you can bet next year s top prospect like anthony edward  read my profile    cole anthony  and james wiseman would take notice  just like in football  it only take one star player to turn a conversation into a trend  <BRK> at least until the age limit is finally abolished  more on this later   <BRK>  i think he s done enough for college basketball  <BRK> this is true  college basketball ha had a lot of value for williamson  he wasn t the consensus no    pick coming into the season  being all over espn     ha certainly helped his marketing value  at this point  williamson might already be more famous than    of nba player  <BRK> he s also not getting anything more out of ncaa ball at this point  which is pippen s point  beating buffalo in the sweet   won t get zion a bigger rookie deal in the nba  winning a national championship probably won t get him any more endorsement money   <BRK> williamson s reputation a a player and image a a spokesman is already set  college baketball isn t doing anything for him at this point  however      <BRK> duke s pursuit of a national title with williamson leading the charge is going to be the biggest story in sport post super bowl  people are likely going to be talking about the ncaa tournament more than ever this season because zion will be in it  rating are going to be huge when he s playing  all of this mean the ncaa is making money  even if the the player shamefully cannot   <BRK> can you imagine the reaction of television and advertising executive if williamson chose to sit out  the man ha an entire economy swirling around him that he isn t even allowed to personally capitalize on yet  <BRK> mike krzyzewski didn t always embrace the one and done  it isn t hard to find story of coach k throwing a tantrum when corey maggette and william avery had the audacity to leave school early   year ago    <BRK> krzyzewski would be just furious if this hypothetically happened   and that would be delightful to duke hater everywhere  in fact      <BRK> barrett would be a top five pick if he didn t play another game  reddish would be a top   pick if he didn t play another game  it s possible duke s entire superstar trio of freshman could shut it down right now and still go       in the nba draft come june  <BRK> coach k would be so mad  there are duke hater around the world with a big  dumb smile on their face right now just considering this scenario   <BRK> if williamson did want to shut it down  he deserves to have unanimous support  pippen is right that he s already done enough for duke and for college baketball  anyone with half a brain should be able to see that williamson would be well within his right to maintain his body and his earning potential by ensuring he s healthy a he enters the nba  <BRK> but if he want to keep playing  hey  that s cool  too  watching zion williamson play basketball is great  and he s going to make the ncaa tournament so much more exciting   <BRK> seriously  part of the reason this dude is about to make billion is because he s so thoughtful and charismatic in front of a camera  you know these question are coming  it would be overwhelming for most   year old  but it likely won t be for williamson  <BRK> williamson s hyper competitiveness is one of the best thing about him  this is a player who competes with intensity on both end every second he s on the court  he s a team first player in every way  you only need to hear zion talk about the brotherhood  duke s newest self proclaimed nickname  for a minute to realize how important his lone college season is to him  <BRK> even if zion is well within his right to shut it down for the nba  he just doesn t seem like the type of player who would do that  but for those who come after him     <BRK> the nba is aiming to abolish the age limit by   or    it could be a few long year for college coach with top nba prospect on their team   <BRK> the player are well aware that everyone involved in college basketball is making money but them  you couldn t fault any athlete for choosing to ensure his long term future over playing for free  the only way to get out from under this discussion is giving the player the option to turn pro out of high school  until that happens  you can bet we ll be having this conversation every year  <BRK>
