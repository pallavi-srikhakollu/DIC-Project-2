football is more popular than baseball  this is true to such an extreme that i d wager jared goff is more recognizable than mike trout  even though i have no idea if goff is any good  that s just the way it is  and there s no point getting mad about it  if i wake up tomorrow morning and type   gonna write about darnson breeney and the twin  strategy of tandem chaining   the higher ups will pat me on the head and let me scurry away  they know whatever i write will get a hundredth of the traffic of an nfl mock draft  so whatever  <BRK> it s in this context that kyler murray decided to declare for the nfl draft  depending on where he s drafted  he will make a choice between baseball and football  he hasn t made a final decision yet  and that s an important point that folk seem to be overlooking  but he s probably going to choose football   <BRK> this potential outcome ha a substantial portion of baseball twitter in a defeated tizzy  of course player will choose the popular sport over the le popular sport  of course player will choose immediate success and fame over year of careful progress in the minor league  of course player will choose the sport that isn t currently in the news because salary are going down at the same time that revenue are going up  it all seems preordained when you put it like that   <BRK> but it s not that simple  so allow me to put a general guide together about the choice between professional baseball and professional football   <BRK> this isn t a question  if it is celebrity status that ye seek  choose the oblong sport ball  chris sale might be one of the best pitcher of his generation  but my guess is that people still ask him if he play basketball wherever he go  if he ha an endorsement deal that isn t related to baseball gear  it s hard to find with a quick google search   <BRK> just about every athlete who make the decision to play baseball professionally for the next   year will be le successful than chris sale  who can walk down the middle of a freeway in san francisco without being recognized  the fame that baseball brings is an extremely regional fame  <BRK> with the slotting system in the mlb draft  every first round pick know roughly what he s going to get a a bonus now  that s the only guaranteed money he s going to get for a while  unless he zoom through the minor  the player ha to make the bonus lat  there could be three or four year in the minor  and that s before another three or four year playing for something close to the minor league minimum  kyler murray might not accumulate a million dollar in baeball salary until    and that s if he get called up at all   <BRK> contrast that with what happens if he s a first round pick in the nfl   <BRK> if he s a first round nfl draft pick  at minimum he s looking at a four year     million deal with a    million signing bonus up front  based off projection at each pick slot  if he s a top   pick     million     million signing bonus  rookie nfl deal for first round player are guaranteed for four year  <BRK> josh booty made about      in major league salary  though he made more if you count the stack of camel cash that he wa paid over five minor league season  the calculation get even worse for drew henson   <BRK> it s better to be a high profile washout in the nfl than mlb  financially speaking  that s not a small consideration   <BRK> one of the many reason that the nfl draft is vastly more popular than the mlb draft is that  a lot of the player selected in the nfl draft will appear in an nfl game within five month  the number of baseball player who have made it to the major within five month of being drafted is freakishly tiny in comparison   <BRK> no  being a baseball player mean starting in short season a ball   <BRK> and then the next year moving up to low a  <BRK> hey  class a is after that  <BRK> maybe you get that double a promotion midseason  or maybe you don t  congrats  though  <BRK> then there s triple a  hang out here for a couple year  see what shake loose   <BRK> of course  this isn t the path that superstar take  mike trout went from high school to the major in two year  and college kid like alex bregman are there even sooner  but there s a chance  a great chance  that it ll be a long time before you wear the jersey of the team that drafted you   <BRK> peyton manning ha made more money over his career than any other football player who ha ever lived       million  this is a perfect number for comparison  because albert pujols wa guaranteed about that much money in a single contract that he received after he turned     <BRK> jaon heyward wa guaranteed almost a much money in a single eight year contract than ben roethlisberger ha made in his   year career   <BRK> this  like the question of which sport is likelier to make you famous  is not in dispute  will clark made    million  and he retired in    before salary got really wild  there are football star today   championship winning star   who won t get nearly that much   <BRK> if you sneer at mansion with just one olympic sized pool  then baseball is definitely for you   <BRK> this is the trickiest category  just about everyone who fails out of baseball is someone who had  to that point  never struggled at the sport in their life  ever  not just the best player on their high school team  so much better than everyone else in the league  that people in different city knew your name  not just one of the best player on their college team  so much better than everyone else that they re one of the lucky few who got drafted  et cetera   <BRK> with this a your background  of course you think that you will  stick around for a while   if that s the cae  baeball s you re bet  once you re in your arbitration year   maybe six or seven year after you re drafted   you ll start making nfl money  after that  when you re eligible for free agency  not only will you be making more than the comparable player in the nfl  but it will all be guaranteed money   <BRK> put it this way  if prince fielder will have made    million after playing his last mlb game  he would have made none of that if he were an nfl player suffering the same injury  for comparison  fielder will earn more money to not play baseball than randy moss ever made playing football   <BRK> baseball is not without it health risk  especially for catcher  but this is also not in dispute  football is like if baseball required fielder to get runner out by hitting them with baseball  and also  the baseball are   pound and the size of a vending machine   <BRK> i mean  i d watch  but it sound dangerous   <BRK> right now  jeff samardzija is somewhere either smoking a cigarette or rehabbing his shoulder  unless he s doing both at the same time because he s an absolute legend  but his brain is still good  in   year  his brain will probably still be good  and he ll have made more money over his career than joe thomas  who wa one of the best offensive linemen in nfl history   <BRK> because it ain t looking good for baeball at the moment  the good news  such a it is  is that the nflpa is so weak that it s hard to imagine a work stoppage there anytime soon  play away  football friend  play away   <BRK> note that this guide is for a high first round pick in football  for someone in the middle round  and especially for someone in the later round  forget it  ride the bus  kid  the baseball lottery ha long odds  but the football lottery come with a liquid meal downside   <BRK> but for a high first round pick like murray  here you go  and i m not going to come to a grand conclusion because that wouldn t be fair  if murray is realistic about the winding path and numerous pitfall that are underneath every young baseball player  murray wa drafted ninth overall  his uncle  calvin murray  wa drafted seventh overall  so you don t have to explain how tool might not always translate into success  might want to get that guaranteed money that football is offering  especially when it come with immediate action   <BRK> if murray think he ha a better chance to be an all star  though  that s different  there s nothing wrong with a little confidence  and a player willing to gamble on himself would be better off with baseball   <BRK> and it would appear that   yes  i m getting word that this is correct   there s also the matter of what murray prefers  doe he prefer the sport of football or the sport of baseball  the report i m seeing suggest that  choosing the sport that fill him with joy  should make a difference  strange but true   <BRK> football or baseball  for a high first round pick  there s a lot of thinking to do  and there s no real right answer  the most important thing to remember is that you shouldn t be a dingus and get mad at a player for choosing a livelihood based on his best interest  whatever kyler murray chooses  he ll have some compelling reasoning on his side  <BRK>
