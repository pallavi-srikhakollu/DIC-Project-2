of action that could eaily be described a  football   the league s combination of old pro and collegiate star churned through another set of four game  providing an oais in the football free stretch between super bowl   and the   nfl draft  <BRK> week   wa a showcase for some familiar face and overlooked player looking to jump start their gridiron career  so who left the biggest mark on last weekend s action  <BRK> bouagnon carried   time for   yard and a touchdown against birmingham  which count a a veritable offensive explosion given the early standard this league is setting  i liked

all time rushing leader s comeback kicked into gear saturday despite a     loss explained away by the fact christian hackenberg is his quarterback  he became the first player in league history to record a   yard rushing game when he carved up the arizona hotshot despite zero semblance of a passing game in front of him   hackenberg needed   pass to throw for just   yard   <BRK> stacy s experience wa on full display throughout the game a he ran with a combination of power and patience that kept arizona reeling  <BRK> despite the loss  express rb zac stacy became the first   yard rusher in a game in aaf history pic twitter com puaagkkm f <BRK> his   rush yard are tied with ja quan gardner for the league lead  stacy will be   year old by the time the upcoming nfl season start

football career  he played his college ball at northern iowa and  while he wa there  won the buck buchanan award a the best defender in all of fcs in    that year  he had   sack and   tackle for loss  he had two and three against birmingham  with the sack coming two play apart in the first quarter   <BRK> here s the first  where he beat a tight end who wa supposed to at least chip him   <BRK> the iron could ve prevented that with a better back side seal  but it go to the point that you maybe shouldn t try to block schult with a tight end or back   <BRK> and here s the second  where he deal with a chipping tight end before beating the left tackle cleanly and forcing a fumble on a sack   <BRK> he generated at least one other pressure all on his own late in the game  he continually bothered the iron s luis perez  who wa the aaf s best qb in week      alex kirshner <BRK> marshall will forever have a place in aaf history  lat week  he scored the first touchdown in the league s debut  an athletic grab that wa initially ruled incomplete but then overturned a we got a peek at a policy the nfl should adopt  transparent instant replay  the former high school quarterback even added a philly special style touchdown pas later on  <BRK> this week  he missed his second shot at a touchdown pas when his lob to charles johnson fell incomplete  yet he made his other moment count  including this catch up the middle that he turned into a   yard gain thanks to a couple of good move  <BRK> an absolute dime from garrett gilbert to  jalinmarshall   takeaim    orlvssa pic twitter com eiluyjn qu <BRK> the apollo  now      were behind all game to the san antonio commodore until marshall s score tied thing up in the fourth quarter  <BRK> scissors concept for the touchdown to jalin marshall  pic twitter com moc s qnbl <BRK> they never looked back  <BRK> marshall s stats weren t eye popping sunday  three catch for   yard and the touchdown   but his route were impressive and the attention the defense gave him helped open thing up for johnson   who finished with seven reception for   yard and a touchdown  to dominate   <BRK> at only    the former jet receiver and return man is doing everything he can to earn another shot at the nfl    sarah hardy <BRK> marshall wa great  but orlando s biggest star sunday wa johnson  who exploded for seven catch and an absurd   yard  the former packer draft pick wa unstoppable down the field  averaging     yard per target in week   s highest scoring game  <BRK> charles johnson  deep for   yard pic twitter com t z w nnr <BRK> johnson s got   more receiving yard than anyone else in the league through two week  while he wa never quite able to follow up an explosive rookie seaon in    the three year nfl veteran still ha some jet a he inch closer to age      christian d andrea <BRK> the former no    overall pick had a very trent richardson stat line on the ground  carrying the ball   time for   yard  but he wa impactful in the pasing game  where his six reception for   yard led the iron  his   yard touchdown plunge with     to go in the fourth quarter served a the game s deciding point in a     rock fight    christian d andrea <BRK> nelson s number were categorically bad sunday  he completed only   of his   pass for   yard and an interception  and while he wa able to run the ball for   yard  he wa also sacked three time  <BRK> this wa not one of those time  instead  it is art  <BRK>     how  this may be the craziest completion ever  pic twitter com  ilyd sysz <BRK> nelson ha never played a down in the nfl and is unlikely to  because once you ve done that  there are no more world left to conquer    christian d andrea <BRK>
