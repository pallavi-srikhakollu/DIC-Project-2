    with a bright new coach and a promising generation of young player    like christian pulisic  tyler adam  and josh sargent    the usmnt may be on the brink of a renaissance  sb nation take a look at the player and idea refueling american soccer 
   <BRK> supporter of the u s  men s national soccer team can often point to a moment when they knew christian pulisic wa the one  the man who would become the best player the national team had ever seen  i knew for sure after his solo goal to open scoring in a must win qualifier against panama   <BRK> the technique wa fantatic  the touch to drag jozy altidore s layoff into his path  the pace to race away from star defender roman torres  the rounding of the keeper  the finish from a tight angle  but for me  the moment wa a much about the celebration  it wa angry  a knee slide  a jersey pull  and attitude  like he really wa the wonder boy  it wa his mentality a much a his talent that i knew would make him a star   <BRK> then the usmnt went down to couva  lost to trinidad and tobago s b team  and missed the world cup  bruce arena s tenure ended with a deafening thud  national team star like clint dempsey  tim howard  michael bradley  and altidore were shelved or put out to pature  the u s  soccer federation spent a year in the wilderness  with caretaker manager dave sarachan doing all he could in a suboptimal situation  the team finally hired a permanent manager with some promise in gregg berhalter  but match against italy and brazil served a painful reminder that there s a long way to go to compete with the best  <BRK> and a the u s  national team sat in neutral  pulisic endured a similar lull in his career   both for club and country  he wrote a piece in the player  tribune about how much the loss in couva affected him  after acing seemingly every test in his young career  he s finally met resistance  he didn t play for the national team between may and november due to injury and fatigue  at borussia dortmund  an even brighter  younger star who played pulisic s same position showed up in   year old british starlet jadon sancho  and jacob bruun larsen  a   year old dane  also challenged pulisic for playing time  making it hard for pulisic to consistently crack the     <BRK> rumor of a winter transfer swirled  on january    the kid from hershey officially signed with chelsea for a fee of more than    million  he will finish out the season on loan at dortmund before officially moving to stamford bridge in the summer  <BRK> thus  christian pulisic s career is at a crossroad  a relatively benign crossroad where every road likely lead somewhere good  but a crossroad nonetheless  there s still no doubt that he s the one  the transfer fee that chelsea paid more than tripled the previous high for an american player  he is also the third most expensive player in chelsea s history  and the blue aren t stranger to spending spree  no one need to sound an alarm  but is he the one who becomes a top   player globally  or the one who becomes a starter at a really good club  where exactly is his ceiling  and how can he get there  <BRK> pulisic isn t the first player to face those question  to answer them  let s look to the past at three player   spain s bojan krkic  belgium s eden hazard  and  of course  the united state  landon donovan   who could play like he doe  and who shouldered the burden of an entire nation s footballing hope to varying degree of success   <BRK> bojan krkic wa one of world football s most hyped wonder boy of recent memory  like pulisic  bojan wa born to be a footballer  his father  bojan sr   worked for barça a a scout for more than a decade and played professionally for red star belgrade  bojan jr  accumulated more than   goal in the club s youth rank after joining la maia  fc barcelona s legendary academy  at eight year old   <BRK> bojan cracked the first team at barcelona at    when bojan scored against villarreal in october    finishing a pas from lionel messi  he became the club s youngest ever goalscorer   <BRK> the previous record holder  messi   <BRK> when he made his debut for spain in    bojan wa the second youngest player that la roja had ever capped  in his first champion league season  he scored against schalke in the quarterfinal  though manager pep guardiola wa hard on bojan after taking over barcelona   before that  bojan had abandoned guardiola s b team for frank rijkaard s first team   it seemed like he would have a long career at his boyhood club   there are only a few player who have a magical touch   guardiola admitted   and bojan is one of them    <BRK> the messi comparison were inevitable  though three year younger  bojan had the same floppy haircut  the same     stature  and the same quick foot  the only difference  bojan wa actually the fan favorite  unlike messi  an argentine  bojan wa a local product  a catalonian kid   <BRK> but breaking messi s record turned out to be a curse for bojan   too much  too fast   overnight  i couldn t even walk down the street   he told british journalist sid lowe in     i couldn t go to a birthday party or to the cinema   his mentor  rijkaard  left the club in    making way for guardiola whose distaste for bojan wa hard for bojan to shake  and he moved to rom in    though he scored more than   goal for barcelona s first team  he never recaptured the magic that he regularly produced with the youth squad  bojan now ply his trade at stoke city in the english second division   <BRK> notably  bojan got a raw deal from the spanish federation  he more recently revealed to lowe that he had an anxiety attack before his first match with spain in    a a result  he decided not to attend the euro that summer  the national headline read   spain call up bojan and bojan say no   presumably baed on what the federation told journalist  the national backlah wa swift and ruthless  <BRK> though he s now a cautionary tale for prodigious player  bojan is finding joy in his craft once more  he s said that he enjoys playing in stoke  away from social medium and the trapping of modern football  finding a sort of purity in the experience   <BRK> from the lowe interview in may    <BRK>  i love football and no one will ever take that from me  i m proud of my career  proud of what i have lived  and even if there are hard moment  including this year  you have to be strong  i will always love football  always  i m still young  i enjoy playing  and i have no intention of stopping yet   <BRK> bojan s story demonstrates the importance of playing in the right situation for both club and country  fortunately  pulisic ha already avoided some of the pitfall that bojan had to confront  whereas bojan had the pressure of being the local savior  the catalonian kid at barça  pulisic chose to play his soccer abroad  like messi moving to barcelona or antoine griezmann crossing the pyrenees to play for real sociedad  he chose to launch his career at a club famous for developing young player   <BRK> bojan also show just how heavy the burden of expectation can be  and how pulisic deal with similar burden will certainly influence his ceiling  at leat at dortmund   for now  a he finish out his seaon   pulisic can be simply a regular contributor  free from the expectation that he carry with the u s  national team  in germany  he also benefit from the mentorship of nuri sahin  who himself wa a wunderkind who once set a record a the youngest ever bundesliga debutant  first appearing for dortmund s first team at the age of   in    <BRK>  i ve come into a bigger role with the national team in the u s   but i think the environment here  at dortmund  definitely help   pulisic said in an interview with espnfc in     just being a good team player with this team  just being a piece of the puzzle is really important for me   <BRK> pulisic ha also deliberately pushed back against the wonder boy label with the u s  national team  he wrote in the player  tribune   <BRK>  i m not a prodigy   or a  wonderboy   a some have put it  i wa always  you know  a decent player growing up  and yes  i wa born with a certain amount of so called  natural ability   but i also worked and sacrificed a lot to try to maximize what i wa born with   which i think is important to point out   <BRK> mentality matter a lot   pulisic is right   great player aren t simply product of  natural ability   but pulisic s career also took off so quickly in large part because dortmund provided such strong development opportunity at youth level  it wa the perfect place for him  to avoid a bojan like career  it will help if pulisic s next situation suit him just a well a dortmund did   <BRK> though it go against manager maurizio sarri s system  chelsea ideally would let pulisic play more in his preferred no    position  where he excels for the usmnt  because it s at the international level  of course  where pulisic s legacy will truly be tested  <BRK> landon donovan is still blown away by how young he really wa a an   year old bursting onto the scene in the early  s  <BRK>  when i look back at myself in old clip  i am such a kid   he told roger bennett in     i wa just the young kid that would run and run and run  i played with this youthful exuberance  and i miss being able to play that way   <BRK> fortunately  that youthful exuberance   along with the absence of social medium in the early  s   helped insulate him from the pressure of being both the star of a national team and the torch bearer for an entire sport in a country that wa still learning to love soccer   <BRK>  i wa lucky enough to be young  naive  and ignorant   he say during a phone interview   i played without worrying about what it all meant   <BRK> donovan cemented his wonder boy status when he scored the goal that sealed the usmnt s victory against mexico in the round of   at the   world cup  suddenly  even casual sport fan in the u s  were following soccer  and the player on the team finally had name recognition  john o brien  brian mcbride  eddie lewis  brad friedel  claudio reyna  earnie stewart  damarcus beasley   <BRK> and  more than anyone  landon donovan  he wa   year old  he loved ssx tricky  and he wa  like pulisic  the face of the united state men s national team   <BRK> that world cup changed his life  between   and    soccer blossomed in the united state  but it position seemed tenuous  a if a failure could undo much of what donovan and his teammate on the   squad had worked for  he began to feel a constant pressure to perform   not only for his teammate  but also for the future of soccer in america  <BRK> the   world cup in germany wa a turning point  despite managing a draw against italy  the usmnt failed to advance from the group stage after earning just a single point at the tournament  medium coverage  which had been largely positive to that point  laid the failure at donovan s foot  beyond the result  he worried how soccer would hold up in the wake of an early world cup exit  <BRK>  i felt like i had failed my sport and my country   he say   <BRK> that exit wa one of donovan s first brush with the ugly side of the beautiful game  <BRK>  until that world cup  it had always been positive  positive  positive   he told bennett   that  for me  wa a massive ego hit  it wa shattering  to think of yourself and see yourself in almost this ideal  perfect way  and all of a sudden  it s like   oh  you re not that good  one   you let u down  two   and three  if you don t do well  we don t give a fuck about you    <BRK> he considered retirement  but decided to keep playing after talking to his family  his agent  and other close friend  he realized that he had to adopt a more even keel approach to the sport to avoid the unsustainable high and low emotional cycle it can put athlete through  <BRK> donovan became the greatest player the usmnt had ever seen  his career zenith wa a stoppage time goal against algeria at the   world cup  the ian darke shouting   go  go  usa   goal  the most iconic goal in u s  national team history  <BRK> later that summer   the one between my junior and senior year of high school   i played in a pickup soccer game  at least half the people there were wearing donovan s no    usmnt jersey  in july  the goal against algeria won the   espy for best moment  in august  hoodie allen released a song with the line   got the world on my leg   landon donovan   <BRK> just a bojan wa inevitably compared to messi  pulisic inevitably get compared to donovan  both stand      both signed with storied german club in their teen  and both can play on the wing or a a no     both were hyped a savior for the usmnt before they could legally drink  <BRK> but usmnt supporter readily point out that each chose differently when faced with the decision between playing in europe and staying home  the easy narrative state that pulisic chose the crucible and donovan chose to remain in his comfort zone  spending most of his career playing in major league soccer in los angeles  <BRK> most analyst argue that pulisic ha already accomplished more than any other american in europe  this is true  no other american ha ever earned consistent minute for a top   club in the world  no other american is the youngest foreign born goal scorer in the bundesliga  no other american ha ever given marcelo work multiple time and set up the tying goal against real madrid in a key champion league match  <BRK> during our phone conversation  donovan is mindful not to heap too many expectation on pulisic   we put so much on his shoulder   he say  a such  he doe not overtly name pulisic a his successor  although he doe acknowledge that  stylistically  we re quite similar   <BRK> but there s a key difference between the two  pulisic and donovan value different thing in life  and always have  <BRK> despite his accomplishment  donovan wa never an easy read for supporter  he wa the greatest talent the national team had ever seen  but he preferred southern california sunrise and proximity to his family over any obligation he might have felt to prove himself abroad  he consistently challenged fan  expectation for elite athlete by being thoughtful  introspective  and willing to say and do exactly what he feel   <BRK>   major league soccer  wa an absolute dream come true for my sanity  my happiness   he told bennett   i had no interest in going to europe and being the  th guy on a roster  training every day of the week but never playing  and then waking up at   year old and going   wow  where did my  s go  where did my life go    <BRK> donovan didn t grow up dreaming of being a professional   i always felt like soccer chose me   he told bennett   i didn t choose soccer   <BRK> in contrat  pulisic wanted to be a pro at a young age  he dressed a a soccer player every halloween  when he wa grade school aged  he d ak his father mark   a former professional soccer player and a current coach   to toss ball to his left foot for him to volley  ensuring that he d be two footed when he grew up  the two of them watched real madrid match on saturday morning  and after starring against brazil at a youth tournament  pulisic moved to dortmund in   because of the club s reputation for player development  <BRK>  he s much more prepared than i wa   donovan say of pulisic   he s scored in big moment  he s made special play on a big stage  he s intelligent  he understands the game and how to contribute defensively   <BRK> when aked about where exactly pulisic s ceiling is  donovan highlight something else that he see a a difference between the two of them  <BRK>  i think his ceiling is much higher than mine wa at   year old  i think i wa able to squeeze just about all of the juice out of the orange  if he can even reach   percent or   percent of his potential  and do it for         year  he ll be the best player we ve ever had    <BRK> donovan belief that pulisic will reach that ceiling  and can do it simply  <BRK>  he need to play game   donovan say   people gave me a lot of shtick for not playing in europe  but i wa lucky enough to play in all of my team s game when i wa   year old  playing   game in ml is probably more valuable than playing a handful of game in the bundesliga  <BRK>  the most important thing is experience  and that will determine whether he becomes one of the          or   best player in the world   <BRK> if christian pulisic ever get a good a his future chelsea teammate eden hazard  the usmnt will be in fantatic shape  hazard is probably one of the   best player in the world and ha accomplished much more on a club and international level than pulisic ha  but before you immediately laugh off the comparison  consider the following  <BRK> player a  age        ligue   appearance    goal    assist      key pass per game      dribble per game <BRK> player b  age      bundesliga appearance    goal    assist    key pas per game      dribble per game   th in the bundesliga behind kingsley coman  naby keita  and bruma  <BRK> player a is     hazard at lille and player b is     pulisic at dortmund  in the tail end of    just before he turned    hazard encountered the first real setback of his career when belgium left him on the bench during a key euro   qualifier against kazakhstan  dogged by inconsistency  hazard said he didn t doubt his ability  but felt a if he wa in a rough patch   <BRK> hazard emerged emphatically from that rough patch  becoming the youngest player to win ligue   s player of the year award in      he would play an additional season at lille before moving to chelsea for a reported    million in    he wa   year old   <BRK> pulisic still hasn t turned   and he s already played against much better competition than hazard had  featuring in key champion league fixture against club like real madrid and atlético de madrid  however  he too is in the midst of a rough patch   <BRK> hazard should be an attainable goal for pulisic  they have similar profile  they both have great pace and technical ability  and both are at their best when they re running at defender  both player also struggle for end product   their mazy  elegant run occasionally ending in a skewed shot or a misplaced cross   <BRK> hazard is still prone to lapse in consistency  too  producing four goal and three assist during jose mourinho s final season at chelsea ending in    until this season  which is off to a fantastic start  hazard had never managed more than     shot per   minute in the premier league   <BRK> the two are similar enough that it s possible that the blue think of pulisic a an eventual like for like replacement for hazard  who continues to leave the door open for a dream move to real madrid  likely playing on opposite wing to start  pulisic ha the chance to show he can approach the belgian s level if he can beat out pedro and willian   <BRK> if you squint hard enough  you can also draw parallel between pulisic and hazard s international career  before this current boom period for belgium s national team  their greatest achievement wa a   olympic gold in which the other finalist  czechoslovakia  protested the officiating by forfeiting at halftime  belgium were not a storied soccer nation on the level of germany  spain  or france  they probably weren t much more storied than the current version of the usmnt  <BRK> that all changed with the arrival of hazard  kevin de bruyne  romelu lukaku  vincent kompany  toby alderweireld  thibaut courtois  dry mertens  and company  the golden generation completely altered belgium s footballing fortune  and hazard   who  like pulisic  debuted with his national team at   year old   wa the transcendent player  it may seem like fan fiction to compare the two   there s debate whether talent is flowing in or out of the usmnt player pool at the moment   but it seems like pulisic could still lead his generation  along with weston mckennie  tyler adam  josh sargent  tim weah  zach steffen  ethan horvath  and others  back to the top of concacaf  at the very least   <BRK> the main difference between the two  hazard rarely loses the ball  while pulisic struggle to keep it  hazard is stocky and pulisic is wiry  it s almost impossible to pry the ball from hazard  who leverage that low center of gravity by using quick change in pace and direction  pulisic is more of a glider  more classically mesmerizing  and also more prone to getting knocked off the ball  per squawkwa  hazard completed   of his   take ons during the     premier league season    percent   during the same bundesliga season  pulisic completed   of his   take ons    percent   losing the ball more in that scenario than any other player in europe   <BRK> it s clear then what pulisic need to do if he ha hazard like aspiration  lose the ball le and produce more   more goal  more assist  and more chance   <BRK> simple enough  <BRK> chelsea aren t a slam dunk for pulisic  he could fail to supplant willian and pedro and languish on the bench  if he doesn t make the leap  pulisic will eventually cross the threshold from a  young player  to a  player   there will be backlah for not living up to hype that he had no hand in stoking  a donovan experienced after the   world cup  <BRK> fortunately  there are always sign of progress with pulisic  a chipped finish in the champion league that he learned from aubameyang here  a perfect touch to round the keeper and finish off a last minute winner against hoffenheim there   <BRK> that s the exciting part  donovan mentioned squeezing all of the juice out of the orange  pulisic is a safe bet to do exactly that  whenever we get a glimpse into his world through interview or another article  he come across a an individual who is relentlessly focused on his craft  who want to maximize everything he s been given and become the best footballer he can  he s jiro ono behind the sushi counter  mile teller at the drumset  alex honnold in front of el cap   <BRK> at time  that mentality may work for and against him  we expect a lot out of pulisic in part because he sound like a single minded    year old professional  but every so often  we get a little reminder of just how young pulisic really is  when he tweet at justin bieber asking for concert ticket  or dab after his first bundesliga goal  or play fortnite with mckennie  we remember that he s still just    during these flash of youth  his potential seems limitless  yet  it s worth reminding ourselves that he s already accomplished a hell of a lot  and it s going to take time for him to fulfill his full potential   <BRK> it s fun to imagine where that ceiling might be  pulisic probably isn t an exact replica of bojan  donovan  or hazard  he likely won t end up at stoke anytime soon  and he d do well to reach the height of hazard  but whatever his ceiling  there s something to intrinsically appreciate about anyone who can claim to be the best soccer player in america and withstand the blast of scrutiny   <BRK> christian pulisic is a kid from hershey  pennsylvania  who glide with the ball and never met a defender he didn t want to run at  he s his own person and his own player  he could eaily be suiting up for croatia right now  and he ll be a joy for a long a we get to watch him   <BRK>
