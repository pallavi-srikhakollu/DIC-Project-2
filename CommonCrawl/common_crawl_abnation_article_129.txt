the new england patriot are headed to the super bowl for the third year in a row  because they re an eventuality that can t be stopped   <BRK> when the kansa city chief scored a go ahead touchdown with just over two minute left in regulation  you already knew that tom brady would lead a touchdown drive to save the day  and when the chief got a game tying field goal  you already knew how overtime would go once the patriot won the coin toss  <BRK> new england surgically picked apart the chief defense on a   play    yard drive that wa punctuated with a   yard touchdown by rex burkhead that ended the     win for the patriot  <BRK> next up are the los angeles ram  who punched their ticket to the super bowl with a     overtime win over the new orleans saint  it s another high powered offense and lackluster defense  if the afc championship wa any indication  the patriot can find a way to beat both  <BRK> at halftime  the high powered kansa city chief offense had only   yard in the afc championship and wa facing a     deficit  on the third play of the second half  patrick mahomes uncorked a   yard bomb to sammy watkins that set up the chief deep in new england patriot territory  <BRK> big play could win the ram a super bowl <BRK> patriot are a handful for any team <BRK> tom brady s legacy is untouchable <BRK> missed call cost the saint a super bowl trip <BRK> greg zuerlein kicked the ram to atlanta <BRK> where wa todd gurley v  new orleans  <BRK> belichick   brady  nine super bowl <BRK> the next play wa a   yard touchdown pas to travis kelce and   just like that   the chief were back in it  <BRK> that s who mahomes is  he s lightning in a bottle  who couldn t be stopped altogether by any defense in    but the first half showed that bill belichick is still very capable of shutting down the most dangerous offense by scheming them up   even if only for a little bit  <BRK> belichick s defense double teamed tyreek hill on almost every play  brought consistent pressure on mahomes  and wa physical with all of kansa city s receiver at the line of scrimmage  <BRK> it left the young quarterback without many option to throw to and not enough time to wait for receiver to get open  <BRK> mahomes is a wild man who can t be contained on every play  eventually he s going to get a chance to uncork a few pass and he wa brilliant when he did  it s hard to praise a defense too much for giving up   point and three touchdown pass  <BRK> but the chief offense wa held to   total yard and the blazing fast tyreek hill had only one reception in the game  that s all belichick and a patriot pas rush that ha been on a war path in the playoff  <BRK> if anyone can draw up a way to shut down the offense of sean mcvay and jared goff  it s the patriot  <BRK> the afc championship wa not the best version of brady  he threw two interception and wa fortunate to get away with a third that would ve ended the game had dee ford not been lined up in the neutral zone  <BRK> but brady is the best postseason quarterback in nfl history  because   when the game is on the line   you know he ll get the job done  he seemingly always doe  <BRK> in overtime  the chief put him in several tough spot  but brady found chris hogan  julian edelman  and rob gronkowski with well placed laser to win the game  <BRK> brady to edelman across the     nflplayoffs    nevskc on cbs pic twitter com  o vzaqh i <BRK> if the patriot are in a super bowl  it s probably going to be a great game that come down to the wire  the ram should expect to have to stop brady in the final minute  and   well   good luck with that  <BRK>
