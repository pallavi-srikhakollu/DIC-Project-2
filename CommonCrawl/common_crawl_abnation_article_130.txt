while it can be difficult to find positive from a     draw  not all are the same  the match between bayern munich and liverpool  though goalless  wa hardly boring  it wa a frantic contest with stellar display from many player who weren t forward  <BRK>i enjoyed it  and there a few particular event and individual who i thought were incredible <BRK>in comparison to their lean  speedy  tricky opponent in sadio mane  mo salah  and roberto firmino  the bayern player like joshua kimmich  niklas süle  mat hummels  and javi martinez all look like they spend most of their time in the wood chopping tree and dragging log back to their cabin with their hand  kimmich is the shortest of the group at      but he s wide and stocky  meanwhile  süle is     and weighs over   pound  hummels is     and    and martinez is     and    <BRK>the liverpool trio  and the rest of their small but agile player  put the advantage of their smaller size on display with deceitful turn in tight space  twisting and turning their defender inside out  it looked only a matter of time before the liverpool attacker would bamboozle their way to a few goal  <BRK>

  <BRK>but the beefy bayern boy stood strong  what they lacked in agility and fleet footedness  they made up with timing  intelligence  persistence  and power  rather than getting into foot race with their opponent  they often covered wonderfully for one another when one wa beaten  if mane got past kimmich  süle wa there to sweep the ball away  when süle wa beaten  kimmich and hummels closed down the space  and hummels stood his ground often by muscling away attacker when they tried to run beyond him  when all else failed  they   especially süle   threw their body in the way  trusting they were wide and tall enough to block any space for a shot  and it worked  <BRK>the game wa a display of opposing definition of athleticism  and while liverpool s build seemed like it should dominate a fast paced game  the beefy bayern boy combined their physicality with intelligence to counter their opponent perfectly  <BRK>keita ha been looking more comfortable and confident in midfield after a rough start to his anfield career  wijnaldum is well known a a critical quality to this liverpool team  even if he s still a bit underrated  they re two different type of player  but something i love about both is their dribbling ability and how it unnerves defender  <BRK>in the second minute of the game  alisson drove the ball to wijnaldum in the center of the field  right under the halfway line  to bypas the bayern press  wijnaldum controlled it and turned upfield  and immediately martinez wa by his side  grabbing and trying to take the ball  wijnaldum ran to the right  and when martinez followed  he chopped the ball back behind himself  turning to go left a his defender tried to regain his balance  martinez wa clearly beaten and had no choice but to foul wijnaldum <BRK>in the first half when keita wa at his best  he wa taking player on  even beating a few of them with step over <BRK>slick skill by naby keita  livfcb pic twitter com jasdmvalai<BRK>one of the earliest lesson that midfielders learn is to keep thing simple  losing the ball in the center of the field by trying to do too much is an almost unforgivable sin  but wijnaldum and keita at their best are example of why the ability to dribble in midfield is a terror to defender  when they beat a defender one on one or break pressure by turning away a defender  it creates a numerical and space advantage that allows their teammate to concentrate on making run behind the defensive line  so many of liverpool s chance and best attack came from one of those two turning or dribbling past a defender and forcing the defensive line to panic and retreat  <BRK>i love kimmich  he is such an intelligent and brave player  there were two instance for me when he showed just how incredible he is defensively  <BRK>

  <BRK>in the  nd minute  mane dropped deep in the middle of the field to receive a high pas from salah  süle beat mane to the ball and headed it away  unfortunately for süle  the ball fell to keita just a few yard away and the liverpool midfielder started bringing the ball forward  this meant that süle s position wa compromised  mane wa running into the space  down the middle  that süle had vacated  there wa a small window of time when keita could have played in mane  but he hesitated and soon kimmich and hummels had squeezed in from opposite side of mane to cut off the pas  <BRK>so instead  keita waited until andrew robertson made a run down the left side  right before keita pased the ball into space for robertson  kimmich   who wa running with his body turned sideways  and with his back facing robertson   turned his hip to square up with keita  when keita played the ball to robertson  all kimmich had to do wa slide sideways to close him down  and a soon a robertson took his first touch on the ball  kimmich jumped into his path and poked the ball away  <BRK>then there wa the tackle that kimmich made on mane while playing on a yellow card a few minute later  wijnaldum had sent in a lofted pa to mane on the left side of the box  mane controlled the ball with his right thigh  and a the ball landed near his left foot  mane hesitated to take a touch because kimmich had eraed the small space mane had to operate  in that moment of hesitation  kimmich slid in and got the ball away  <BRK>for reaction from bayern munich fan<BRK>both tackle were in the box  and they were dangerous to attempt  but kimmich wa not only correct in his calculation  but he had set the condition that made it easier for him to take that risk  by swiveling his hip or decreasing space to make an attacker think before making a move  kimmich forced his opponent into trap of his own making  <BRK>throughout the game  he constantly did small thing that made it easier for him to win challenge  and funnel liverpool attacker in dead end  <BRK>towards the end of the  th minute  henderson got the ball a shade over the halfway line  looked up  and sent in a long ball that found salah racing between süle and kimmich  the ball hit salah in stride  behind both defender and right in front of goalkeeper manuel neuer  salah stretched out his leg to touch the ball towards goal  but neuer wa able to save it comfortably  <BRK> skip ahead to the   second mark  <BRK>goalkeeper owned today s champion league match   watch the  ucl on  brlive  http   t co l inkxcxnq pic twitter com  s gvgslh<BRK>i ve often joked that henderson s best quality are looking very english and walking around with his chest out  but against bayern  he wa tremendous  he covered the whole field  bailed out his teammate when they made mistake  and won the ball back to kickstart liverpool attack many time  <BRK>henderson wa impressive throughout the game  and i wa pleasantly surprised and awed by his long ball to salah  so while i will give henderson reprieve for a few week because of the quality of that ball  i don t think it s too farfetched to say that salah is just an off brand carlos vela  <BRK>for more on mo salah and company<BRK>i always like seeing the player  pregame ritual  it s fun to see what thing people do to instill some order in our chaotic reality  or at least  to calm their nerve and make themselves comfortable within that chaos  soccer is nerve wrecking  even before the ball is kicked  there s an excitement and nervousness leading up to the game  an anxiety that could potentially overwhelm a player and cause them to have a terrible game <BRK>most people who play the game  no matter how good they are  have small ritual that they perform in order to prepare themselves for   minute of pushing their mental and physical capability  some of the ritual are elaborate  like tim howard s  and others are a simple a player hopping on one leg while entering the field  <BRK>prayer before game is facinating to me because of the humility involved in it  before the game  salah stood near the center circle and prayed with his hand before his face  a he usually doe  then wiped his face with his hand afterwards  while standing in his goal  alisson had his eye closed  with the index finger on both hand pointing to the sky a he prayed  prayer is an asertion by those who perform it  that there are other power  greater power  at work  or at leat present  when the stage wa set for human and bodily excellence  salah and alisson  each in his own way towards his own faith  chose to appeal to something beyond themselves and their teammate <BRK>
