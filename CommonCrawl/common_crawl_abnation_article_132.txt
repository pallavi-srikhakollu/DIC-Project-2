the los angeles ram were the story of the   offseason  <BRK> led by a second year quarterback  jared goff   a third year running back  todd gurley   and a head coach younger than some of his player  sean mcvay   this re re located franchise rode an offensive surge from     to     last season  and they spent most of this offseason acquiring every big defensive name they could to complement best in the league tackle aaron donald while somehow skirting the salary cap  ndamukong suh came from miami  marcus peter came from kansa city  aqib talib came from denver  dante fowler jr  came from jacksonville midseason  <BRK> this wa a much of an all in strategy a we ve seen in the cap era  knowing they had only a small window to take advantage of goff s rookie contract and surround him with a flood of talent before contract had to start getting offloaded   they had two year at most  really   they went for it  <BRK> the gambit more or le paid off in    even though the defense never completely came together  slowed down by injury and big play issue in the secondary  los angeles finished      tied for the best record in the league  they are one win from the super bowl  <BRK> their main problem  the saint also went      and because of a     win over los angeles on november    they re hosting the nfc championship  they are a half touchdown favorite over the ram   nearly the margin of the home field advantage they earned two and a half month ago   and they are one of only a couple of team that are arguably better than mcvay s team at the moment  according to fivethirtyeight  the ram have the lowest odds among the four remaining team of winning the super bowl  <BRK> going all in and giving yourself a fixed window of time to win a title is both exciting and terrifying  even if everything work out a you want it to  you still have to win a single elimination tournament at the end of the year  you re still a flip of the coin from watching your plan fail  <BRK> eighty five percent  that would be a pretty good catch rate for a running back who catch a lot of checkdowns and flare pass  it would be unheard of for a wide receiver  <BRK> the   nfl wideouts targeted at least   time combined for a more than respectable   percent catch rate  and only seven topped   percent  but there s michael thomas  catching   of   pass  eight five percent of them  for the season  <BRK> thomas is emblematic of new orleans  offense  absurdly efficient  if slightly le explosive than some of it peer  of those   target wideouts  only six averaged fewer yard per catch than thomas       and of the most efficient passing attack in the league  only atlanta wa le explosive  but if you can t figure out how to rush quarterback drew brees  you ll die via     paper cut  <BRK> the ram know this a well a anyone  in new orleans  november win over los angeles  thoma wa officially targeted   time  of the first   target  only one wa thrown further than   yard from the line of scrimmage  he caught   short pases for   yard over the first three and a half quarter  and then  with the game tied at      he went deep over the middle to set up a field goal  then caught a bomb  well  the saint  version of a bomb  down the left sideline for the game clinching touchdown  <BRK> new orleans  output against the ram wa the perfect combination of the saint  efficiency  first in passing marginal efficiency  and the ram  big play leakiness  third worst in passing marginal explosiveness   nick them until they get desperate  then gash them  <BRK> if you re los angeles  you have to feel good about the fact that  with talib on the sideline and thomas playing incredibly well  you were still tied midway through the fourth quarter  that you hurried brees only four time in   pass and never sacked him  however  ha to make you feel     le good  <BRK> in the new orleans offense  basically three guy touch the ball  thomas and running back alvin kamara and mark ingram  of the saint    combined regular season carry and target  this trio had   of them  the ram contained kamara and ingram  combined    intended touch for   yard  only     per it  and could do so again on sunday afternoon  but they had no idea how to stop brees to thomas  now they get another chance  <BRK> the ram were indeed without talib against the saint  but they were also with receiver cooper kupp  who would tear his acl a week later  new orleans did a phenomenal job of limiting gurley s output    intended touch    yard  that the ram needed thomasian combined production from kupp and brandin cook    target    catch    yard  to catch up after falling behind early  <BRK> the ram scored   point on the chief the week after kupp s injury  but their production slowed briefly from there  after averaging   point and   yard per game through   contest  they averaged   and    respectively  while losing two of their next three game  so with the passing game slightly hamstrung  they redoubled their rushing effort  <BRK> through   game  the ram had rushed for more than   yard three time  they ve now done so in each of their last three game  they straight up mauled a good cowboy defense a week ago  with gurley and bowling ball journeyman c j  anderson combining for   yard on   carry  <BRK> not only did los angeles sign anderson in mid december  after he had been cut by carolina and oakland  but they ve put him to work  he s carried   time for   yard in his three game in a ram uniform  while stopping gurley ha been an obvious key for beating los angeles   he averaged   yard per intended touch in win and only     in loss this season   anderson s emergence ha potentially changed the equation a bit  especially combined with some dominance up front  <BRK> we ll see what that mean against the saint  per dvoa  new orleans wa one of the only defense in the league that defended the run better than dallas  the saint ranked sixth in rushing efficiency and first in rushing explosiveness   they aren t the most disruptive defense in the league  but linebacker demario davis and a j  klein and safety vonn bell don t miss tackle  <BRK> without defensive tackle sheldon rankin  who tore his achilles early in last week s win over philadelphia  the saint could be a bit more vulnerable up front  they weren t against the eagle  mind you   philly s wendell smallwood and darren sproles gained just   yard in nine carry after rankin  injury  but with gurley refreshed and anderson doing a great short jerome bettis impersonation  the ram will test new orleans  front significantly  <BRK> special team didn t play a huge role in this year s first saint ram game   there were only three punt  after all  but greg zuerlein did miss a long second quarter field goal that could have come in handy later on  and immortal new orleans punter thoma morstead did down the ram inside their   twice   it didn t matter  a los angeles turned those two point into   point  but still   <BRK> new orleans ha easily had the better special team unit here  especially in the two way that matter most  punting and place kicking  if special team actually do play more of a role this time around  that probably favor the home team  <BRK> not including their brees le  meaningle week   loss to carolina  new orleans ha scored at least   point in every home game this year and ha scored at least   point six of eight time  <BRK> the saint  defense  however  ha been quite a bit more volatile  which ha made them one of the more unpredictable team in the league against the spread  they gave up a combined   point in two home win over philadelphia  and they held an efficient atlanta offense to   point on thanksgiving  but they also gave up   point to tampa bay in week    plus   to the ram and   to the steelers  <BRK> granted  that tampa game wa a long time ago  but from the perspective of spread performance  new orleans ha been far more up and down  despite the reasonably tight vega line  both a   point saint win and a   point saint loss are on the table  <BRK> brees just turned   year old and is two win from his second super bowl ring  which would be a many a peyton manning and ben roethlisberger  more than aaron rodgers  etc  his   percent completion rate in   wa the highest of his career  and this probably isn t his lat shot at said second ring  but it might be his best shot  <BRK> meanwhile  though other franchise usually wait until you actually win the super bowl to begin imitating you like crazy  we re already seeing the mcvay effect emanating throughout the league  just imagine how other team might attempt to copycat mcvay s offensive leaning  especially after he engineered a late season shift in those leaning  <BRK> imagine  too  what might happen around the league if the ram  all in for a ring maneuvering actually produce a ring  we talked all offseason about their bold move  now we find out if they pay off  <BRK> if rankin  injury turn out costly  and if the ram are no more capable of slowing thomas with talib than they were without him  then this game could cross the same   point threshold that the first battle did  but we ll say both team are a little more cautious  and both defense slow the run game enough to force enough third and longs to keep the point total tamped down this time  <BRK> new orleans  volatility open up the possibility of a double digit win for either team  but it s hard to envision anything other than a super tight  fun a hell contest  the first one certainly wa  even if the saint scored a late round knockout  <BRK>
