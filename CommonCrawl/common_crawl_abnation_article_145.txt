going into selection sunday  auburn had already been identified by kansa fan a a potential   seed this team wanted no part of  the tiger make it rain from downtown and force a ton of turnover  making them a combination of trait the jayhawks struggled with all year  unfortunately  this game played out exactly a fan feared <BRK>auburn came out firing  and hit six of ten from behind the line in just the first ten minute of the game  in that same span  kansa turned it over four time without forcing any of their own   the result wa ku getting buried  down     with nine minute still remaining in the first half  dedric lawson wa a scoreless     at that point  and kansa simply had no answer for a team that seemed ideally constructed to make them look bad  <BRK>at the half it wa basically worst case scenario  auburn led     and had shot     from deep while forcing eight turnover  kansa wa just     from behind the arc  lawson had four point  all from the free throw line  after going      marcus garrett actually led the team in scoring with seven  even if this weren t a matchup nightmare for the jayhawks  this year s team simply isn t built for large comeback <BRK>the second half wan t much different  and there wa never really any feeling that kansa might be able to mount a comeback  in fact  had they been so inclined  auburn could have hit triple digit  instead they opted to cruise a bit down the stretch  ending with a resounding     victory <BRK>there isn t a whole lot to point out in term of positive  lawson still had his customary double double  ending with   point and   board after scoring some garbage time bucket  devon dotson ended an impressive freshman campaign with   point  three assist and two steal <BRK>the jayhawks ended the season with ten loss for just the second time in bill self s tenure  the main question this offseason is just a matter of who will be back next year  since vick never returned to the team  every player currently on the roster could theoretically return  lawson and udoka azubuike could potentially test the professional water  but it would be unlikely for any of their teammate to do so <BRK>that s a wrap for     jayhawks  it wa a frustrating season  but it s comforting to know that a   seed and     season ending in the round of   is what s considered a rough down year in lawrence <BRK>rock chalk<BRK>
