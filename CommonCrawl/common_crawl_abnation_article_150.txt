the state of labor relation in major league baseball is tenuous at best these day  we have seen player become increasingly vocal about their displeasure regarding the  broken process  of free agency this winter  including high profile veteran like adam wainwright and justin verlander  but while the  like minded  thinking across front office that ha driven down free agent spending the past two year ha incensed almost every player who speaks up about the subject  the tactic used by executive have indeed helped to accomplish their goal in the short term   lower overall salary and convince player to become more willing to negotiate team friendly extension rather than face the uncertainty of free agency  <BRK> with many player starting to sign extension in uncertain mlb economic system   brewer  b travis shaw said he is open to overture from the club  shaw  whose salary jumped to      m in  st year of arbitration  said there have been no talk yet  <BRK> travis shaw recently expressed his interest in signing a long term deal with the milwaukee brewer  hoping to join the recent spate of player who have inked extension with their current employer  shaw ha spent the past two season suiting up for the cream city nine following a trade from boston and ha broken out to become one of the top third baseman on the senior circuit  compiling a          slash in     plate appearance    ops   with   homer    run batted in  and   stolen base across   game  he wa also a finalist for a gold glove at the hot corner in    baseball reference value shaw s contribution at     win above replacement since the start of    <BRK> here is what shaw had to say about his future in milwaukee  per adam mccalvy  <BRK>  you can t blame guy for doing it   aaron  nola is worth more than what he signed for  but i can t blame him  i would probably take the same thing  guy are starting to grab some money now while they can  and nobody can fault them  people are saying they re taking  team friendly  deal  but are they really team friendly deal when they re getting to free agency and they re not even getting that   <BRK>  i m open for discussion  i like it here  i ve had some success here  we had a good group of guy here and i ve enjoyed it  i would like to be here long term   <BRK> shaw s situation is somewhat unique when it come to profiling him a an extension candidate  he received only a   k signing bonus upon signing a a ninth round pick of the red sox and though he signed for one year and      mil covering the   seaon  he ha yet to truly lock in that  lifetime of financial security  that player who agree to such extension are typically seeking  a late bloomer in term of mlb success  shaw will play this seaon at age   and won t be eligible for free agency until after   seaon  at which point he ll be entering his age   seaon  that could have him feeling some added pressure to secure some guaranteed money right now  especially with a wife and young daughter who ha battled serious health problem to think about at home  <BRK> there aren t many clean comparison in term of age and service time when looking back at pat extension  there have been several player in the     year service clas who have signed big money extension  including the like of freddy freeman  elvis andrus  eugenio suarez  and our own ryan braun  but all those player were either much younger  much more accomplished  or both when they agreed to their long term deal  alexei ramirez wa both the same age     and in the same service clas  between     year  a shaw now when he signed his four year       mil extension back in    but that wa eight year ago  and ramirez wa a shortstop and had already secured quite a bit of money when he signed a an international free agent from cuba in    <BRK> so  we ll have to go about thing differently when building a hypothetical shaw extension  if he wa to simply continue through the arbitration process for two more season while producing at a similar level on the field  one would figure that he should earn somewhere in the range of      mil combined during the   and   season when building off of his      mil base in arb year one  the brewer would obviously want him to give up some of that earning potential in exchange for guaranteed security  but because of shaw s age  they probably wouldn t want to buy out too many of his free agent year  either  <BRK> perhaps something like a three year     mil deal with a club option for the fourth season could work out for both side  in this scenario  he would play out   at his already agreed upon rate  then earn salary of    mil in   and    mil in   covering his final two year of arbitration followed by a    mil base in   during what would be his first year of free agent eligibility  the fourth year could be a club option for    shaw s age   season  at another      mil or so along with a    mil buyout  <BRK> a deal along these line would offer shaw the financial security that he seems to desire  and if he s able to continue producing at a level similar to the last two season  it would give milwaukee another three to four year of a well above average player at relative bargain price and solidify the third base spot within the current contention window  <BRK> it worth noting that there are presently no talk that are known to be occurring between the player s camp and the brewer at present  and there ha not been any real indication that the front office is interested in locking up travis shaw at this time  but he is a talented third baseman who is popular with the fan base and he appears to be open to give the brewer a deal  if they are willing to talk  there is still plenty of time for the two side to hah out an agreement before the regular season begin  and that s probably something that david stearns and company should begin to seriously consider  <BRK> statistic courtesy of baseball reference <BRK>
