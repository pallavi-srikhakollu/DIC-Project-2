welp  steve spurrier s aaf team now ha to practice in the home state of one of his biggest rival  the orlando apollo  who play their home game at ucf s spectrum stadium  will now have to practice in georgia thanks to florida s worker  compensation law <BRK>the issue lie with the fact that florida doesn t categorize professional athlete a employee and won t secure insurance coverage for them    and that the aaf han t been able to secure private coverage on it own  via the orlando sentinel   <BRK>aaf official say the reaon this is even an issue is because florida  unlike many other state  will not cover professional athlete under it worker compensation law  in florida  professional athlete are not categorized a employee  which mean state law prevents pro athlete from filing worker comp claim for injury incurred while on the job <BRK>according to aaf official  other more established professional league who have team in the state   such a the nfl  nba  nhl and major league baeball   have all managed to find insurance company that will insure their entire league  the aaf  because it is start up league in the perilously dangerous sport of football  ha been unable to locate a company that will insure all eight team in the league  <BRK>so the apollo are off to georgia  where they ll have worker  comp coverage  aaf player in florida not being able to file worker  comp is odd in itself  but it get even weirder  <BRK>per the sentinel  the apollo will stay in a hotel jacksonville and take bus   minute north to kingsland  georgia  where they ll have their practice  yeesh  <BRK>it s not unheard of for a team s practice facility to be far away from where it home game are played  in the nfl  washington play home game in maryland  near d c   and practice an hour away in virginia  but long team bus ride to practice every day is a new one  <BRK>since the apollo won t have to practice exclusively in georgia all seaon  more on that in a minute   the team will bus back to orlando for the one home game on march   against the arizona hotshot  speaking a a   native  that drive isn t terrible  but it s certainly harder than already being in orlando in the first place  <BRK>in    the head ball coach spoke with steven godfrey about    but it really turned into him ragging on georgia  <BRK>i don t ever hear much from georgia fan now  most football fan  if coach have success where they re at  generally if you re not coaching against their team  they re ok with you  it s sort of interesting  looking back <BRK>and when he wa at south carolina  he had this glorious one liner about playing the dawgs early in the season <BRK> i sort of always liked playing them that second game because you could always count on them having two or three key player suspended   spurrier told espn s chris low back in   <BRK>spurrier ha continued to roast old college rival well into retirement  <BRK>i  for one  am shocked this didn t work  apparently the hbc couldn t get through to the state s insurance commissioner  per the sentinel  <BRK>so the team will spend   day out of it   day season practicing in georgia  the sentinel say  with that one bus trip to orlando for a home game mixed in  not exactly ideal  but certainly better than having to bus to kingsland the whole rest of the season  <BRK>no new football league is going to come without hiccup  but the apollo are undefeated with clearly the most popular coach in the league  they have the most former blue chip recruit of any of the league s eight team  and now they re wandering <BRK>
