rumor will be plentiful in the coming week with the nba trade deadline le than a month away  but a new report saying the dallas maverick and new york knicks have discussed a deal that would include respective   lottery pick dennis smith jr  and frank ntilikina is suspect  and the knicks shouldn t consider such a swap anyway <BRK>knicks fan scrolling twitter earlier this week were treated to a report from verified tweeter brandon robinson  claiming the knicks and maverick have talked about a trade that would see the knicks saying farewell to ntilikina and tim hardaway jr  while bringing back smith jr  and wes matthew <BRK>dennis smith jr  trade rumor  knicks and mavs have discussed a smith jr  and wes matthew swap in exchange for tim hardaway  jr    frank ntilikina  pic twitter com sgvuzpsk y<BRK>although twitter wa abuzz in the wake of the report and a few outlet aggregated the rumor  robinson  whose report wa posted on heavy com  ha previous experience putting out a splashy bit of supposed news that turned out to have no leg  over the summer  he reported that kobe bryant would play in the big     the   on   basketball league that wa founded by ice cube and feature former pro ballers   only to be rebuked by the like of espn s ramona shelburne and the associated press s brian mahoney  the latter of which reported that the chief marketing officer of kobe inc  said bryant  definitely is not playing next year   <BRK>forget that kobe to the  big  idea  molly carter  chief marketing officer of kobe inc   say he definitely is not playing next year <BRK> it s no secret that the maverick are interested in offloading smith jr   who wa drafted  th overall in   but ha struggled to find his way in an offense being spectacularly run by rookie luka doncic  espn s adrian wojnarowski and tim macmahon recently co penned a story stating that the maverick are  escalating talk  to deal the   year old       guard  and cited league source a saying the phoenix sun and orlando magic  have been active in talk with the maverick  about a trade  the report also said the mavs have been seeking deal that would include matthew  a   year nba veteran who is in the lat year of his contract but is due      million this seaon <BRK>the dallas maverick are escalating discussion to find a trade for point guard dennis smith jr   league source tell espn  phoenix and orlando have engaged in ongoing talk with mavs  smith jr   ha sat out three straight game with what team ha termed a sore back <BRK>curiously  while the knicks have been linked to the mavs a possible trading partner  espn and other well known outlet have not suggested that ntilikina is necessarily on the chopping block  although it s eay to see why the idea of a deal involving ntilikina and smith jr  make for a juicy story  ntilikina wa drafted one spot ahead of smith jr  in    and lebron james once caused a slight dustup when he clumsily attempted to take a shot at former knickerbockers team president phil jackson by saying the knicks  pased on a really good one  and noting that smith jr   should be a knick  <BRK>regardless of whether there s any truth to the a of now unverified rumor  the deal being bandied about is not a trade the knicks should make  smith jr  ha showed some promise in his one and a half seaons a a pro  and his ability to explode towards the hoop for dunk is something to behold  but ntilikina ha already proven that he pair perfectly with kristaps porzingis  and his ridiculous length  defensive prowess and overall team first mindset is what the knicks of the future need <BRK>there s no question that ntilikina ha struggled to score consistently during a sophomore seaon that ha been cause for frustration  but a fivethirtyeight s chris herring wrote in october    ntilikina  may be the pro baketball version of benjamin button  a player whose skill age and develop in reverse  with defensive matery coming before offensive   <BRK>ntilikina    year old  is three inch taller than smith jr   and his      wingspan reach far further than the      that smith jr  s arm can reach  further  the knicks knew they were getting a project when they drafted ntilikina  and once again  there is already evidence that ntilikina plus porzingis is a match made in basketball heaven  heck  the new york daily news reported about a month ago that porzingis wa  among a small group of player last season who asked jeff hornacek to start ntilikina at point guard   which doen t definitively prove that porzingis think ntilikina should be off limit but doe suggest that he is fond of frank <BRK>a for the question of whether trading ntilikina might be worth it in order to get hardaway jr  s contract off the book  shedding the shooting guard is simply not a necessary enough tak to justify giving up on frank  hardaway jr  ha two year left on his contract after this year  and he get paid a hefty sum  almost    million in the final year of his deal   so the argument is that the knicks would have an eaier time finding room to sign superstar without him  <BRK>it would be nice to sign a superstar in free agency  but it s more important that the knicks continue to focus on building a team in the proper way  the knicks already have one superstar in recovery in porzingis   at   year old  kevin knox just became the sixth youngest player in nba history to score at least   point in a single game  and the team is so bad this season that they are guaranteed a high pick in the upcoming nba draft  now is not the time to panic and trade ntilikina just to free up some cap space <BRK>meanwhile  at the moment the knicks only have eight player under contract for next season  meaning there are way to carve out space beyond trading a   year old who ha averaged almost   point per game this season while handling more of the offensive load than he should have to <BRK>there are scenario where trading hardaway jr  could be a positive  but this rumored trade isn t one of them  the knicks need guy that  around porzingis  can coalesce into a great team  frank fit the mold <BRK>
