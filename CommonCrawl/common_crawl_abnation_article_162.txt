bracket seeding is the least exciting part of the ncaa tournament for a lot of viewer  it sometimes feel arbitrary  yet also requires understanding any number of unintuitive acronym and statistic <BRK>but bracket seeding is hugely important  especially in the woman s tournament now that the same no    seed can no longer be counted on to go the final four every year  <BRK>woman s college baketball ha long been dominated by a few team  uconn  baylor  tennessee  because it is still young relative to the men s game  and the infratructure required to develop enough really strong player to form   team of near equal ability is still under construction  because of that  the likelihood of upset is fairly low in the woman s tournament   and a anyone who s done a perfunctory office pool is aware  upset are the bread and butter of win or go home march madness <BRK>

  <BRK>that s changing  though  slowly but surely  and a the depth in woman s college baketball get better  the ncaa tournament need to start paying better attention to how it place team  especially regionally <BRK>the conversation about how to better foster parity in the woman s game wa sparked anew by the preliminary ncaa woman s tournament bracket release monday  which ha inspired some chagrin among woman s basketball analyst <BRK>pic twitter com t jlat rvv<BRK>if you have not been immersed in woman s college basketball ranking  the short version is that team currently slated to play in chicago and  particularly  greensboro have a much tougher path to the final four  in this release  greensboro s overall seeding is considerably lower  the sum of the team  true seed is    than albany s  which is     a higher seed total mean there are more lower ranked team in the region   which mean an easier route to the final four for the higher seed  it s important to note that this seeding is not definitive  and might change following the end of regular season and conference tournament play  but the worry is that an unbalanced regional bracket could make for a le competitive final four <BRK>on the men s side  the top   team are all  in theory  strong enough that all four regional pod will be almost equally competitive  regardless of how the team are placed  on the woman s side  there s a more pronounced gap between the ability of an overall   seed and an overall   seed  depending on the way the regionals are assigned   which is not just based on pure seeding  but also geography and avoiding in conference competition   a top seeded team in one region can have a considerably better chance of making it to the final four than a top seeded team in another region <BRK>the committee wind up prioritizing geography because the support for woman s college baketball team is still growing  and making game a accessible a possible is a way to make sure people are actually there  but with more team than ever who can compete at a high level   the top six team in the ap poll have been reshuffling themselves all seaon   the ncaa need to prioritize giving team that haven t won in the pat the best possible shot to take home the chip over making life eay for fan of more established team  <BRK>espn analyst  and let s face it  hero  debbie antonelli ha been campaigning for a single site sweet sixteen in la vega for a number of year  that way  team could be seeded based on their ability and record alone   parity is what we asked for  and now we have to manage it with a format change to grow the game   she tweeted on tuesday   we don t want to seed with the  g curve    geography curve  we want an  s curve   earned seeding  <BRK>the biggest game of the week did wind up becoming a classic example of uconn doing uconn thing   but only in the second half  south carolina got out to a quick lead  making their first   of   shot  and the two team went into the locker room at halftime just one point apart <BRK>the husky exploded in the third quarter to earn a grim looking  yet symmetrical      win  napheesa collier s had a   point and   rebound performance  which had coach geno auriemma doing some light naismith and wooden award campaigning after the game   there can t be a player who s playing better or doing more for their team than napheesa collier   auriemma said   there s something about her that s just rare   you just don t see it  you don t see it at all  <BRK>the gaudy score aside  the fact that team have been able to challenge uconn   even just for a couple of quarter   might turn out to be a double edged sword  <BRK>yes  there is to some degree a blueprint now for how to beat uconn  that doesn t mean that blueprint is easy  <BRK> i said that before the seaon   we can t guard anybody  we have to make a lot of shot   auriemma said   if we have a bad shooting night  we re going to lose   that sentiment wa echoed in collier s postgame scrum   a coach ha pointed out  we re not the best defensive team   <BRK>for south carolina coach dawn staley  the answer to capitalizing on uconn s  weak  defense  which held her team to      shooting in the second half  lie in the paint  <BRK> you gotta drive on uconn   staley said after the game   you gotta run them back on their heel  and expect not to get many foul called   you just gotta play through physical contact  you gotta play through attacking the paint  obviously  with uconn  there are some shortcoming when it come to defending   their defense ha layer  but you can get inside  if you have an imposing post player  they would have some difficulty matching up  we just couldn t make that connection with our big tonight  <BRK>the flip side of the blueprint to beat uconn is that uconn also ha the blueprint to beating uconn   and  after two high stake loss  experience with being challenged and fighting back  <BRK> we have some deficiency  and team can exploit that   auriemma said after the game   obviously team with great size  we can t do anything about that  team that can score from a lot of different position  we re going to struggle with that   again  unless we make shot  <BRK> there are a couple team out there that becaue of what they have  we can t handle them  and that never ued to be the case   he continued   i always felt like whatever they had  we had an answer for it and this is jut not one of those year  but maybe it s good that we re going through these moment when we have to try to figure out how to guard three guard that are way quicker than our guard  guard team that are jut a lot bigger or more physical than u  the more we learn about it  the better we ll be come march  <BRK>collier echoed that sentiment   a weird a it sound  it feel better to know that we know we can stay composed if we re losing  or if we re in a high pressure situation like that   the senior said after the game   we hadn t experienced that until our lat couple game in pat few year  we know what to do in those situation now  it s not like we re going through it for the first time  <BRK>from february      <BRK>from
