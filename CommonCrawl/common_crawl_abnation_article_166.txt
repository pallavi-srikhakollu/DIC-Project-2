the season might be over  but that doesn t mean we don t discus the nfl  there s a ridiculous amount of nfl offseason storyline to follow  and i want to share my thought on all of them   <BRK> let s start with player movement now that we ve had our first trade of the   offseason  <BRK> the first trade of   wa a shocker  joe flacco wa traded to the denver bronco for a mid round pick  remember  this is a bronco team that just shelled out money to case keenum  keenum is guaranteed    million in   in the final year of his two year     million contract  if the bronco can t move him  which will be tough at that salary  they have to eat that money  no bueno   <BRK> the bronco  plan is clear  they are building a team that s going to resemble the   super bowl winner  defense  rushing the ball  and timely passing   <BRK> a i covered lat week  you need offense to get into the dance  trading for flacco is not enough offense to win  this move make no sense  however  i do expect the bronco to still take a quarterback high in the draft to eventually be the top dog when flacco is finished   <BRK> the steelers have two big decision to make this offseason  let s start with antonio brown  an elite weapon who s a five time all pro  since    he ha averaged     yard and   touchdown per season while battling through double team   <BRK> brown said goodbye to steelers fan on social medium recently even though he s still on the roster  he clearly want a trade out of pittsburgh  but i m not sure the steelers are going to listen to his plea  the steelers are an old school organization that doesn t get manipulated by these sort of demand  e g  le veon bell  if they believe brown can help their team  which of course he can  then i think they will attempt to patch thing up   <BRK> however  principle be damned if someone offer a first round pick in the package for brown  i m skeptical team will trade high value pick for a   year old receiver with a monster contract and history of diva behavior  if that s the case  the steelers have to move brown  they d clear his combined    million off their cap in   and    but would still have to take a    million hit in    and get rid of a headache with an eye toward the future in draft pick   <BRK> so who make the trade for brown  the raider  duh  this just feel like a raider  play  they can make a splah move in the middle of bad press   they still don t have a place to play next seaon   and also get fan excited for the move to vega  the offshores list the  er a the favorite  for whatever it s worth   <BRK> but the raider have the ammo with draft pick  and they need weapon so badly to help derek carr or whoever is playing quarterback  from just a football angle  brown would do fantastic in a west coast offense  they d find way to get him in space without double team and can use his ability to fly   <BRK> if you want an outside the box location  look at the super bowl champion  the patriot have multiple pick within the first   slot and they could use brown  the culture in new england should be a good fit for brown  too  i wouldn t rule that out  even if the steelers have claimed he wouldn t be traded to new england  <BRK> while the steelers are figuring out how to handle the brown situation  they have another player dispute to tackle a well  bell want out  he should get his wish   <BRK> bell received the franchise tag last season and chose to sit out the season to preserve his body for    there are report the steelers might be petty and use the transition tag to gain some trade leverage for bell  i hope they don t do it and just let him walk   <BRK>

   <BRK> so where doe bell end up  <BRK> there are team with cap room that could use a dynamic playmaker like bell  including the jet  colt  and texan  however  a wa the holdup in pittsburgh  bell want to get paid  super duper paid  bell want to be paid a a hybrid player   a runner and a pas catcher   <BRK> well  no team should pay him a such  i m probably on the more extreme side here  but i don t think there s much point paying a running back big buck  they don t prove to be that valuable to winning when you can draft a back in a later round or even  a phillip lindsay showed u  a an undrafted free agent  but team have money and they need to spend it  so bell will get a deal at a rate jut above todd gurley   <BRK> i think those team i mentioned above are most likely the option for bell  with the jet being the favorite  the jet badly need some offensive weapon for sam darnold  and they have the money to overpay for bell  the  er and bell would be a perfect match scheme wise if the  er wanted to add bell  his market will be hot  <BRK> nick foles is out a an eagle  i don t think we will ever appreciate what foles did over the lat two seaons  foles is a backup quarterback who won super bowl mvp honor  his eagle won all three of their elimination game in    then lat seaon the eagle won their final three regular seaon game  all must win  they went into chicago a the sixth seed and beat the bear in the playoff  so foles wa     in elimination game over two seaons before losing to the saint in the divisional round   <BRK> but  with carson wentz back healthy to start    it s time to move on from foles  the eagle could franchise tag foles in an effort to gain some capital back for him  i expect team to offer no better than one second round pick in this draft for foles  with maybe a late round pick thrown into the trade to sweeten the deal   <BRK> the logical place for foles to end up is jacksonville  blake bortles is finished and with the jaguar  defense  they just need average from any quarterback to have success  if the dolphin choose to move on from ryan tannehill  that seems like a decent team for him   <BRK> there just aren t a ton of landing spot  most team have franchise quarterback or have young quarterback on their roster  so foles will have slim picking   <BRK> lastly  philadelphia wa a perfect storm for foles  outstanding coaching  an offense tailored to his strong suit  a great offensive line  and above average weapon to target  i just don t see him duplicating success elsewhere  <BRK>
