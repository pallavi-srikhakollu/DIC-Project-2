the nba s all star game typically isn t all that memorable  i m sure it s a lovely experience for those actually in attendance  but for the fan at home  it s a semi entertaining night that eventually loses it flair  maybe there s a dunk that s highlighted on monday  but by tuesday we ve moved on forever  what do you even remember from the   game  <BRK>fergie dared to be different during her national anthem performance  and it wa spectacular  inspiring  even  not because it wa good  it wa awful  but she took a risk on a scale few would ever consider going for  an already established  extremely famous celebrity  fergie could have just done the norm  but she had her legacy in mind  and a desire to do something greater <BRK>

  <BRK>the failed anthem ha it place in nba lore  it waged an online war between draymond green and josh duhamel  sparked some genius to make a remix to her anthem and for the warrior to dance a a group to said remix  and made every fan listening to a performance at a sporting event expect something more  something daring  for better or worse <BRK>in case you need a refresher  here s how her national anthem performance went last year <BRK>it featured <BRK>it wa the complete package <BRK>had this night been a one off  maybe we wouldn t be talking about it so much  but a recently a october  the  sexy anthem   a some deemed it  wa brought back to the spotlight <BRK>fergie s ex husband  duhamel  sought an apology from green <BRK>welcome to  nbatwitter josh duhamel   draymondgreen on today s  fairgameonfs  at    pm et  pic twitter com zz p bsklh<BRK>that didn t go over well  <BRK>it s what inspired most of the warrior team to dance to a remix of the song in the locker room and share it on instagram   later  duhamel conceded on twitter and green clarified that he  never meant to disrespect  fergie  <BRK> post game vibe          fergieremixchallenge  thissongreallyfiretho  remixgodsuede<BRK>a post shared by  alfonzo mckinnie   _alvo_  on oct      at    pm pdt<BRK>amazingly  this anthem had a second life eight month later  further cementing it significance and willingness to never be forgotten <BRK>fergie embraced the backlash of her bold attempt that went horribly wrong  and even unnecessarily apologized for it a day later  <BRK> i ve always been honored and proud to perform the national anthem and last night i wanted to try something special for the nba  i m a risk taker artistically  but clearly this rendition didn t strike the intended tone  i love this country and honestly tried my best   she said  <BRK>and she isn t wrong  this wa a risk   a damn big one that went all the way wrong   but a memorable one  i look back at fergie s moment and interpret it in two way  in both the basketball sense and the real life sense <BRK>let s start with basketball  fergie s jazzy  sexy anthem wa in many way like the sixer  process   she took a smoldering hot mess of a chance at landing something perfect   like a joel embiid   and instead pulled up at training camp with a darko milicic  and that s a risk someone with the money  wealth and respect fergie ha  never needed to take  but she didn t want to be the middling wahington wizard of pop music  that s admirable <BRK>then there s the real life takeaway here to go outside your comfort zone  take some blow to the face  and wash away the backlash with kindness  this is real here  maybe you won t have a platform the size of fergie s but you will be presented with a similar scenario to fergie s <BRK>will you do merely what s expected  or will you let that bbaaayyaanneeerrr yeehhet wwwwaayyaaayyvve <BRK>
