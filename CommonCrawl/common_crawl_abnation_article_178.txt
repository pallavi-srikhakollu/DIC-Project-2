the tweet wrote themselves   the detroit patriot   <BRK> that s the common reaction to how matt patricia s lion kicked off his second foray into free agency a their head coach  detroit dedicated it first day of free agent wheeling and dealing by reuniting the former new england defensive coordinator with a trio of ex patriot   wide receiver danny amendola  cornerback justin coleman  and pas rusher trey flower   <BRK> the signing work on paper  amendola will be   this season  but he s a reliable third receiver  flower wa one of the league s most underrated defensive linemen before a deluge of thinkpieces about his unknown greatness swung the needle in the opposite direction  but he s still a great player  coleman ha never been a full time starter  but he s a budding young cornerback who can make the most of his opportunity in michigan  all three should help the lion and the coach once plucked from bill belichick s coaching tree  <BRK> but it rarely work that way  <BRK> the patriot way  tm  ha proved untransferable outside of new england  coach like josh mcdaniels and mike vrabel found out paying the player who price themselves out of belichick s circle of trust doesn t lead to improvement  and now lion general manager bob quinn   who wa with the patriot franchise from      and patricia are trying to buck that trend  <BRK> let s start in    josh mcdaniels left his post a the patriot  offensive coordinator for the head coaching job with the bronco  while the biggest move tied to his arrival wa shipping jay cutler to chicago  he also made a handful of move to bring his former charge to denver  wide receiver jabar gaffney  who d earned      million over three year with the patriot  inked a four year     million contract with the bronco  trade for bit player le kevin smith and rus hochstein followed  <BRK> while mcdaniels would race out to a     start that included an overtime win against new england   where gaffney had six catch for   yard   his new player underwhelmed in a     finish that kept the bronco out of the postseason  the following season he traded for former patriot laurence maroney to beef up a tailback rotation led by the inconsistent knowshon moreno  that fall  mcdaniels clashed with his owner and turned in a     record before being fired in december  <BRK> from the top   free agent  to mock draft  to scouting report  we ve got everything you need to get through the offseason  all in one place  <BRK> gaffney turned in two perfectly solid seaon at wideout and wa then traded to wahington  hochstein spent three year a a useful interior lineman who could start game in a pinch  maroney and smith were non factor  with the former lating just four game with denver   <BRK> these player were all fine to disappointing addition who filled gap  but none were able to replicate the team success they d found in new england  this isn t the only time that s happened  <BRK> mike vrabel wa never a patriot assistant coach  but his familiarity with the franchise go back through eight season and   touchdown catch with the team  he inherited a titan club in   that already had a pair of overperforming former patriot in defensive back logan ryan and lineman josh kline  who d helped push tennessee to it first playoff berth in nearly a decade in    vrabel spent big to reward two major pat contributor on the open market last spring  dishing out more than    million in contract to dion lewis and malcolm butler and re signing kline to a    million deal  <BRK> unlike gaffney and hochstein  these name failed to pay off in their first year outside foxborough  butler struggled early in the seaon before making adjustment late and rated out a pro football focus s  th best cornerback  lewis had the worst full seaon of his pro career a his yard per carry average dropped from     to      even kline struggled  vacating his throne a one of the best guard in the league and earning a somewhat surprising releae at the start of the league s new year  <BRK> a a result  a     titan team set to take over the afc south thanks to the jaguar  sudden decline in   went          missing the playoff in the process  tennessee made a concerted effort to shore up some of it glaring weakness by luring two big time competitor to it locker room and got zero improvement in the standing  <BRK> there are other example  too  mark anderson rehabilitated his career with a   sack seaon for the patriot in    he signed a four year       million deal with the bill the following year and recorded one sack over the remainder of his career   which ended in    wes welker couldn t get the cah he wanted from the pat in   so he signed a two year     million deal with the bronco   and gained fewer yard in the final three year of his career than he had in   with new england  patrick chung and legarrette blount each signed lucrative deal with team baed in pennsylvania only to underwhelm and then return to the pat a major contributor to championship team  <BRK> it s not all bad  though  aqib talib turned one year in new england into a return to stardom and a super bowl ring with the bronco  jabaal sheard ha been an understated piece of the colt  ahead of schedule rebuild  akiem hick is a fearsome piece of the bear  front three  <BRK> still  past result don t bode well for a team loading up on former belichick student   especially when playing for a former belichick student   <BRK> patricia is diving back into that void by signing flower  amendola  and to a much lesser extent  coleman  this isn t to say the lion have made bad decision this offseason  they haven t   <BRK> flower is a great young dynamic player who can provide the pa rushing presence patricia thought he d be getting from ziggy ansah lat seaon  amendola should thrive in the gap left behind by marvin jones and kenny golladay  who each should see lighter coverage a a result  coleman improved significantly away from new england  and while he s getting starter money after making only   start in his four year career  he s a rising player who address a distinct need  <BRK> and if throwing money at the player the patriot like but not at a top of the class price were a for sure losing bet  the rest of the league wouldn t be on that same tip  the raider handed a record setting contract at trent brown to get him to protect derek carr s blindside  this may not work out well   cordarrelle patterson s swiss army knife of a season earned him a healthy raise with a two year     million deal with the nfc north champion bear  <BRK> even vrabel s still on that hook  snatching former buccaneer slot receiver adam humphries away from new england s gaze with a four year     million contract the pat were too slow to match  <BRK> there s still plenty of room for the detroit patriot to work out  landing a handful of belichick favorite address some of the team s biggest need at wideout and along the defensive line  adding non new englanders in tight end jesse james and a useful backup interior lineman in oday aboushi will help a well   <BRK> patricia s lion should be better than last year s     version  but history suggests splurging on the guy new england wasn t willing to pay market value for won t lead to the turnaround for which the second year coach is hoping  paying former patriot is no guaranteed solution   and patricia s going to have to coax improvement across the board and not just the area where the lion been willing to spend this offseason to make them a contender in    <BRK>
