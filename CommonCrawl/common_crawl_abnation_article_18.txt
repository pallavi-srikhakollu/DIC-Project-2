<BRK>our countdown begin with a game that wasn t one of the best game of the year but might be the most memorable  with super fan tyler trent in the stand and the no    team in town  the boilermakers put together an all time performance  taking a     lead into the fourth quarter  then throwing on gas <BRK>rondale moore s late catch and run wa maybe the  it s just our night  statement of the year <BRK>again  more memorable than actually good  sure <BRK>but holy crap  alabama lost the title game by   point  clemson owned baically every third down  and bama s big special team risk didn t work out quite a well a the one three year ago  this wa a momentous result  that put it on the list <BRK>by richard johnson<BRK>man   what  a m had this game won  midway through the fourth quarter up    i didn t even pull up the score on my phone while in transit  i figured i d have to write about gu malzahn being in serious trouble <BRK>and then a m didn t  two score in the final      proving auburn jesus wa still in our heart <BRK>uva outgained the yellow jacket by   yard  nearly doubled them in first down  and outscored them by nine in regulation <BRK>but brant mitchell sacked bryce perkins for a safety late  and juanyeh thomas returned the kick for the instant nine point swing  in ot  wesley well  fourth field goal won it <BRK>everybody like a dumb shootout  right  uma star andy isabella scored on reception of   and   yard in the first half  but the minuteman trailed by   midway through the fourth  marquis young s nine yard score with   second left forced overtime  and in the third

another surge could get going <BRK>utep wa mostly helpless in dana dimel s     debut  while north texas went      but any given saturday in el paso  <BRK>the miner scored two fourth quarter touchdown to cut to      then got the ball back with a chance to win in the final three minute  this wa infinitely more of a game than it wa supposed to be <BRK>by morgan moriarty<BRK>kentucky had lost to florida every year since    but the gator went into the fourth trailing      and then thing got even le ordinary <BRK>on the last play  kentucky s defense recovered a fumble and returned it for a touchdown  it wa a wild play that started like this  <BRK>  the perfectly weird conclusion to a   year streak <BRK>a t moved up the hbcu dynasty list this season  winning it third black college title in four year  the aggies also began with a pair of huge win  handling fcs heavyweight jacksonville state  then surviving a weather delayed battle with ecu <BRK>franklin mccain s   yard pick six allowed the aggies to weather an early storm  and elijah bell s touchdown catch in the fourth capped a     run and secured a t s third win over an fbs team in a many year <BRK>any chance david beaty had of saving his job basically went out the window in week    when his record v fcs opponent fell to      ku took a late lead  but lorran fonseca s   yard field goal forced overtime  and chase fourcade s run sealed the deal <BRK>by the end of the first week  we had one of the most pinpoint pass we would see all year in zach bednarczyk s fourth down strike to jarrett mcclenton <BRK>army win close game  and miami  ohio  loses them  but the redhawks attempted to buck trend in the second overtime at west point  it damn near worked <BRK>fau went a disappointing     in lane kiffin s second

scored twice  but fau responded to make it     unt  then deandre torrey ripped off a   yard run <BRK>one  two  three  four  five overtime  early in a     season  sjsu jumped to a     lead on a hawaii that had been smoking hot  hawaii tied at   all early in the fourth quarter  then at      they missed four straight field goal in overtime  then hit three in a row before sjsu missed a   yarder to end this strange war of attrition <BRK>in what turned out to be head coach neal brown s final season  troy beat another storied power conference program  sending scott frost s nebraska to      cedarius rookard s   yard punt return paced a     trojan lead  then b j  smith s   yard run made it      it wa     when nu got the ball back with     left  but on the second play  will sunderland stepped in front of a pas to seal the upset <BRK>the next five are the best non division i game <BRK>d  s wittenberg tiger started     before losing to rival wabash in another top   candidate  which cost a spot in the playoff  instead  denison earned the right to get mauled by mount union in the first round <BRK>two month earlier  wittenberg got the best of denison in a wild  four overtime affair  the tiger bolted to a     lead  but canaan gebele s   yard pas to david weimar made it     with nine minute left  then the big red forced overtime in the final minute  in the fourth ot  wittenberg qb jake kennedy sneaked in for a two pointer that denison couldn t match <BRK>what more can you ask for in a championship game  the naia championship wa a barn burner between morningside of iowa and benedictine of kansa  exploding with three touchdown in the first six minute  it wa     benedictine at halftime  but trent solsma and connor nile connected for an   yard score on the second play of the second half <BRK>benedictine tied with a touchdown and two pointer with     left  the raven got the ball back but suffered disaster  a bad snap on a punt set morningside up in their red zone in

    and keeping heavyweight uw whitewater and mount union mostly at arm s reach in the semi and final <BRK>in the quarterfinal  however  the cru were pushed to their limit  it took one of the best touchdown of the year  <BRK>  and two red zone interception late <BRK>again  what more can you ask of a championship game  to earn vsu s first title in six year  the blazer had to survive a track meet that featured   yard  eight lead change  and one of the wildest catch you ll ever see <BRK>vsu led by    but ferris state kicked a field goal  then scored a touchdown with   second remaining  the blazer foiled the two point pas attempt  champ again <BRK>the best small school game of the year featured snow and the single greatest drive of the season <BRK>down      top ranked mankato embarked on a   play    yard    minute drive to pull within      arguably the new longest in the history of football  running back nate gunn rushed   time for   yard   on  that  drive  on fourth and goal  ryan schlichte hit shane zylstra for the point with     remaining <BRK>twelve minute later  gunn wa rewarded for his work with the winning point  his fiftieth carry went   yard for a score  and the maverick advanced to the d  semifinal <BRK>the best uk seaon since the  s wa nearly even better  despite getting outgained by   yard and moving the chain only eight time in this college station rock fight  the wildcat forced overtime with a   yard darius west fumble return in the final five minute  the magic ran out  a uk s   yard kick hit the crossbar  and trayveon williams scored from   yard out for the win <BRK>ohio became maybe the best team in the mac  but struggled to get rolling  here  they found themselves behind     before nathan rourke hit andrew meyer for a   yard score  then  with   second left  rourke finally put ohio ahead with an eight yard run <BRK>baylor got to a bowl  it s higher on this list  and kansa state didn t  in part because of this wild fourth quarter   the team scored   in the first   minute  then   in the final   <BRK>ksu scored on two long run  then bu tied at     with a   yard pas from charlier brewer to denzel mims  not two minute later  craig williams    yard run put the bear ahead <BRK>ksu needed two minute to even  but baylor sliced back through  ran out the clock  and won on a connor martin field goal with eight second left <BRK>midway through september  it looked like hawaii could surge to   win  the rainbow warrior were     and unstoppable offensively  while army had gotten thumped by duke <BRK>in a style make fight battle  army turned the table with an extremely army performance  at   a m  local time for player traveling from hawaii   the black knight allowed hawaii s explosive  at the time  offense just nine possession and scored on three straight length of the field drive <BRK>hawaii scored on an   yard pas from cole mcdonald to john ursua to get within seven  then got to the army   with a minute left  but army survived along it way to   win <BRK>wahington state went     and reached a high a seventh in the ap  but in september  they were in danger of losing their second straight game until eaop winston went   yard <BRK>by richard johnson<BRK>you needn t remember anything but the fact that feleipe frank repeatedly shushed his own fan  including after scoring the winning touchdown <BRK>by richard johnson<BRK>florida showed it had more than one way to beat a good team  responding to a late deficit with actual offense <BRK>if dan mullen get this program back to college football s upper echelon  i ll remember oct    a the day i thought his program might just be something  it s been a long time since the swamp felt like this  it wa electric  loud  locked in  and full <BRK>this wa shaping up a a silly shootout until a defensive struggle broke out  unt exploded to a     lead  then tech responded with      the mean green scored late in the third quarter but missed a two point conversion for the tie <BRK>and that made the difference  unt hit the upright on a   yard field goal in the fourth quarter  then amik robertson blocked a   yarder in the final minute <BRK>pitt began by getting smoked by penn state and ucf and giving unc it only fbs win  the panther finished acc coastal champion thanks to an out of nowhere  five game conference winning streak  the first of those required overtime <BRK>pitt jumped to a     lead over an eventual   win syracuse before a     run  the panther scored   point in the final eight minute to force overtime  finally putting the game away with a darrin hall touchdown run and an immediate interception <BRK>the second win of pitt s division clinching streak wa even wilder  duke held four different double digit lead  but the panther caught fire over the last   minute  alex kessman hit field goal of   and   yard  no overtime wa necessary  though <BRK>memphis averaged     yard per play and got touchdown run of   and   yard from the great darrell henderson  navy fumbled three time  went   for   on third down  and trailed by   late <BRK>no matter  memphis fumbled four time itself  setting up a short field touchdown to make it      after a memphis punt came a vintage navy drive    play  seven minute  and the winning point on a three yard keeper by zach abey <BRK>by alex kirshner<BRK>symmetry  almost exactly a decade after michael crabtree stunned texas with a legendary touchdown at the front right pylon  the longhorn retaliated with a touchdown at the same spot on the same field  it wa even the same damn play call  four verts <BRK>there are enough wacky shootout in the big   that it s easy to lose track  an isu osu refresher <BRK>few gut punch are worse than ripping off a huge comeback and losing anyway  down      indiana got two touchdown pass from peyton ramsey  then tied on a stevie scott run with four minute left  but tanner morgan went deep to rashod bateman <BRK>byu out wisconsin d wisconsin and scored it second power   win of september when uw s kick sailed wide <BRK>the next five game on the list are the five greatest terrible game of the year  or maybe the worst good game  either way  they were close  compelling  and mind blowing <BRK>arizona needed a territorial cup win to secure bowl eligibility in kevin sumlin s first season and took a     lead into the fourth  asu scored twice  then the silly began <BRK>khalil tate threw an incredibly ill advised interception  asu kicked a field goal  j j  taylor suffered an unforced fumble  and asu took the lead on an eno benjamin run  arizona still had a chance  driving into asu territory in the final minute <BRK>but they ran down the clock and settled for a long kick  the   yard attempt sailed wide right  herm edward    sumlin   <BRK>a season s worth of mind numbing plot twist  a soaked will muschamp  and a sad mascot <BRK>college football <BRK>maybe the worst rutgers team in a generation   maybe mark dantonio s ugliest offense  the most predictable slog of the season <BRK>quarterback went   for   for   yard  four interception  and two sack  and yet  you had to keep watching because rutgers       rutgers    led until cody white s run with four minute left <BRK>team a gained   yard and had   drive end in opposition territory <BRK>team b gained   yard and had five drive end in opposition territory <BRK>team b won <BRK>by jason kirk<BRK>i blogged a post about this game s   dumbest moment  a few reader felt it wa one detail short  let s make that right <BRK>the ninth int   which nearly ended the cheez it bowl but wouldn t have counted  because tcu s sid got tangled up in a yard marker  though the sequence still set up the winning kick attempt that didn t involve the old pre icing kicker switcheroo   included   pound jake curhan running down   pound jawuan johnson  may curhan s name ring throughout the cheez it bowl s hall forever <BRK>the least ugly michigan state game of the year <BRK>michigan state won a pretty compelling game and knocked penn state out of playoff contention  it wan t pretty in any respect  but the game wa more dramatic and suspenseful than anything else  and msu at least ran a nice fake punt to set up one score <BRK>in retrospect  this almost feel like an upset  utah state charged to   win and a top   finish  while michigan state limped from preseason no    to     <BRK>but the first friday produced a stupendous  back and forth battle either way  the spartan led     when usu s gaje ferguson scored on a pick six  and darwin thompson gave the aggies a     lead with five minute left  but an acrobatic catch by felton davis set up a connor heyward touchdown  and usu s last ditch drive stalled <BRK>it is a legal requirement that ole miss and arkansas play one of the   best game of the season every year  including   s no     one difference about    ole miss won it <BRK>this wasn t the most amazing bowl season ever  but it still produced a few humdinger  including the next six game <BRK>this wa a boulder picking up speed  there were   score  and eight produced lead change  including six in the second half  the bearcat finally sealed their  th win   a hell of a turnaround for second year coach luke fickell   when michael warren scored with   second remaining and james wiggins picked off a pas at midfield <BRK>osu can lure anyone into a shootout  and mizzou wa happy to oblige  but in a game that featured     yard and   first down  late defense made the difference  first  mizzou s cam hilton picked off two pass to help charge back from      but osu s enoch smith and jarrell owen stuffed a third and   mizzou rush and forced a tiger field goal  which wa blocked  then  on fourth and   from the osu   with a minute left  and kolby peel chased drew lock down short of the stick <BRK>before butch davis came to fiu  the panther  best season wa an        they matched that in his first year  and in his second  they went      the last win  this back and forth bahamas bowl  fiu spotted an explosive toledo a     lead  then rallied on the back of anthony jones  whose third rushing touchdown iced the win <BRK>oh  an important fact about jones  he d been shot in the head in september <BRK> everybody would come to the hospital and they kept saying to me   man  you re a lucky dude  you re a lucky dude    jones said   and every time somebody said i wa a lucky dude  my mom corrected them fast  that s the only time she got mad  she kept saying   no  my baby s not lucky  he s blessed   and then i thought about it  and realized  she s right  thing could have been so much worse  <BRK>wazzu had never won   game before  given a chance to change that in the alamo bowl  the cougar bolted to a     lead thanks to two gardner minshew touchdown pass and a touchdown run  isu came back  nailing a   yard field goal at the halftime buzzer  then scoring   unanswered <BRK>wazzu s max borghi made it an eight point game  and after brock purdy scored with four minute left  the two point conversion fell incomplete  wazzu ran out the clock   by passing  of course <BRK>by morgan moriarty<BRK>the birmingham bowl featured   point    yard  and five lead change  but all of the excitement wa packed into the last   second  when <BRK>by steven godfrey<BRK>georgia southern won   game this year with a new coaching staff  the previous staff won two last year  that s because georgia southern ha the most inarguable blueprint in the entire sport  now and forever  if you love the triple option  it will love you back  it will express this love via hundred of rushing yard that bludgeon opponent into mush <BRK>do not believe the lie about the triple  it can come from behind  and it can do so quickly <BRK>the triple option love you  love it back or else <BRK>northwestern scored a few unlikely win on it way to a big ten west title  but the wildcat suffered an unlikely loss a well  down     at halftime  akron went on a stunning      run that included three defensive score  a   yard pick six by alvin davis  a fumble recovery in the end zone by aaron gilbert  and then another alvin davis pick six  that   is pretty hard to duplicate <BRK>the zip had never beaten a big ten team since before the zip or the big ten existed <BRK>every fan base deserves happiness at least once a season  right  oregon state s only fbs win came the hard way <BRK>after a   yard travon

red raider came in with starting qb alan bowman injured  and he would not finish the game due to a partially collapsed lung  but backup qb jett duffey didn t look like a backup against oklahoma s defense <BRK>while it never really felt like oklahoma wa in jeopardy of losing  due to the ease with which it point came  the sooner passed for   and rushed for     it wa yet another sign that kyler murray wa going to have to keep scoring all year long <BRK>by morgan moriarty<BRK>the first of two big comeback by ucf over memphis  though this one had a much closer final <BRK>memphis led a couple time in the first half       and       but the knight scored   unanswered <BRK>memphis had a chance for a winning field goal deep in ucf territory  but in the final   second  a memphis motion penalty required a clock runoff <BRK>what s better than a rivalry game that go to overtime <BRK>a rivalry game that go to overtime and end with a fight <BRK>after iowa established itself a maybe the team to

on the all time bowl record list <BRK>just a we all expected  not really   baylor and vanderbilt combined for one of the most gaudy yardage performance in postseaon history  a texa bowl barnburner <BRK>the     between the dores and the bear nestle right behind two other baylor performance on the all time bowl record list <BRK>i ve never been a fan of giving the losing team the mvp award  but ke shawn vaughn probably should have won it <BRK>matt rhule is angling baylor to be the changeup in the big    a team that ll pop your spread out defense in the mouth with the i formation  if the bear keep moving forward  remember the texa bowl a a huge step <BRK>texas couldn t stop big qb taylor cornelius from running at key moment  and then the coach ended up squabbling <BRK>by morgan moriarty<BRK>florida state took a     lead into the locker room  and the noles made that     in the third quarter <BRK>talk about defying odds  huh <BRK>for three quarter  every score resulted in a lead change  later  myron gailliard s score gave the mustang a     lead  pending the pat  they d be up   against a struggling offense  but jarvis polu blocked the pat  and jarid ryan returned it for two point to keep the lead at seven  six minute later  cj williams bolted   yard to send the game to overtime <BRK>after navy scored a touchdown  smu did the same and had the choice to go for two and the win  head coach sonny dyke seized the opportunity   with a video game play he and his staff found on google <BRK>willie fritz wa hired to steady a forever unstable tulane  and in his third season  he brought the green wave to their third bowl in   year  thanks to a down but feisty navy  that almost didn t happen <BRK>tulane led      and thing got dicey in a hurry  navy scored  forced a three and out  then immediately scored again on a gorgeous    yard pas from zach abey to malcolm perry  with     left  tazh maloy s plunge gave the midshipman a     lead <BRK>tulane struck back  and fritz had no interest in overtime <BRK>sometimes it s like a streak ha become sentient  no matter what the score is  no matter how much time is left  the streak find a way to keep itself alive <BRK>in blacksburg on thanksgiving weekend  a couple of streak conspired against uva  first  the cavalier hadn t beaten rival virginia tech since    second  the hokies hadn t missed a bowl since   <BRK>both eventually stayed alive  but they had to go to great length <BRK>with   second to go  old dominion trailed wku by a touchdown <BRK>with nine second to go  the score wa tied a odu kicked off <BRK>and then one of the strangest football ending ever happened <BRK>ah yes  the game that broke booger mcfarland <BRK>you can t blame the former defensive tackle for hating a game that featured team scoring at a basketball rate  they scored touchdown on   of   possession  and the sooner only won because of defensive touchdown  this wa exhausting <BRK>by morgan moriarty<BRK>the biggest point spread upset of    odu wa      but pulled off the first power   win in school history anyway  late in the fourth quarter  the monarch took a lead on this gorgeous catch by jonathan duhart <BRK>and sealed the victory with <BRK>bedlam might be one of college football s most one sided rivalry  but not for lack of trying  oklahoma state  still in need of one more win to reach bowl eligibility in a wacky year  put together it best effort of the season <BRK>it wa almost enough  ou led     in the second quarter  lol   but three chuba hubbard touchdown brought it even at      ou took the lead back  but tylan wallace s touchdown got osu to within one <BRK>mike gundy tried to wreck ou s playoff hope with a single two point conversion <BRK>by richard johnson<BRK>you wanna talk about the power of the in game adjustment  on the road and on the rope  the buckeye said   what if we made the whole offense out of screen   and it worked to devatating effect  on the go ahead drive  the buckeye steamrolled down the field a dwayne hakins rapidly came into his own <BRK>and then  with the game on the line   oh my god why did you do this  penn state <BRK>sigh  coach are smart  sometimes they outsmart themselves <BRK>sport are intensely cruel sometimes  one of week   s biggest game wa a statement opportunity for oregon and first year head coach mario cristobal over what we thought wa a top notch stanford <BRK>the duck did almost everything right  they outgained the cardinal by   yard  generated   more first down  and overcame an   yard fumble return to lead      all they needed wa one more first down  and cj verdell tried to make that happen <BRK>the rest of the game wa preordained  you already knew stanford would win in overtime <BRK>by steven godfrey<BRK>a series that used to determine the sec west ha become even better in the  s  now it determines the first narrative of each sec season  sometimes the resulting storyline are baseles  auburn losing to lsu in   and ending up in the national title game   and sometimes le mile get fired in september <BRK>against miami  we confirmed ed orgeron s team wan t bad  here we figured out it wa resilient  even mile lucky  we also got to meet cole tracy  whose parent have a full bar in their house  installed a if they knew their son would one day win game for lsu at the lat second <BRK>by richard johnson<BRK>day after trevor lawrence wa named clemson s starting qb  he left with an injury  former third stringer chase brice came in  since kelly bryant had just left the team due to lawrence s ascent <BRK>for whatever reason  syracuse s dino babers look like he ha clemson s number  the massive upset last year in the carrier dome wa about to repeat in death valley  following a shaky performance against texas a m  it felt like clemson wa slipping into the country s second tier <BRK>but brice did this   and nothing else mattered <BRK>lawrence and clemson quickly realized their elite potential  only one team scored more than   point against them the rest of the way   and it wasn t even alabama <BRK>by alex kirshner<BRK>the best example of how it s always the player who redeem college football <BRK>ohio state had spent month in the news for bungling abuse allegation against an assistant coach  maryland for failure leading to the post workout death of a player  the people in charge of these program highlighted some of the worst thing about this sport <BRK>so considering the hellish year facing maryland s player  it wa exciting to watch them go blow for blow with an elite opponent  it wa exciting to watch dwayne haskins continually push back  it wa painful to watch maryland miss an open man on what would ve been the winning conversion  but cool to see haskins win a game he deserved to win  whether all the powerful people above him did or not <BRK>northwestern had all of the good big ten karma  the wildcat found themselves down     in the fourth quarter  and the only reason they were that close wa because of a fumble return score  nebraska held every edge and led by   with     left <BRK>and northwestern won in overtime <BRK>what <BRK>in a game that would eventually clinch a rematch in the big   title game  tom herman s texas longhorn did almost everything right for three quarter  with a short yardage offense that kept ou s explosive attack off the field  and with help from turnover  texas found itself ahead     heading into the fourth quarter  the horn had outgained the no    offense by   yard <BRK>ou needed   play to gain   yard and tie the game  heisman winner kyler murray hit lee morris for a touchdown and exploded   yard down the sideline for a one play drive  after another punt  trey sermon gained   yard in three play for another score  rattled  texas had     to respond  the horn used almost every second in setting up freshman cameron dicker <BRK>you remember this game for two reason <BRK>one <BRK>two <BRK>a month of clutching pearl over horn down began <BRK>this seemed for three quarter like a comfortable statement win for the eventual national champion  but thing got weird  with barely two minute left  after cutting clemson s lead to      the aggies fell victim to one of the sport s most controversial rule  fumbling into the end zone for a touchback  but the aggies got another chance to tie and drove   yard in just three play to score  they still had to make the two point conversion  though <BRK>by jason kirk<BRK>since this unpaid amateur sporting event wa a      pay per view      people were only able to watch a playoff team and it oakland a s quarterback struggle into overtime against the u s  military s maddening underdog offense thanks to a twitch streamer who also agreed to show the internet his foot  any sentence the human brain can conceive  college football can make real <BRK>by steven godfrey<BRK>the tide can be beaten  clemson just beat the brake off of them  lesser team like ole miss and texas a m have snatched win  but there is a massive difference between those and georgia beating alabama through six of eight quarter in the calendar year <BRK>kirby smart s georgia wa supposed to be something more than a fluke or out of conference rival  georgia wa supposed to supplant the dynasty by building a bigger palace for one of nick saban s best former assistant <BRK>the bulldog still have little to show after coming so insanely close twice  so far  no matter how promising  they are still just the sec s latest imitation   oh  and the jalen hurt thing wa cool  <BRK>we fall in and out of love with this sport a lot  there s so much at which to marvel  and there s so much at which to rage against  we ll say it s fitting that the best football game of   wa a frustrating a it wa amazing <BRK>bad call       call   great call that we thought were terrible until the next day   premature gatorade bath   clutch play and mistake   all in a game that just refused to end  with a week long postgame fight controversy that raged even after the game tied the fbs record for ot period and set a new mark for point <BRK>we had to work a hard a ever to love this sport in    but a m and lsu did a lot of that work for u <BRK>    vox medium  inc
