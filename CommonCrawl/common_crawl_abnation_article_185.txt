it s a complicated time in baseball  last year s deep freeze of free agency seems to have wrapped it tendril at least partially around this current class  and of course the two biggest name on the market are still on the market  meanwhile  team have already seemingly sorted themselves into competitor and not competitor  meaning the demand for impact free agent is lessened <BRK>and then there s the behavior of the new york yankee  one of those team sorted into competitor  so far  the yankee have traded for a player with ace potential  retained a reliever and signed a utility player that ha never been a utility player in his career <BRK>the team wa also rumored to be in on both patrick corbin and manny machado  but never made a formal offer to the former and appear to have not done so with the latter  oh  they rolled out the red carpet for both  famously photoshopping corbin into yankee pinstripe and taking machado out to dinner   no report yet on whether the bill wa split <BRK>when it came time to extend offer  though  neither free agent received one  we now know that the yankee  internal valuation of corbin wasn t close to the market value of the pitcher s deal  and it seems they re in a similar position with regard to machado  in the end  the camp are so far apart that there s no real point in submitting a lowball offer <BRK>this kind of public demonstration matched with private disinterest isn t serving the yankee well in the long run  future entrant into a marketplace do well when they see and remember the signal sent by buyer  and more importantly  prospective buyer  a team like the national  known for their creativity in contract structure and willingness to spend  is probably a more attractive option for a seller than a team that can t even make competitive offer <BRK>this mean that it s entirely possible future free agent are taking the yankee le seriously than other team  member of the   class would see the fact that the team isn t offering close to market value for contract  so why bother to waste their time <BRK>let s take  a an example  the crown jewel of next year s free agent clases  chris sale and nolan arenado  the market for sale is just about every team in baeball   nobody doesn t need a left handed ace  but for this particular example let s highlight the houston atros  who will have a hole in their own rotation with justin verlander s free agency  for arenado  the market isn t quite a broad  but the yankee might decide they want to dabble in his service  the national will also have an opening at third  getting to pick between retaining anthony rendon or chaing arenado <BRK>now let s say you re nolan arenado  fielding offer from team  are you going to be more open to meeting with team that have historically spent  and done the legwork to build creative contract  or gravitate toward the team that  in recent history hasn t ponied up to what the market will bear <BRK>therein lie the problem with waiting until the next free agent class  which ha been and continues to be the mantra of so many fan  wait until next year  when xyz player is available  and go all out then  by the time that market open up  seller have received the signal that there s one le serious buyer <BRK>whether the yankee sign machado or not  they re going to be really good in    if they didn t feel corbin wa worth the contract the nats agreed to  that s fine  the problem is when the yankee consistently price themselves out of the market  year after year  agent aren t stupid  they re seeing that the yankee have le and le interest in making competitive offer  that drastically change the dynamic for the next free agent class  the one the team s supposed to be saving up for <BRK><BRK>
