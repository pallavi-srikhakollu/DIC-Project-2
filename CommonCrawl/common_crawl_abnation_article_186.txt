thanks to some seriously backloaded conference scheduling that would make hbo blush  this week see the first meeting of   for two of college basketball s most anticipated annual rivalry  first up on wednesday night  this bracket s no    overall seed  the duke blue devil  host tobacco road archrival north carolina tar heel  currently on line no     then  on sunday afternoon  we have the first of two michigan state spartan michigan wolverine showdown in a two week span  those in state rival currently share the big ten lead and join the tar heel on seed line two   <BRK> and those aren t the only two huge  potentially bracket altering showdown lurking this week  for the second saturday in a row  the tennessee volunteer will hit the road for their first matchup of the seaon with a fellow sec contender  but after their loss to the kentucky wildcat at rupp arena  the pressure will be on rick barnes  vols a they visit baton rouge for their lone scheduled contest with the lsu tiger  tennessee remains on the top line despite their saturday setback  but that s not likely to be the cae with a loss to the bayou bengal  <BRK> this week s result could really shake up what s become a rather stagnant top portion of the bracket  even if today s top line feature a slight change  duke remains at the top  but he virginia cavalier jumped tennessee into the second spot overall  with the gonzaga bulldog following the vols in fourth  once again  kentucky is the top no    seed  followed by michigan  unc and michigan state   <BRK> on seed line no     last week s quartet remains in place  though the kansa jayhawks  houston cougar and marquette golden eagle have all jumped the selection committee s top third seed  the purdue boilermakers  lsu lead the no    seed  followed by the nevada

struck me the most when putting together today s projection wa how confident i feel about seed line one through eight with le than a month to go  beyond that point  the national picture still feel unsettled  but that doesn t necessarily mean that the bubble is expanding  in fact  the past week saw a slew of power conference team on the fringe of the bid picture fall away  largely because of an epidemic of failure when opportunity were there to be seized   <BRK> while a few power team did pick up vital win to boost their hope  like florida  at alabama   butler  over depaul   temple  at usf  and nebraka  which ha suddenly managed to win two straight just before their toughest stretch begin saturday with a visit from purdue   the focus of the bubble ha shifted  you ll notice a trio of mid major are lurking among the first eight out  so not only do we have two mac and atlantic sun bid this week   the latter is thanks to lipscomb sticking around a an at large following a midweek loss to liberty  but two mountain west  southern and west coat bid can t be ruled out  <BRK> i m not quite ready to declare this the  year of the mid major at large bounty   but with the strength of team like buffalo  lipscomb and wofford  vcu managing to win needed game when so many other bubble team simply can t  and furman and utah state largely keeping themselves out of trouble in the loss column  it s becoming increasingly likely that some unexpected name will be called on the evening of march    <BRK> while i ll have another bubble update here on friday  starting tomorrow i ll have a daily updated seed list over at blogging the bracket   <BRK>
