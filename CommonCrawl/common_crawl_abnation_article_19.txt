the nfl s pas interference rule is always enforced with varying rigor  some day  defensive back have a bit more latitude than others to hit receiver before the ball arrives  maybe one week  a slight shove a half second before the ball arrives is fine  and the next week  the same shove get called  it happens in a high speed  high contact sport  <BRK>but this is hilarious  i need to compose myself after laughing for two minute at this premature body slam by the ram  nickell robey coleman not getting flagged  <BRK>tommylee lewis wa running a little wheel route on third and   from the ram    yard line  with the score tied at   in the final two minute of the nfc championship  he wa about to catch it just shy of the first down marker when robey coleman annihilated him  <BRK>there s a decent bit to the pi rule  but the biggest thrust of it is that  contact by a player who is not playing the ball that restricts the opponent s opportunity to make the catch  is not allowed  well  that mean you can t destroy a receiver well before the ball arrives if you  yourself  are not looking at the ball or making any effort to catch it  <BRK>had robey coleman been paying closer attention  he probably could ve cut the route  intercepted drew brees  pas  and run about   yard the other way  <BRK>robey coleman s aware of his action  and honest about them   <BRK>robey coleman   yes  i got there too early  i wa beat  and i wa trying to save the touchdown <BRK>he hadn t seen it  so i showed nickell robey coleman the replay of his hit on tommylee lewis   oh  hell yeah   he said   that wa pi   while admitting that  he also gave a fascinating  entirely convincing breakdown of why and how it wa a smart play <BRK>the nfl wa extremely aware of nickell robey coleman s action too  they slapped him with a      fine  which is undoubtedly the best      robey coleman ha ever spent in his life <BRK>nfl made an unofficial statement on the hit that ram  cb nickell robey coleman delivered on saint  wr tommylee lewis nfl fined robey coleman the amount of      for the helmet to helmet that wa not flagged during the nfc championship game  per source <BRK>the referee  bill vinovich  didn t say a lot  <BRK>bill vinovich  statement to  amie_just shed basically no light on the controversial no call in  ram  win over  saint  pic twitter com em bdndtp<BRK>it s impossible to overstate the impact of this egregious missed call  a proper pas interference call would ve allowed the saint to either score a touchdown or kill almost the entire remaining clock  likely wrapping the game in regulation either way  <BRK>the best the ram could ve reasonably hoped for would ve been to get the ball down with le than a minute left and no timeouts  trailing by    <BRK>instead  the saint got a   yard field goal from will lutz to go up      the ram countered with their own field goal drive immediately after that  bringing up overtime  greg zuerlein connected again in ot  on a   yarder after a drew brees interception  to get the ram to atlanta  <BRK>sean payton noticed  telling reporter afterward he hoped no team had to lose like that again  <BRK>payton called the league office   they blew the call <BRK>al riveron  the nfl s senior vp of officiating  spoke to sean payton after the game and told payton that pas interference should have been called  no public comment by the league at this point <BRK>saint owner gayle benson released a strongly worded statement that made it clear this will continue to be a major storyline in the offseason   and that change could be coming to the nfl rulebook <BRK>no team should ever be denied the opportunity to reach the title game  or simply win a game  baed on the action  or inaction  of those charged with creating a fair and equitable playing field  a is clear to all who watched the game  it is undeniable that our team and fan were unfairly deprived of that opportunity yesterday  i have been in touch with the nfl regarding yesterday s event and will aggressively pursue change in nfl policy to ensure no team and fan bae is ever put in a similar position again  it is a disservice to our coach  player  employee and  most importantly  the fan who make our game possible  the nfl must always commit to providing the most baic of expectation  fairness and integrity <BRK>the saint had other chance to win  but it will sting for a long time that they probably would have anyway if the correct call had been made here   <BRK>payton said the call is tough to get over   we ll probably never get over it  <BRK>i believe him <BRK><BRK>
