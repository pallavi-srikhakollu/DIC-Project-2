the   nfl seaon s crooked road branched off into a thouand potential path sunday  but the football god blazed a trail that led u all to gaze in atonishment of sean mcvay s rising star and simultaneouly wonder how a   year old tom brady and his eternally angry escaped skeksis of a head coach are still able to do this  the ram and patriot were the clear winner of conference championship sunday a they head on to super bowl     <BRK> the saint and chief were their counterpart on the unhappy side of the ledger  with their dream of a championship slipping from their grasp  <BRK> but there were far more winner and loser beyond the   active roster player who start their winter break on monday  sunday s game were a sloppy  glorious mess that filled the gap between play with unrealistic expectation and crushing anxiety  so who came out of the conference title game smelling like rose  and who actually smell like poo poo oo  yeah   <BRK> let s dive in  <BRK> for having to watch the patriot in another super bowl  <BRK> at least the patriot have always given u exciting super bowl  so there s hope for a great game on feb     but unless you re a patriot fan  you ve had enough of their smug face in the biggest game of the year  give me a total snoozer of a super bowl if it mean the patriot aren t going to be there  something like the seahawks bronco  bronco blowout  i wish  or the bronco defense dragging a decrepit peyton manning to his second lombardi trophy against an overmatched panther squad  in my dream   <BRK> by the way  those are the only two super bowl since   that haven t featured the patriot  if only  <BRK> we just experienced an incredibly fun season in the nfl and an exhilarating conference championship round  the super bowl will probably be excellent  every super bowl with bill belichick and tom brady in it is  <BRK> even if the team in the final game of the seaon aren t the two we wanted to see there   or at leat one of them   that shouldn t take away from one hell of a seaon  when the product is a good a it wa this year  it s eay to remember why we love this game so much  <BRK> in just his first year a starter  mahomes exceeded every wild expectation heaped upon him  he threw pases we didn t know were physically possible  he ll win league mvp  he wa a huge reaon why this nfl seaon wa such a blat   <BRK> he won t make it to the super bowl  not this year  maybe he could have if he had a chance to win the game for the chief  but the patriot started with the ball in overtime and that s all it took to send them on to atlanta   <BRK> we would have liked to see him try  but he wa more zen about it than most fan probably were  <BRK> mahomes on not winning the ot coin toss   sometimes that s just the way the coin toss  <BRK> how can you not love this guy  <BRK> thank you  chiefskingdomthis hurt now but we will be back love y all for y alls support  <BRK> you will be back  this is only the beginning of your journey into football s hall of the immortal  <BRK> big play could win the ram a super bowl <BRK> patriot are a handful for any team <BRK> tom brady s legacy is untouchable <BRK> missed call cost the saint a super bowl trip <BRK> greg zuerlein kicked the ram to atlanta <BRK> where wa todd gurley v  new orleans  <BRK> belichick   brady  nine super bowl <BRK> tom brady and bill belichick are headed to their ninth super bowl together  which is twice a many time a any other qb coach duo in nfl history  they ve won five  brady  who owns an obscene number of playoff record  ha four super bowl mvp   <BRK> so you re not alone if you did a sitcom style spit take when brady referred to the patriot a  underdog  and said the  odds were stacked against  them  but you know what  whatever motivation they needed worked  brady  who didn t have a great game statistically with two pick and     paser rating  did his best work with the game on the line   <BRK> the patriot took the lead with   second left on a drive that saw brady complete three pass for    yard   he also threw a pick  but it wa wiped out due to dee ford s offside penalty  the football god love brady  we know this   <BRK> then in overtime  he helped engineer a   play touchdown drive to win the game  brady didn t have to do it all himself   rex burkhead scored both of those final two touchdown   but he once again showed why he s the goat  and that he s adding to his legacy at   is still unbelievably believable  <BRK> the referee missed a huuuuuuge call toward the end of the fourth quarter of the nfc championship that very likely decided the game  saint receiver tommylee lewis wa going out to catch a pas from drew brees when he got absolutely leveled by nickell robey coleman  <BRK> that no call stopped the saint from being able to score a potential touchdown on the drive    or at leat run the clock down and kick the game winning field goal a time expired  instead  the game went to overtime and the ram won  <BRK> sean payton wa incensed after the game  robey coleman even admitted that he had committed dpi  it didn t matter  the saint were left dealing with another heartbreaking playoff loss   <BRK> not that the official were one sided  they also missed a couple of facemasks that the saint committed  <BRK> the referee weren t much better in the afc championship game  they called a weak roughing the passer penalty on tom brady that helped get the patriot into scoring position late in the game   <BRK> please send tom brady your prayer after this violent roughing the passer penalty pic twitter com  zt s tko  <BRK> earlier in the game  mahomes didn t get the same call  <BRK> we rated it our no    potential super bowl matchup back in the divisional round  the chief and ram put together the greatest monday night football game of all time and scored more point than all but two other nfl game in history in the process  we were a coin flip away from running it back   <BRK> thanks for ruining that  tom brady  <BRK> greg zuerlein cemented himself a a kicking legend when he hit the   yard game winning kick to punch the ram  ticket to super bowl    <BRK> greg the leg end   pic twitter com  aa rirmb <BRK> zuerlein made all four of his field goal and both of his extra point attempt  accounting for   of the ram    point on the day  he kicked the field goal that sent the game to overtime and the one that sent his team to the super bowl  <BRK> that make him a  game  winner in our book  <BRK> dante fowler ha to be feeling good right now  this time lat year  he wa a member of the jacksonville jaguar coming off of an afc championship game loss to the new england patriot  in that game  fowler balled out with two sack and three quarterback hit  but it wan t enough a the jaguar lost      <BRK> now  a a member of the los angeles ram  fowler made the play to help them get to the super bowl  <BRK> fowler spun around saint tackle ryan ramczyk to get a solid hit on drew brees a he wa throwing the ball  the ball landed in john johnson s hand for an interception  <BRK> incredible play by both dante fowler and john johnson  who is allowed to interfere here w michael thomas because the ball wa tipped pic twitter com c h gzpjf <BRK> a few play later  zuerlein made the kick that sent los angeles to the super bowl  <BRK> griffin had just one reception in a three year nfl career that had seen him go undrafted in   and waived by the saint on three separate occasion  he wasn t supposed to get much playing time in the nfc championship  but ben watson s appendicitis and josh hill s head injury pushed the third string tight end into the lineup  he didn t let the opportunity slip by unnoticed  <BRK> brees to  g grif for a   yd td  saint up     with     left in the  st  homeinthedome pic twitter com mpncxqsb v <BRK> griffin emerged with his first nfl touchdown catch when ram defensive back marcus peter picked his own man to spring the air force alum in the end zone  he d finish his game with two reception for   yard and a score   not much  but all career high  <BRK> tony romo didn t get the chance to go to the super bowl when he wa the quarterback of the dalla cowboy  but he ll be there this year a part of the cbs broadcat crew   <BRK> and we can t wait  <BRK> romo is a delight in the booth  a we ve known since lat seaon when he made his announcing debut  he s also a bit of a wizard  his ability to predict play before they happen   especially when it s the patriot   will make the super bowl more bearable  <BRK> you thought tom brady wa great tonight  here s some snippet of tony romo s late game forecasting wizardry  pic twitter com sh q ijfj <BRK> and thankfully  jason witten will be far  far away  <BRK> it s not breaking news that the superdome is loud a hell  but the saint fan really brought it for the nfc championship game  not only were the saint fan loud enough to shake the press box  but there wa also someone whistling loud enough for the camera to pick it up   <BRK> the whistler is a guy that go by  whistle monsta   somehow he ha perfected whistling to the point that it interfered with an actual nfl broadcast  <BRK> did anyone hear the  whistle man   saint  pic twitter com ghzyiiqceh <BRK> one good aspect of the saint not reaching the super bowl  we won t have to hear from the so called whistle monsta  <BRK> gronkowski had only one reception in new england s divisional round win over the charger and had the fewest receiving yard per game since his rookie season back in    but when tom brady needed someone to make a play with the game on the line  there wa gronk   chugging past eric berry and making the all pro safety look like an overmatched high school kid in the process  <BRK> gronk finished his day with six catch for   yard    of those yard came on the two scoring drive that put the patriot in the lead in the final minute of the game and then won it in overtime  and when he wan t catching pass  he wa keeping opposing linebacker and defensive back the hell away from his runner  <BRK> gronk just blocked a poor  unwitting chief defensive back into oblivion pic twitter com xkjnbggdto <BRK> another championship game between la and boston  we just saw that a few month ago between the dodger and red sox in the world series  what s next  a celtic lakers nba final  <BRK> well  probably not this year  but maybe a celtic warrior one  <BRK> there s a silver lining  at least  finally  the two coast will get some national attention  that never happens  <BRK>  <BRK>
