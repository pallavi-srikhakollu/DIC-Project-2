head coach  dana dimel       second year  <BRK>   record and s p  ranking        th  <BRK> projected   record and s p  ranking        th  <BRK> five key point  <BRK> bill c s annual preview series of every fbs team in college football continues  catch up here  <BRK> when utep head coach mike price retired after the   season  former miner offensive lineman sean kugler came to town with knowledge of what he wa getting into  he had a  build in the trench and out tough everyone  plan  but he couldn t attract either the talent or the assistant coach and went      <BRK> five year after starting over  utep started over again  it took a while to find a kugler replacement  but dana dimel  one time wunderkind  decided he wanted a second shot  no matter the risk  <BRK> hired by wyoming at age   after two successful seaon a bill snyder s kansa state offensive coordinator  dimel had won   game in three seaon in laramie  good enough to earn him the houston job     where he won just eight in three  cat to the trah heap  he ended up back with snyder in manhattan  still only in his mid  s  he found an opportunity to lead an fbs team once more  <BRK> a with kugler  you can see what dimel want to do  he and snyder evolved  devolved   from a more pas heavy attack in the mid  s to physicality and zone read  at it best  the offense combine power with the ability to spread defender out   despite the wildcat  qb run heavy approach  they routinely led the nation in the number of solo tackle they forced defender to make  <BRK> defensively  ksu played soft and structured on standard down  waiting for opponent to make a mistake  then trying to finish them off once leveraged behind schedule  <BRK> despite recruiting at a lower level than most of their big   peer  the wildcat won eight or more game six time in seven season in the  s  this approach can work   <BRK> but we don t yet know whether it will work in el paso  utep did go just     in dimel s first season  but the miner appeared to be getting somewhere before they ran out of steam  <BRK> the middle third of the season wan t impressive  exactly  but it wa intriguing  after they got dominated by fcs  northern arizona  it wa a clear step forward to see them losing by only a combined   to north texas and louisiana tech  after a     loss to eventual conference usa champ uab  they outlasted rice       to end a   game losing streak  <BRK> granted  they sort of mailed it in after that  that ll happen sometimes  but for a brief time  playing this team wasn t very much fun  <BRK> unfortunately  dimel wa fielding a team pretty heavy on senior  there is quite a bit of continuity in the offensive backfield  but he ha to break in an almost entirely new receiving corp and about seven new defensive starter  <BRK>

   <BRK> yearlong statistic aren t going to tell u much  a utep s offense wa desolate for much of    they averaged under five yard per play six time  under     four time  <BRK> but let s focus on their decent performance  they scored   point on both north texas and louisiana tech  then put up   on rice and   on mtsu  this wa the closest thing we got to a glimpse of a happy future  <BRK> what were the miner accomplishing  they were figuring out diverse way to move the ball on standard down   passing down weren t a success  even during this run   <BRK> they had to play three different quarterback during this span  a kai locksley missed time with an ankle injury and ryan metz battled a concussion  against unt and lt  though  this grab bag went   for   for   yard      per completion  on standard down   they were leaning heavily enough into their run tendency to find go route opportunity downfield in run situation  <BRK> against rice and mtsu  they simply ran the ball well  back quardraiz wadley and treyvon hughes combined for   carry and   yard      per carry  in those game even though the pas didn t really work  <BRK> so that s the vision of dimel s and veteran coordinator mike canales  offense  run a lot on standard down    percent of the time   th in fbs  and play off of every potential counter   run the qbs a lot if it s working  run the rb a lot if it s working  go deep to keep defense honest  it s not the most creative vision  but it can work  <BRK> there s strong continuity for run game personnel  at leat  locksley and brandon jones are scheduled to return  locksley is the better runner      yard per non sack carry to jones        but jones found the most vertical pasing success    yard per completion to       dimel also inked lanky          three star freshman tj goodwin of houston cy fall a part of what the el pao time called  eaily utep s top clas in almost a decade   <BRK> wadley and hughes are senior a well  wadley wa eaily the more explosive back of the two  but he fumbled five time  and hughes gained at leat four yard on a higher percentage of his carry    percent to     perhaps the most intriguing back  however  han t taken a snap yet  <BRK> dimel signed mid three star freshman deion hankins from nearby el paso parkland  the        pound hankins rushed for     yard last season and claimed offer from school like arkansas and oklahoma state  his hudl film show a back with good vision  a quick first step  and some girth  if not top end speed  <BRK> this pretty good trio of back might have a good line  guard bobby deharo earned honorable mention all conference honor a a freshman  big senior ruben guerra and markos lujan have combined for   career start  and four other young returnees started at leat one game lat year  <BRK> utep might have the piece to lean into it run first identity  the miner will have to  however  because there s no reason to think the passing game will be more consistent  <BRK> locksley and jones both completed under   percent of their pas  and that wa before they lost four of lat year s top five target  the receiver position is extremely green  but if you re hunting for positive spin  there s this  the returnees are fat  foster      yard per catch  is back  a are slot men walter dawn jr     per catch over part of three seaons  and tre shon wolf      a a freshman   they are all or nothing guy  but so are their qbs  <BRK> any hope for consistency might come from the tight end  utep s were up the seam threat  catching   of   pass for   yard      per catch   but they are gone  so dimel signed a pair of jucos  luke laufenberg and rashad beecham  to fill the void  <BRK> a daily ish mini column on the college football thing of the day  with some other stuff too  <BRK> the utep defense wa easily the steadier unit  it played more than four decent game and ranked  th in def  s p    not good  but better than the offense   th   unfortunately  it wa extremely senior heavy  three of last year s top five linemen  the top two linebacker  and the top three defensive back are all gone  dimel signed five juco defender to stem the tide  but coordinator mike cox  also a former kansa state assistant  might have his work cut out for him just matching last year s number  <BRK> the secondary should come around first  utep wa aggressive in pas defense  ranking  th in pasing marginal efficiency and  nd on pasing down  but while safety kahani smith and both starting corner are gone  there is still a solid corp with veteran safety justin rogers and michael lewis  combined      tackle for loss    pases defensed  and corner josh caldwell  <BRK> at least one of three juco cornerback  preferably two  will need to contribute quickly  and depth is an obvious issue  but there s some stability back there  <BRK> up front  the miner at leat have denzel chukwukelu for one more seaon  the   pounder from rockwall stepped up in    recording     tfls and     run stuff  but he ll have mostly new dance partner around him a newcomer attempt to pas veteran backup on the depth chart  <BRK> dimel got solid production out of since departed linebacker a j  hotchkins and jamar smith and will replace them with some combination of jucos  joe jay smith  dj turner   the aforementioned veteran  dylan parsee  stephen forester  kalaii griffin  and youth  sophomore sione tupou  mid three star freshman jerome wilson   <BRK> up front  you ve got chukwukelu and fellow senior chris richardson at tackle  but end is an almost total unknown  junior christian johnson and redshirt freshman praise amaewhule combined for three tackle last year  they re your returning leader  the miner had a pretty good pas rush in blitz situation in    but most of the player responsible for those sack are gone  <BRK> outside of place kicking  utep had a respectable unit  unfortunately  place kicking is kind of important  then senior jason filley went just   for   on field goal outside of   yard  and for a team that needed to coax point out of even the most tenuous scoring chance  that wa costly  sophomore to be gavin baechle showed a strong leg on kickoff  so maybe that improves  <BRK> often used punter mitchell crawford kicked ball high and unreturnable  which resulted in a poor average      yard per kick  but a decent net        <BRK> i tried to focus on the high point  but the low point were low enough to rank utep  th  dead last  in s p  in    and while the offense is projected to improve with decent returning production  the defense is projected to take an equal step backwards  the result  a projection of  th again  <BRK> honestly  i would expect something a little bit higher than that  utep still doesn t have the depth to carry a high performance for   game  but the miner should take last year s four game sample of solid play and make it more like six or eight  the run game should be sound  the pasing game should produce random explosion  and newcomer should help to create an at least decent pas defense  even if the run defense and pas rush are bad  <BRK> there are some potential win on the table  four of utep s six home game come against team projected  th or worse in fbs  if the miner are merely a top   team or so  they could easily end up with three to five win  a definable accomplishment for a team that s won once in two year   <BRK> really  though    is about continuing to build  provide a little bit more proof of concept  hope that some of your   signees break in  and give them room to grow  <BRK> dimel s energetic recruiting gave utep fan reason for hope  but it s going to take at least one more season before there s reason to raise the bar  <BRK> all   preview data to date  <BRK>
