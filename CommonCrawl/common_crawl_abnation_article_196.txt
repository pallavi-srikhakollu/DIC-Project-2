dick vitale didn t even need to be prompted to bring up the hypocrisy that underscore college sport in the middle of a conversation about the ncaa tournament last week <BRK> i ll tell you this  kid like zion  williamson   they deserve to make some money   vitale told sb nation   there s no doubt in my mind  want to get rid of all the sleaziness  want to get rid of the agent behind the scene  all the wheeling and dealing and nonsense we read about  it s very simple  <BRK>vitale ha had a four decade career in broadcasting after coaching both at the college and nba level in the  s  month ahead of his  th birthday  vitale continues to be one of the sport s biggest and most visible cheerleader  when even dick vitale can see the sham of athlete going unpaid while billion of dollar shuffle hand below them  you know the ncaa ha a problem <BRK> the ncaa can t pay the player   vitale continued   don t have enough money they say to take care of every athlete in all sport  if a kid is good enough  and an agent want to give him money  let them give him money  if zion want to get an agent  what s the big deal  what about if you make an appearance  and do endorsement  why not  let them do it  let kid do that  <BRK> if taylor swift wa on campus a a student  she d be allowed to do concert and make million  certain kid in every profession  be it the corporate world  the legal world  people on the top and people on the bottom  can make those dollar  why should we deny them  it would get rid of all the sleaziness because now you don t have those sleazy guy operating because it s legal  <BRK>vitale talked to sb nation about the favorite in march madness  his way way of getting more mid major in the ncaa tournament  and his love of live music all while promoting paper towel and dishing out recipe with bounty  the following is our conversation with vitale <BRK>dick vitale  i think it s wide open  but when push come to shove i see about eight team that win six consecutive game  i think the acc ha three legit team that can win it in virginia  duke  and north carolina  you go to the sec  three heavyweight  kentucky  tennessee  lsu  gonzaga is in that mix a well  michigan and michigan state  a well <BRK>right now  we re looking at a scenario where there s a lot of upset happening early  a few surprise  a we get to the sweet    and then reality set in <BRK>dv  i think they have a chip on their shoulder  that wa shock city  not just that they got beat  but the way they got beat  one thing about virginia  they have three guy that are a good a any collegiate threesome on the perimeter  you got ty jerome  kyle guy  and de andre hunter  who is a tremendous defensive player a well  <BRK>tony bennett know how to win  he had the misstep last year  but he s been sensational  they re still a great team defensively  and they re better offensively than people give them credit for <BRK>dv  they re in a great place  you look at that club  they lost  joshua  langford  he averaged      point per game  when you lose a player like that while playing in a heavyweight league  and then they lose the kid  nick  ward  their best inside presence  and they re still having success  <BRK>cassius winston ha been terrific  he s one of my super seven player in the country  he s been brilliant all year  and then izzo  great motivator  the player love him  they play hard for him  they ll never lose because they aren t giving effort  he s a hall of famer on the sideline  combine that with some outstanding talent  and you got a chance to win  <BRK>they have some depth there  they may not have the jaren jackson of the world  but they have very good  quality player <BRK>dv  you bring up something very near to my heart  what make the tournament special is having the little guy play the big guy  what we need is more little guy in the tournament  we need to reward greatness instead of mediocrity  if you go three or four game under     you don t belong over a team like belmont that go      or lipscomb  who go      or hofstra at      these are team that had great year  reward greatness <BRK>my plan is very simple  the dickie v plan  we have   at large berth  give   of them to the power conference  give eight of them to mid major  give me     the best mid major who don t qualify by winning their conference tournament  we d have some beautiful matchup there that people want to see  it s about rewarding greatness over mediocrity  <BRK>losing     game  losing several more game than you won in conference  do you really belong in over those mid major kid who had the type of year that they had  i don t want to hear about quad i win  they get so many opportunity <BRK>what make march madness special is those matchup  with the david and goliath  <BRK>gwen stefani
