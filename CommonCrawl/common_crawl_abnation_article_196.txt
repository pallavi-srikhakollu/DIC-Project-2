one of the most hyped regular season game of the     season to date took a bit of a hit earlier this week when duke freshman point guard tre jones went down with a shoulder injury and the blue devil were subsequently dealt a surprising overtime loss by syracuse   <BRK> jones isn t expected to be sidelined for a significant period of time  but he is expected to miss saturday s showdown with unbeaten virginia  that s a bummer  but this is still a meeting of the only two team in the country that rank in the top five of both ken pomeroy s adjusted offensive and defensive efficiency ranking  it s also a meeting of two of the team that are undoubtedly near the top of list when talking about the team s most likely to cut down the net on april     <BRK> here are three more reason to get hyped for the game  which tip off at   p m  et on espn  <BRK> virginia currently owns the odd distinction of being no    in the coach poll  but jut no    in the ap top    the top ranked team in the latter poll  at least for the time being  is duke  that mean saturday s game is going to give u jut the fourth  no    v  no     clash in the history of college basketball  and jut the third in the regular season   <BRK> the list of previous no    v  no    tilt  <BRK> cincinnati    california    march        final four  <BRK> ohio state    wisconsin    feb        <BRK> kansa    oklahoma      ot   jan         <BRK> twice  the ap no     cincinnati  kansa  ha prevailed  with ohio state being the lone coach poll top dog to claim victory   <BRK> the most recent of those three game wa notable for oklahoma star buddy hield dropping   point inside allen fieldhouse despite his team s heartbreaking defeat  also worth mentioning is the fact that the     cincinnati team hammered nyu       one day after it win over to cal to claim the   national championship   <BRK> virginia duke is always going to feature a heavy contrast in style  but some of the game within the game featured in this year s first matchup are particularly noteworthy   <BRK>  virginia play at the second slowest pace      possession per   minute  of any team in college basketball  crawling behind only siena  only one of the cavalier  opponent this season ha been able to play above it average pace against uva  that wa marshall  whose achievement came hand in hand with a     drubbing  duke  meanwhile  play at the  th fastest pace of any team in the country  the devil have had zero game with a pace lower than    while virginia ha had exactly one game above that pace   <BRK>  shooting just     percent from beyond the arc  duke is on pace to be the worst three point shooting team in program history  the blue devil still attempt a whopping     three pointer a game  but their percentage rank them  th out of   division i team  they re coming off an especially frigid performance from deep  connecting on jut   of   trey in their overtime loss to syracuse  on the flip side  virginia defends the three better than any team in college basketball  limiting opponent to just     percent shooting from beyond the arc   <BRK>  only seven team in the country get a higher percentage of their point from transition baket than duke doe  which make sense given the blue devil  elite speed and athleticism  a always  though  virginia rank in the top five in division i in transition defense   <BRK> assuming virginia continues to be one of the most impressive team in college basketball for the next month and a half  the stage is set for all of u to be bombarded with  why is this uva team different   column come early march  refresh sbnation com constantly for more    <BRK> for some  there s no answer to that question that s going to suffice  until virginia play up to it potential in the ncaa tournament and the hoos breakthrough into the final four  they will be labeled a perennial march choker by a large segment of the sporting public   <BRK> for those who want to give tony bennett s team the benefit of the doubt until proven  again  otherwise  the obvious difference between this virginia team and other recent cavalier squad is that this one is superior on offense  entering this weekend  uva is averaging     point per game and is no    in ken pom s adjusted offensive efficiency ranking  for the sake of comparison  lat year s virginia team   which entered the ncaa tournament a the no    overall seed   ranked no    in this same category  two seaons ago they were no      <BRK> virginia ha scored more than   point in two of it four acc game to date  and just dropped   in a   point beatdown of no    virginia tech tuesday night  that said  duke will be the best defensive team uva ha faced to date  the blue devil are fourth in adjusted defensive efficiency  eighth in effective field goal percentage defense  second in block percentage and first in steal percentage   <BRK> the home team will have an obvious advantage when it come to size and athleticism saturday afternoon  how virginia deal with that when it ha the ball will be the most interesting aspect of this game   <BRK>
