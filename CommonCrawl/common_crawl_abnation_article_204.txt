before i start my article  i want to make something clear to you  i m maybe the biggest patriot fan you ll ever meet  i went to my first game in    when i wa   year old  my  th birthday gift  in    wa a season ticket  and i ve been to almost every home game since  when i wa in college  my dad would pick me up from worcester on friday night and drive me back on sunday night so that i could go to the game  so  question my loyalty all you want  and call me a fake fan  that s fine  i m not here for clickbait  and i m not going to hide my feeling  i promised myself i d always be honest here  and that s what i m doing   <BRK> the first obvious question is  why would i pick the patriot to lose  there are a few reason  but the biggest one for me is that they are playing on the road  they haven t won a road playoff game since    granted  they ve only played three road playoff game since that win  but they haven t won any of them  tom brady is simply a different quarterback on the road in the playoff  and his number show that  <BRK> in   home playoff game  his record is      he completes his pass at a rate of     which is his exact career completion percentage  he also ha   touchdown and only   interception  in seven road playoff game  on the other hand  his record is      he ha completed his pass at a rate of only     and he ha eight score and eight pick  he also left his first road playoff game  a win in pittsburgh  with an injury right before the half  the patriot were up     and driving when he wa injured  but he didn t win that game  drew bledsoe did   <BRK> do these stats mean that brady is incapable of playing well on the road  of course not  he s the greatest quarterback of all time  he can play well anywhere  in fact  three of his four loss have been in denver  a place where brady and the patriot have historically struggled  another place where brady ha struggled in the past  granted in a much smaller sample size  in kansa city  he is     all time at arrowhead stadium  <BRK> the last time the patriot played there  the dynasty wa falling apart and people were calling for jimmy garoppolo to start over brady  that s not even his worst performance in kansa city  though  in    he threw four interception in a     november loss  clearly that game in   wa a wake up call for that team  and it went on to win the super bowl  but the game still happened  and it s the last memory we have of the patriot playing at arrowhead   <BRK> the last reason i have is very simple  they had an opportunity to have this game at home  and they blew it  you usually don t get away with making mistake like that  for instance  just a few year ago  in    the patriot had to beat the jet or dolphin in the last two week of the season to get the number one seed over the bronco  they got pushed to overtime by the jet  won the coin toss  and elected to kick off to new york  who promptly scored a touchdown to win the game  <BRK>

   <BRK> then they decided to run steven jackson what felt like   time for   yard  editor s note  it wa actually   for    against the dolphin  and they lost that game too  because of those two loss  they had to go into denver  and they were sent packing  one of the main reason for the loss wa the defense starting jumping the silent count that they had to use because of the crowd noise  if that game wa played in foxboro  they make  and probably win  another super bowl  <BRK> so here we are again in the same spot  the patriot didn t show up in jacksonville  then they didn t show up in detroit  then they beat the chief to earn the tiebreaker for first place  only to not show up against tennessee a few week later  the final two nail in the coffin were the fiaco in miami and pittsburgh desperately trying to let the patriot win  only to have the patriot want to lose even more  win one of those game  and this game is played in foxboro  shoot  put a defensive back  instead of rob gronkowski  a the deep man in miami  and this game is in foxboro  <BRK> the football god don t look too kindly on missed opportunity  and i think this is one that will cost them a trip to another super bowl  that being said  there are two very big glimmer of hope  possibly big enough to be ray of sunshine  for new england  <BRK> the first is that the team that showed up last week against the charger is a different one than the one we ve seen pretty much all year  brady wa downright surgical  julian edelman wa amazing  and the defense  before some garbage time point  wa lockdown  the question is  can the patriot repeat that this week  if anyone can  it s the patriot  but it will be difficult to do on the road  <BRK> the second glimmer for me is that right the patriot are  the team that no one belief in   they re not fabricating it either  they are underdog this week  and they are embracing that role  and using all of the hate for motivation  the team that no one belief in is tough to knock out of the playoff  especially when it posse a much talent a the patriot  these two thing were almost enough to sway me  but i m sticking to my gun  plus  if they really are feeding off the hate  then maybe this article will help  <BRK> so i just told you why i think the patriot will lose  but there s one more thing i want you to know  i hope i m dead wrong  i want to be wrong so bad it hurt  i m hoping fred segal cold take me  and that my mention are a dumpster fire on twitter  because  in the end  i couldn t care le whether i m right  i just want the patriot to win  but  a i said  i promised myself to always be honest  so i m being honest and telling you i think they re going to lose this week  <BRK> here s hoping i m wrong and after this week the patriot will be onto atlanta instead of onto the offseason   <BRK> pat is the host of the patriot nation podcast <BRK> interact with him on twitter  plane_pats <BRK>
