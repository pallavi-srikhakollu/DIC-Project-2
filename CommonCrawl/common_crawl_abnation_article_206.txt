the nfl offseason is the time for rumor  and among the most intriguing one so far this year is the one concerning odell beckham jr  and the new england patriot  let s start at the beginning  according to a report by one time patriot low level assistant coach chris simms  the club aggressively tried to trade for the wide receiver all of last offseason before his team  the new york giant  backed down to keep him  <BRK> how much truth lie in the rumor can be disputed  but what can not is the fact that patriot head coach bill belichick spoke glowingly of beckham jr  in the past   good  really quick  tough kid  go inside for the ball  very good after the catch and make a lot of play with the ball in his hand  he s a hard guy to tackle  he s got good quickness and good ability to separate   belichick said about beckham jr  in    <BRK>  but i d say the thing that s impressed me the most about him is his toughness   new england s coach continued   i mean he s not a big guy  but he competes well  he go inside  go after the ball  take a hit  hang on to it  he s a tough  competitive player and very good with the ball in his hand  not just going up and getting it  he s got obviously a bunch of highlight catch  but when he catch the ball he can run with it and make play with his quickness and his open field running ability   <BRK> when going by belichick s remark about the wideout  seeing his team have a genuine interest in getting him to new england doe not seem unrealistic  but would a trade for beckham jr  actually make sense from the patriot  point of view  and how would it look like considering the cost involved  let s take a look at three factor that might determine how realistic the patriot acquiring the giant  star wideout really is  <BRK> back in    belichick listed some of the trait that make beckham jr  one of the nfl s elite wide receiver to this day and a player that would likely be a tremendous fit in new england  combining quickness  route running  and an ability to make play with the football in his hand  the former first round draft pick might flourish when given the opportunity to play alongside a quarterback like tom brady and in a scheme like the patriot   <BRK> friend of pat pulpit evan lazar recently noted over at clns that beckham jr s ability to be effective on slant route  double move  and when lining up in the slot are three of the reason why his success in new york could also be duplicated in new england if a trade would indeed take place  what also stand out  though  is the wide receiver s football iq and understanding of how to get himself in a position to be successful  <BRK> just take a look at this play from   s opening day meeting with the jacksonville jaguar  that saw beckham jr  align in the left side slot  <BRK> beckham jr       know the concept run by the giant offense well enough to patiently enter into his route and wait for the natural pick to set itself and clear a path for him  while cornerback jalen ramsey      take himself out of the play by staying too focused on his assignment  the receiver know how to use this to his advantage and to get open for a   yard gain on the deep pas  <BRK> while beckham jr  run only one in five route from the slot  on average  his general knowledge of how to attack his opposition is on perfect display above  the next play  meanwhile  show just dangerous of a player he can be due to his athletic ability   from the straight line speed to his ability to get open and generate yard after catching the football  <BRK> the giant align in a  x  alignment with beckham jr  a the outermost receiver in the trip formation to the right  at the snap  he quickly maneuver his way through traffic to get open against cornerback desmond trufant        and due to his speed  the receiver is able to create a significant cushion between himself and the defensive back  quarterback eli manning hit him in stride and beckham jr  immediately turn upfield to generate additional yardage  <BRK> his quickness to get open and cut up the field with the football in his hand is just one part of what make this play successful  though  a the wideout also run a perfect route to net get lost coming out of the trip formation or losing any speed getting into the pattern  <BRK> the two play illustrate only a small fraction of what beckham jr  would bring to the table  and why he would fit well into new england s offense  after all  the patriot run similar concept with their x receiver  just think of how they used josh gordon during the eleven game they had him available in    the team did not just use him a a deep threat  he also saw plenty of snap on which he ran in cutting route  beckham jr  would give the patriot a similar skill set  and there is little doubt that josh mcdaniels would not know how to use it  <BRK> odell beckham jr  is one of the nfl s elite wide receiver  and he is paid a such  lat august  he signed a five year     million contract extension with the giant that included a total of    million in guarantee  with the first year of the record setting deal already in the book  the remainder of the extension   which will not carry a signing bonus proration in cae beckham jr  get traded   can be broken down a follows  via over the cap   <BRK> given beckham jr s status a one of the nfl s best wide receiver  his salary cap impact is hefty but actually pretty reaonable for a player of his caliber  to put the number into context  let s take a look at the deal signed by ex patriot brandin cook lat offseaon  cook  of course  wa traded from new england to the los angeles ram in   and subsequently signed to a five year       million extension  <BRK> with the exception of    when beckham jr  would be on a new team s book for a cap number of      million  cook carry a higher salary cap in each of the seaon left on both player  contract  a good of a player a the former patriot is  beckham jr  can be put one tier above him  while new england apparently felt not comfortable keeping cook around with a new contract on the horizon  beckham jr  and his comparatively team friendly contract might alter their approach  <BRK> three more note on the deal not mentioned in the breakdown above  <BRK> top tier wide receiver do not get traded often  but there ha been some movement on that front during the   league year  there are two particular trade to look at in order to find out more about potential compensation for beckham jr  the patriot trading the aforementioned brandin cook to the ram during the offseason  and the oakland raider trading amari cooper to the dallas cowboy near october s trade deadline  <BRK> both the ram and the cowboy gave up first round draft pick to acquire their new wideouts   player whose career output up to that point looked a follows compared to beckham jr s  <BRK> a can be seen  if beckham jr  get traded this offseaon he would be the highest profile of the three player to change team  while he is two year older at the time of a potential move than cook and cooper  his production certainly speaks for itself and his status a one of the nfl s best offensive weapon at this point in his career  seeing the giant ak for more than the first rounder cook and cooper created would therefore not be a surprise  <BRK> what add to this thought is beckham jr s contract situation  while both cook and cooper were dealt while still on their rookie deal and with extension negotiation coming up  beckham jr  already ha a long term contract in place and is bound to it throughout the   seaon  a opposed to especially cooper  who is scheduled to play   on his fifth year option  the ever growing market will not dictate the value of beckham jr s deal for the foreseeable future  <BRK> while he could push for renegotiation once other player jump ahead of him in term of contractual value  the baic framework for the   year old exists a of right now  this in combination with the comparatively team friendly nature of the contract  could make the giant push for the two first rounder they reportedly aked for lat offseaon  whether or not a team   the patriot in this scenario   would actually be willing to pay this is a different question  though  <BRK> new england built it dynaty on the principle of value and maximizing it  baically speaking  it work like this  having four player on      million contract is oftentimes viewed a a better option than having one player make    million  a strong middle clas when it come to roster building is prioritized and ha helped the club stay competitive throughout the year while also allowing it to stay financially flexible to a certain degree  <BRK> of course  the patriot did not strictly bind themselves to this approach a some of their move over the year perfectly illustrate  not only ha the club made some of it player the highest paid at their respective position over the year   the club doe compensate it best player  even though a popular but incorrect asumption claim otherwise   it also ha invested considerable capital in outside reinforcement  <BRK> take the   offseaon  a a recent example  not only did new england trade first and third round draft selection to the new orleans saint to bring in brandin cook and a fourth rounder  the team also signed cornerback stephon gilmore to a five year       million free agency deal one day earlier  the two acquisition were rather surprising at the time a they were noticeable investment by a team more known for it restraint when it come to talent from the outside  <BRK> with those move in mind  the patriot going after beckham jr  would not be entirely out of character for them  if they value a talented player at a certain level and he becomes available at no higher price  new england is not afraid of making a move  and with the team having plenty of capital available   it is projected to own   draft pick this year  with six of them in the top     seeing them come close the giant  demand is not entirely unrealistic  <BRK> the biggest question mark when it come to the patriot potentially trading for odell beckham jr  is the giant  would the team really be willing to part way with it most talented offensive player  would it set the price at the two first round draft selection reported last offseason  and how flexible would it be to alter said price  for example to take a player instead of a first rounder  those three question will likely determine the outcome of trade talk between the two club should they ever occur  <BRK> another factor to keep in mind beyond that is new england s own salary cap situation  the team currently ha  only       million available  with star defensive edge trey flower and left tackle trent brown both headed towards unrestricted free agency  the club would have to create considerable more space in order to keep at least one of their two priority free agent plus acquire a wide receiver with a   cap hit of      million  <BRK> at that point  other question would enter the equation  would beckham jr  be worth what the giant want for him  would having him on the team be significantly better than having some rotational level player like  for instance  dwayne allen and adrian clayborn  two player who would save a combined      million if cut   would new england even be willing to part way with one let alone two first round pick if it come to that  <BRK> given his comparatively team friendly deal  tremendous scheme fit and the patriot  history of acquiring high end talent   yes  is not that unrealistic of an answer to all three of the question  and while we are at it  the one raised around     word ago therefore also can be answered  the patriot trading for odell beckham jr  is a realistic scenario all aspect considered  whether this actually mean it will happen is anyone s guess  though  <BRK>
