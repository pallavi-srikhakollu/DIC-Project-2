manny pacquiao dominated adrien broner in their surprisingly entertaining main event of a showtime boxing card on saturday  pacquiao  in his first bout since turning   year old  retained his wba world welterweight title with a unanimous decision victory <BRK>pacquiao looked much faster than he ha in recent fight  showcasing his style of amazing angle combined with flurry of punch to consistently overwhelm broner  compared to how he s looked in his last two or three fight  pacquiao once again looked like the dominant champion he once wa <BRK>he worked the body early and often  while broner played a game that wa purely defensive  depending on his counter punching  he did get some of those counter punch in  but not nearly enough to make it that close of a bout  going into the championship round  broner arguably only took one of the previous ten round <BRK>now sitting at       for his career  the question becomes  what s next for pacquiao  many have been talking about a potential rematch with floyd mayweather jr   and pacquiao  for his part  showed plenty to make that seem probable going forward <BRK>

early  and a counter right hook  then he eats a body shot and a right hook over the top  and then another big body shot  broner keep looking at the clock  and nearly eats a hook that would have taken his head off  broner with a good straight right  but pacquiao continues to swarm  broner now trying to avoid a much a possible  pacquiao dive in with a left to the body  and a winging left hook that just miss  broner survives to the final round <BRK>round    pacquiao ha some swelling under his eye  but he s still looking fresh out there  while broner isn t engaging  another hook to the body from pacquiao  straight left up top for pacquiao  this round is very inactive a broner spends most of his time running away  not a good look for him  this will be pacquiao or somebody made a very bad mistake <BRK>round    browne uncorks the first big shot  trying for a massive right hook  but jack block the bulk of it  they tie up  and jack ands a short shot to the body  browne go with a three punch combo  two of which go to the body and land  left straight over the top from browne  then a short right hook  though jack defends them well  hook to the body from jack  browne is throwing with serious power  which could be a factor if this one go the distance  short hook to the body and a big right hook upstairs from browne  it s a slow start for jack  but there s  probably  a lot of fight left <BRK>round    big right over the top from jack after another feelingout period  straight to the body from jack  browne land some strong shot to the body  and work the jab  this one slowed down a lot in the second round  ntot a whole lot going on  it s probably browne s round just because he wa more active <BRK>round    three punch combo from browne  again  and all three land  including two big body shot  hard body shot from jack  who then miss with a slow right hook  the jab fake followed by a big followup hook just miss for jack  jack get browne against the rope and work the body with a few hard punch  another hard body shot for jack  who is doing a good job of getting in and out  he push browne to the rope again and land a few short body shot  definitely jack s best round thus far <BRK>round    browne is getting a bit more aggressive  at least to start this fourth round  he come forward and go to the body several time in the first minute  jack get a counter left in there occasionally  but browne is putting the pressure on  he ha jack backing up for much of this round <BRK>round    jack tie up early  and is separated  the referee warns jack for holding  and warns him a

punch  he connects with a body shot  then a big left hook  jack look tired and this one may be over soon if he keep fighting like that <BRK>round    jack land two hard body shot  and when he go up top  browne tie him up this time  and they re separated  the referee is getting sick of the holding and both corner have been warned multiple time  browne with a nice high low combination  jack ha stepped it up and he s throwing  but browne is the faster  more powerful striker right now <BRK>round    jack come forward throwing hard  with two big hook  one of which land hard up top  brown responds with a strong punch to the body  but jack walk him into the rope and connects on a few short body shot of his own  browne is weathering the storm  but he tie up multiple time  and the referee take a point away from browne  jack initiated about a dozen more tie ups than browne  but browne get the point taken away  jack ha a cut on his face that s leaking blood <BRK>round    jack land two hard right hand up top  then a short hook to the body  browne tag jack with a hard hook to the jaw  browne wing two hook  massive hook on either side of jack s face  and the blood is just leaking from his head  jack probably can t see very well  this one slows down in the latter half of the round  but browne most certainly took it <BRK>round    browne is definitely going for that cut on jack s forehead  he wa focusing a lot on the body previously  but now he s getting the jab out there far more  trying to get it flowing to block jack s vision  jack is turtling  covering up his face  and there really is no room for offense from him  browne is just peppering his glove and occasionally grazing jack s face  which is enough at the moment  <BRK>round    browne come out firing  but he get turned around in the corner and jack ha a burst of offense  peppering him with jab and hook  browne weather the storm and get out of it  but jack keep up the pressure for much of the round  he certainly doesn t look tired anymore  but he doesn t connect with anything big round    browne come forward again  throwing hard jab a jack try to protect himself  the fight is stopped briefly so jack can be examined by the doctor  because his face is entirely coated in blood  they resume fighting  and browne go back to the jab with short hook  jack land a hard right hook that may have staggered browne  and we re heading to round   <BRK>round    jack land another hard hook  and browne is backing up immediately  he tie up  right now  browne is in survival mode  trying to get to the judge because jack is throwing everything he ha  short left straight from browne land up top  body shot from jack  short right uppercut from jack land  but browne should have this a the fight end <BRK>round    oubaali try for some quick jab to the body  and miss with a huge overhand that warren circle away from  warren quickly get to flicking his right jab out there  trying to establish it early  right hand to the body from oubaali  but it just graz  hard left hook from warren  then two hard jab over the top and a third to the body  oubaali is throwing a lot  pressing the pace  but warren is keeping himelf out of danger  oubaali pressure warren into the corner  and warren eats a hard right a he s escaping  warren throw several jab after that  very good first round  but it s hard to call it either way <BRK>round    oubaali is just trying to keep his hand out there   he s throwing a ton of punch  many of which aren t landing  but he s doing a good job of controlling the pace  warren is looking a little gunshy a oubaali throw so much  left hook from warren miss  but he doe get back to the right jab  backing oubaali up  warren come in  trying to take the center of the ring  but he eats a stiff counter right  and then another one  and he stumble briefly  he definitely took some serious damage there  but the round end <BRK>round    hard right jab from warren  and oubaali hit him with a short counter left  oubaali get warren against the rope and connects with a right hook and a big jab  right hook to the body from oubaali a warren get out of the corner and away from the rope  oubaali come forward with some wild hook  getting warren against the rope again and teeing off  but warren doe some good avoiding this time  and get out of the way  and now in the final second we have a brawl  with both fighter swinging counter hook  warren may have got the better of these latter exchange  with both landing hard shot  but it s still probably oubaali s round <BRK>round    warren come out looking to do some damage after a rough round  he connects with a jab to the body  then a follow up up top  big right hook from warren up top  and then he avoids a hard jab from oubaali  overhand left from oubaali land  high action round  though nobody took a ton of damage <BRK>round    warren continues to try and take the center of the ring  and oubaali ha stopped throwing with the same amount of gusto a earlier round  warren miss a winging right hook voer the top  and land a hard left hook to the body a oubaali throw a counter over the top  big left hand from oubaali miss  but the follow up jab combo is good  two masive right hook from oubaali land and back warren up big time <BRK>round    big right hook from oubaali to start the round  but he whiff on a straight left to the body  he eats two hook for his trouble  then a hard jab  and then another  counter left for oubaali land  but warren responds with two big right hook  big flurry right near the end of the round  with warren landing body shot and oubaali connecting up top  this one is really close <BRK>round    warren s jab are doing some real work in these latter round  he stagger oubaali with a stiff jab  but oubaali come forward

warren survives the storm and make it to the round without going down <BRK>round    warren come out a bit slow  he s probably still feeling that late push from oubaali  big right hook from oubaali land and warren ha to figure out this punch  oubaali ha connected multiple time with it  and again  warren is losing ground fast in this bout <BRK>round    big jab from warren  then another  and oubaali pause his onslaught for the moment  warren s jab remains a deterrent  but oubaali is not absorbing much damage with three round to go  short right hook from warren connects up top  two hard body shot from oubaali  then warren throw a three punch combo  but eats another one of oubaali s hard counter  right on the chin  warren is responding to oubaali s pressure well  but the pressure is still effective  if this go to the scorecard  somebody is going to be upset <BRK>round    oubaali come forward this time  and he connects with a couple stiff jab  warren is a bit more inactive through the first half of this round  warren duck a massive hook from oubaali  and get tagged with a short left hook  he throw a hard jab of his own  the two are letting go and swinging a lot more than the previous round now  with oubaali landing the better of the shot <BRK>round    more jab from warren  huge left hook from warren is ducked by warren  who throw one of his own  and it s partially blocked by oubaali  hard left to the body from oubaali  three big shot over the top land for oubaali  and warren once again slowed down in the back half of this round  he s not sitting down on his punch and

a short uppercut  but eats a one two from ruiz and is dropped to the mat early in the first round  they tie up and are separated  with ruizl nading some very hard body shot in the process  guevara

ruiz  hard body shot from ruiz  ruiz step right into a stiff jab from guevara  and eats a follow up punch that did some damage from guevara  left jab from ruiz <BRK>round    ruiz s biggest issue
