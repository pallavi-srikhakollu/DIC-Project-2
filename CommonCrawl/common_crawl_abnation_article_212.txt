rumor of the death of new orleans saint offense are greatly exaggerated   <BRK> just look at this graphic from fox sport one s colin cowherd  <BRK>  saintsforecast  andrewjuge offense ha to be better  yes i m worried  pic twitter com  w culi c <BRK> misleading graphic much  to quote our friend  mark ingram   look at the detail   <BRK> for one  look at the text under  remaining team   it say   since week   with starting qb   why week    no reaon in particular  why  with starting qb   because they re trying to be fair and exclude the game drew brees didn t play in week    that mean for the saint  you re looking at a three game sample size  week    week    and the divisional round   for the other three team  it s a four game sample size  a each starting qb played in week   for those club  and each ha only had one playoff game thus far  <BRK> but let s take a look at some of those detail behind the number  <BRK> for one  in week    of the four team listed above  the saint were the only team to actually go on and win their game  the chief lost   at home   to the los angeles charger  the ram lost   at home    to the philadelphia eagle  the new orleans saint played on the road at carolina  and beat the panther  the patriot were the only other of the four team to play on the road  and they lost to the pittsburgh steelers  <BRK> in week    that same steelers team that beat the patriot the week before  took the  l  against the saint back home in the dome  the chief lost back to back game  this time to the seattle seahawks on the road  sure  the patriot and ram were able to win their game  but it wa against the mighty juggernaut arizona cardinal and buffalo bill  <BRK> week   is largely irrelevant for the graphic because drew brees and the starting saint offense didn t play  outside of michael thomas   but this graphic includes the game from the other three team  again  sure  those team won  but the chief  patriot  and ram faced off against the raider  jet  and  er respectively  it s not like they were putting up big number against world beater  <BRK> yes  the new orleans saint  only  put up   point of offense up against the philadelphia eagle in the divisional round  understand  though  that the ram offense  an offense the graphic is not trying to dismiss   only  put up   point against that same eagle team  at home in week    in a loss  <BRK> the saint offense did enough to win the game last week  and they played exactly the type of game they needed to to win  after the momentum swung back to the saint midway through the second quarter  the saint absolutely dominated the ball  the eagle could do nothing on offense  and the saint offense wa able to wear out the philadelphia defense  on the back of an   play scoring drive to take the lead in the third quarter  the saint offense held the ball for a whopping   minute and   second  the saint didn t want to  or have to  score quickly in hope of winning a shootout  they played exactly the game they wanted to play  <BRK> in the ram  loss to the eagle in week    the ram   who scored   point   held the ball for only      that is half of an entire quarter of football le than the saint in the divisional round  the ram offense couldn t put in work against the eagle defense  couldn t sustain drive  and couldn t come out with the win   <BRK> i know the law of syllogism  if a   b  and b   c  then a   c  doesn t apply in the nfl  just because team a beat team b  and team b beat team c  doesn t not guarantee team a will beat team c  but consider this  <BRK> the vaunted  bear defense held nick foles and the eagle offense to   point at home in the divisional round  the  saint were even better  holding phi to only   point sunday  that same bear d held the ram offense to only   pt just over a month ago  <BRK> the saint defense wa able to do something the chicago bear defense  for all their credit  couldn t do  hold the eagle offense to under   point at home  granted  weather wa a factor  but those same bear held the ram offense to only   point at home in week    yeah  cowherd didn t include week   in his graphic   if the saint defense can perform in the playoff to the same caliber a the bear  why couldn t the saint run a similar game plan against la a they did against philadelphia   dominate on defense and control time of possession  <BRK> frankly  i m not worried at this point about the chief and patriot  only one of them will make the super bowl  and the saint have to beat the ram before that even matter  but a far a the ram go  ram fan   not saint fan    should be the one worried about the saint offense  <BRK>
