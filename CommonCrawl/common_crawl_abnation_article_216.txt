the los angeles ram are headed to atlanta for super bowl liii after beating the new orleans saint in the nfc championship on sunday       it wa a close game that went to overtime  and one that wa marred by poor decision making  for both team  and poor officiating  <BRK> new orleans got out to an early     lead thanks to a pair of field goal and a touchdown  but the ram quickly responded before the end of the first half  making it     going into halftime  much of the game wa a battle for field position  and the ram frequently had to work with le a the saint largely won that battle  <BRK> but even working with that field position  the ram kept battling back  down three point and starting from their own   yard line  they drove down the field late in the fourth quarter to tie the game at   point apiece  giving the ball back to the saint with five minute left in the game  <BRK> they managed to kick a field goal for the lead  but they also did a horrible job of managing the clock  and instead of giving the ram the ball back with under a minute to go  they only took about   second off following the two minute warning  that allowed the ram to come back and kick a field goal to force overtime  <BRK> to be fair to the saint  there wa also an incredibly bad call by the referee  who missed one of the most blatant example pa interference i ve personally ever seen  if they get that call  they probably kneel it out and kick a field goal a time expires  instead  they went to overtime  <BRK> in overtime  the saint received and brees had a pas tipped at the line before it wa intercepted by john johnson  the ram then moved into field goal range  right on the cusp of it  and had a   yard attempt for greg zuerlein  he made it  and the ram are going to the super bowl  <BRK>
