football is maybe the most stat unfriendly sport in the universe  and it s not even becaue of the pointy ball   it s the sample size that kill u more than anything  twelve regular season game in college    in the pro   that s not even   percent of an nba regular season and not even   percent of an mlb season  <BRK> part of my ethos when working with football advanced stats  then  is that you should try to wring meaning out of everything you possibly can  in college  that mean pulling whatever possible from game against fcs competition   there s got to be at least a little we can learn when clemson play furman  right  <BRK> on the pro side  that mean avoiding the narrative that take over in very specific  very small sample instance  team a stink in the red zone because of this one drive in the playoff last year  that s not good enough  coach b can t win the big one because of this one game two year ago  not going down that road  <BRK> that all sound great and noble  and then the patriot go and utterly destroy the charger  <BRK> on paper  there wa no basis for new england s easy win over los angeles in last week s afc divisional round  throughout the regular season  the charger were the statistically superior team in about every possible way but special team  never mind the narrative   philip river ha never beaten tom brady  the playoff patriot are infinitely superior to the playoff charger  etc  los angeles had the better team  and that wa what mattered most right  <BRK> it didn t matter in the slightest a new england played a perfect first half and leading     at halftime  it didn t matter a pat fan yelled to yank tom brady and company for the reserve in the fourth quarter   very clemson furman behavior right there  <BRK> i could tell you that kansa city  which host new england in what should be a frigid arrowhead stadium on sunday evening      p m  et  cbs   ha easily been the superior team over the first   week of the   season  but will that matter one game from the super bowl  or are the narrative more powerful after all  <BRK> should we dive into the stats at all  or should we save energy and assume that the playoff team led by bill belichick will down the playoff team led by andy reid and that tom brady  with his five super bowl ring and eight afc title  will have more than enough guile to get past the enthusiastic but playoff unproven  first year starter on the opposite sideline  <BRK> for the moment  humor me  let s pretend that stats matter and see what we can glean from them  <BRK>

   <BRK> kansa city s aforementioned first year starting quarterback ha been a revelation this season  and he s likely to have to build a trophy case in this coming offseason  <BRK> for all of the justifiable talk about how nfl offense have begun to evolve in    and how the quote unquote  college offense  ha begun to infiltrate the pro game  a lot of kansa city s extraordinary success this fall ha simply come from mahomes  pure athletic skill  his arm talent  if you will  he can stretch the field vertically better than anyone else  and he s got help from maybe the fastest target in the league  tyreek hill  <BRK> that open up option   it creates space for both tight end travis kelce and open up wide running lane for check down to running back on the perimeter  reid and offensive coordinator eric bieniemy have been able to get creative in both taking advantage of that duo and the counter that come when defense attempt to adapt to a devastating base offense  <BRK> mahomes is merely good when he s under pressure  though  <BRK> this is a pretty cool chart  danieltkelley made    pic twitter com uhgqv gp  <BRK> per pff s pressure data  mahomes is better than drew brees when kept clean but is worse than matthew stafford when harried  great  so pressure him then  easy  right  not if you re the patriot  the regular season patriot  anyway  <BRK> kansa city s offense ha been infinitely more effective in obvious blitz situation than new england s defense  even with mahomes  merely decent pressure number  but the patriot didn t look like a feckless blitz down defense last weekend  <BRK> new england wa able to render los angeles one dimensional   charger back combined for just   yard on   carry   and then pin it collective ear back  river wa sacked twice and hurried seven time  he wa forced to throw the ball away on several occasion  and when he didn t  he wa throwing before charger receiver could get separation  the result  one interception and eight total pass defensed  <BRK> this wa everything new england wan t in the regular seaon  the patriot were well rested and had an extra week to prepare for the charger  and it showed  but can they remain a creative and effective this week at arrowhead  <BRK> part of that question will be answered by how well the patriot can contain the kansa city run game  <BRK> kansa city s offense isn t quite a effective a it wa before the midseaon dismissal of running back kareem hunt  but in part because of the other preoccupying threat they posse  and in part because of a great offensive line  the chief still run the ball pretty well  they certainly did in similarly frigid condition lat week against the colt  when damien williams carried   time for   yard      per carry  and a touchdown  <BRK> mahomes averaged just     yard per completion againt indy s great big play prevention defense  but thanks to steady gain via both run and pas  kansa city wa able to work efficiently and hog the ball  ending up with   snap to indy s    <BRK> the chief are great at the sexy big play  and they ve got an inexperienced qb leading the way  but you can t really bait them into taking foolish chance  mahomes will take what s given to him  and kansa city will score point because of it  but if the patriot can get after him when they get the rare opportunity  their own offensive advantage could take over  <BRK> the key for both defense   and really  every defense in the league in every game  if we re being honest   is pressuring the opposing qb when it ha the chance  the chief  defense is great at this  much better  in fact  than new england s  but their problem is that they have been abysmal at actually creating these chance  <BRK> see if you can spot the biggest mismatch  <BRK> in open play situation   the snap that take place between the offense s   and the defense s    i e  the majority of a given game    kansa city s defense rank a ghastly  st in both marginal efficiency and the percentage of opponent first down allowed before third down  new england s offense rank sixth in the former and first in the latter  <BRK> there wa a great viral video floating around this week  with brady and charger end joey bosa showing mutual respect for each other and bosa complaining that brady get the ball out too fast for a pas rush to get to him  <BRK> mutual respect on both side of the ball  jbbigbear and tom brady recognize each other s game    charger    nflmicdup pic twitter com  osir ifc <BRK> this is a bit misleading  though  it suggests that brady wa just too good in pas rush situation  and while that s true  the charger  biggest issue on sunday wa that they simply couldn t force pas rush situation  <BRK> an inability to force third and longs ha been kansa city s fatal flaw since the beginning of the season  and it wa certainly an issue in a     loss in foxborough in week    in that game  the patriot both a  converted   percent of their third down attempt  kansa city    percent  and b  generated   first down before third down altogether  kc      rookie back sony michel rushed for   yard  and that wa before his late season improvement  he s averaging     yard per carry over his last three game   <BRK> the weather condition will make this a different game for any number of reason  but kansa city simply must figure out a way to knock new england off schedule and give an excellent pas rush a chance to make a difference  <BRK> to their credit  they did an incredible job of this against indianapolis lat week   the colt generated only   pre third first down and went   for   on third down  average distance      yard   but a good a andrew luck is  and a good a the colt were late in the year  we re talking about the playoff patriot here  <BRK> according to dvoa  only the jet had a better special team unit than kansa city this year  place kicker harrison butker wa perfect on field goal under   yard and went   for   beyond    and he wa the weakest link of the unit  tyreek hill  punt  and tremon smith  kickoff  are a terrifying pair of return men  and little used punter dustin colquitt wa a steady a ever this seaon  too  <BRK> thanks to the combination of special team and extreme offensive efficiency  the chief are an incredible field position team  and the early field position battle could be telling on sunday  when you ve got an iffy playoff history  to put it kindly  and you re facing probably the best playoff qb of all time  tilting the field in your favor is one way to alleviate some tension  kansa city might not win this game with a field position advantage  but the chief might find it impossible to win this game without one  <BRK> during the regular season  kansa city posted not only the second best scoring margin in the league but also created one of the smallest standard deviation  meaning that despite potential hindrance   first year starting quarterback  steadily bad defense   the ups and down were minimal  they lost some game  sure  but everyone doe  they were a pretty safe bet overall  <BRK> new england  not so much  <BRK> new england won seven of it   game by at leat two touchdown but also lost by   to tennessee  by   to detroit  and by   to jacksonville  average point scored in these game       and let a pretty spectacular set of miscue lead to a loss in the most memorable finish of the regular seaon  their top gear is a strong a it s been in a while  but they have stalled out sometimes a well  <BRK> we saw the top gear last weekend  it s easy to assume we ll see it again on sunday   playoff patriot and all  but on paper  new england wa drastically unstable  i m pointing this out on the off chance that i get to pound my chest and point it out again late on sunday evening  <BRK> kansa city actually won a home playoff game last weekend  ending a six game and   year slide  now come the stiffest test imaginable  a patriot team that ha won all the playoff game that the chief haven t in this century  and an offense perfectly built to punish the chief  defensive weakness and avoid their strength  <BRK> last week  i wrote that philip river had his best opportunity ever to beat brady and company and even predicted it to happen  and then the playoff patriot showed up and rendered that prediction woefully inaccurate  basically any projection system you choose is going to pick kansa city to win  but i ve learned my lesson  and it s time to overcorrect  if i m wrong this week  it ll come from overestimating the pat  not underestimating them  <BRK> prove me wrong  home team  <BRK>
