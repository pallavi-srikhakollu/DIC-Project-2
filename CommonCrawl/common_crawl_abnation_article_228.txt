to figure out what s gone wrong lately  first it s necessary to actually define the play of the maple leaf in term of something le random than goal  <BRK>it go very much against my nature to look at a chunk of game result in isolation from the whole season  there is a natural tendency to think that the direction the line graph of your life is going will continue  the future will be just like now only more so  but in hockey  like life  ups and down are natural and just happen  and there is no explanation for why that is that is fit for airing other than on a sportsnet panel  <BRK>but this situation the leaf are in right now might warrant a serious look at how the last x number of game differs from the season average  solving for x is the first job  i could just pick the number that make the team now look the worst  but i m not composing a tweet that can end in the word  yikes   so i ll have to try something else  <BRK>to avoid that bit of algebra  i ll start instead with the seaon average a a team  <BRK>note  all number in this post are from offside review  five on five and score adjusted unless otherwise stated <BRK>to date  the leaf are <BRK>from that  we can see thing we should already know  but i ll repeat them <BRK>while we should know all that  i m not sure that s the narrative that is attached to the  bad defensive team    i would state it a a team that executes acceptably defensively  but fails to drive play effectively  so the corsi percentage is okay  not great  but the masive pace of shot against is more than offset by the pace of shot for and the offensive and defensive execution  <BRK>the slightly poor overall offensive quality should not matter given good enough shot share  cf    it s worth it looking at who ha low xgf  to see who on the team is driving that below average offence  <BRK>the worst offensive player by this measure are everyone who ha ever played fourth line  including that guy you like and all the newbie like trevor moore  connor brown is in this group  so when he play more minute  he negatively affect the quality of shot for  <BRK>next worst are all the defencemen who are not morgan rielly and jake gardiner  which is normal <BRK>mixed in with the defencemen is nazem kadri  andreas johnsson  and patrick marleau   <BRK>at the top are <BRK>it took me so long to get here  i m just going to pick the lat   game a a number out of the air and note the difference  and that set the start date for the recent pat at february   <BRK>i m surprised at the total lack of slippage on xga  given the worsening shot share  but the leaf have managed to deal with that decline in shot share by improving the quality of their shot against just enough to stay where they ve been all year by this measure <BRK>what is happening to the offence is that the reduced time spent in the offensive zone is showing up in fewer overall chance to score  the main difference in this   game compared to the whole season is the lower corsi for percentage which magnifies all the weakness and dilutes the effectiveness of the offence <BRK>over these   game  the actual fenwick save percentage is just a hair below expected  while on the season it is several hair above  overall the goaltending ha been above average  but it ha been just barely below for the last   game  <BRK>the player with notable drop in on ice xgf  are nazem kadri  he s only played seven game in this set  and kaperi kapanen  andrea johnsson ha gone up a he s played exclusively with better linemates  <BRK>the top two line are performing at their season average in offensive quality  it s everyone else who is just a little bit crappy right now  with the bulk of the  blame  going to the kadri line  <BRK>sorry  that took so long  but without all that preliminary understanding  we might a well just talk about who smile too much <BRK>gardiner only played five game in that set of   i considered above  but prior to that he played the most five on five minute of any player on the team  i ve covered this extensively in the past  but gardiner played all the important high leverage situation   a meaningful measure of tough minute  his corsi for percentage is    his expected goal percentage is   which lead the team  <BRK>you cannot take a big minute  highly successful player out of the lineup and shrug it off  his absence is most of the reason for the shot share slippage from the twin effect of removing his ability and tasking other  lesser defender with more  and tougher minute  <BRK>the loss of dermott is a subset of the gardiner problem  just le serious  simply because he played the exact opposite type of minute to gardiner  but his result were excellent  and replacing him with martin marincin is a step down  in addition  not having him available to play some of gardiner s time  which he is clearly capable of doing  just magnified the loss of gardiner  <BRK>on the season  kadri is one of the highest corsi for percentage forward on the team  he win the line matchup he s given most of the time and delivers a lot of positive zone time  in the seven game he played in the set of   above  he s been an appalling   per cent  with only the dreadful frederik gauthier worse than that amongst forward  <BRK>conversely  while kadri s slow return from a concussion ha hurt the shot share  a healthy kadri doesn t bring meaningful offence  or more properly  his line doesn t  he s spent a lot of awful minute playing with connor brown  who add no offensive value  or patrick marleau  who is kind of meh in about the same way kadri himself ha been  he s also played with par lindholm  who wa worse than brown on balance  and william nylander and kasperi kapanen  a pair of winger who likely need a sniper to feed  <BRK>the ideal for the leaf this seaon wa to roll three scoring line and have two out of the three dominate every game  the depth in forward talent just isn t there at the moment to make that happen  not and cover for injury a well  the result ha been only partly successful  and kadri ha been relied on more to just keep the opposition s second line in check  which he s done very well  but that s all he s done  and he han t been doing that since his return <BRK>no one get great stats in le than eight minute a night  and no one get any wiser analysing a fourth line that barely play  the only issue here is that in order to mitigate how bad defensively gauthier is  and how terrible he is at driving play  the line ha to be shoved out on the fly heading to the offensive zone  they do a decent job of finishing in the offensive zone and allowing a change to the matthew line  but they can t create an offensive faceoff from a defensive faceoff start  being able to give those nice shift start to meaningful player would help <BRK>they are all really bad at driving play  the pace of shot against allowed when nikita zaitsev  ron hainsey and morgan rielly are on the ice in the most recent   game is astonishingly bad  jake muzzin is merely awful  <BRK>the third pairing guy look good because of usage similar to the fourth line s like they have all year <BRK>now  consider which forward are on the ice when the top four defender are out there getting hemmed in and unable to transition the play  and you have a perfect storm of offensively gifted forward who execute poorly in the defensive zone and defencemen playing above their head who don t drive play  a soon a you stop driving play  that dilutes the offence  and it doesn t matter how lucky you re shooting if you re not shooting enough <BRK>the highest shooting percentage in the last   game belongs to gauthier  hainsey is second  every top six forward other than marner is below   per cent  matthew is at   per cent  shooting percentage fluctuate over the course of the season  and the top six is not playing worse offensively  they just can t buy a goal <BRK>suck right now <BRK>the leaf have the best power play in the nhl by expected goal per    don t tell me the success percentage  i don t care  they are also top in corsi for per    so they re getting more chance in those rare occasion when they have a power play  <BRK>by expected shooting percentage  the leaf drop to sixth in the nhl but the gap is le than one percentage point  so they re in the elite group  <BRK>in the last   game  they ve slid a very small amount in expected goal per    about what you d expect with the jake swap on the second unit and some time missed by kadri  it s not the problem  but it s not helping either  <BRK>i ve heard both of these blame narrative  dubas only like soft player  and babcock only play old guy  personally  i think kyle dubas and mike babcock are in it together  <BRK>i think kyle dubas set out to build a team on speed and skill  and he started with what he had to work with and added more of the same  would he have liked a better defender in trade than muzzin  sure  wa there one for the price paid  nope  and muzzin is doing fine  by the way  he just ain t jake  okay  he is jake  but you know what i mean <BRK>babcock  way back in the world cup  took a team of fast  skilled shooter and did not play the tight defensive style everyone wa used to seeing from him  he let them fly  i have always believed he wa getting ready to coach a team full of small  zippy  skilled shooter and a number one defender in morgan rielly who is really terrible at doing anything to prevent shot against  mo ain t changing now  so it s not like the leaf will magically morph into a team whose top d is victor hedman  <BRK>team canada wan t the speed kill lunacy of team north america  but a more responsible and mature version  the leaf right now are tna only missing some key player and unlucky in shooting  and that s really  really frustrating  when a tight defensive team come along that is counting on one or two player for all the offence  leaving all the rest of them to be nothing but stick in lane and obstruction  legal and not   the revved engine of speed and skill can look horrible a part start to fall of  and the tire blowout   <BRK>i ll let you decide if i mean team europe there or the boston bruin  <BRK>is this style built around the existing core of the team really dumb <BRK>ask the tampa bay lightning  if you want a low event  low risk hockey that loses     instead of     when it all go to hell  you re in the wrong place  and morgan rielly is the wrong  d  <BRK>in some way  what the leaf do is very high risk  but what dubas is doing is extremely conservative  he s building in a lot more redundancy to the forward corp and the defensive depth than most team have while we all wait for those better defensive prospect to mature  <BRK>time  luck  and hard work  because a much a i hate building eye test narrative  it s really clear that some member of the team have been frustrated into inactivity defensively  i don t for one second buy into the story that any member of this team isn t trying  <BRK>think of the thing you re kind of bad at but really have to do sometimes  now take away the man who help you the most  take away his nearest equivalent  and then see how you get along  that s auston matthew right now in the defensive zone  i console myself with the knowledge that he s got the strongest will of any player on the team  so he ll bullhead his way out of this  <BRK>kadri will be more like himself  kapanen will be back  and so will travis dermott <BRK>ten more game and then playoff  and all anyone can do is what they can do the best they know how <BRK>go leaf go <BRK><BRK>
