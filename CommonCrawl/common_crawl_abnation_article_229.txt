kyler murray picked football over baseball  the brown signed kareem hunt  who is still awaiting punishment from the nfl  antonio brown bid steelers fan farewell  though he remains on the team   the raven traded joe flacco to the bronco  there s a guy named poop johnson in the cfl <BRK>this week served a yet another reminder that there is no offseaon in football  that s even more true this year now that the aaf is here <BRK>we shouldn t expect that to change  either  there are no shortage of question we ll get answer to in next few month  who will get the franchise tag  can brown and the steelers make up  will gronk retire  how small exactly is murray  where will free agent to be like earl thomas and nick foles end up  will the nfl tweak it rule to avoid another saint like disaster <BRK>we ll be following all of those situation closely   maybe more closely than we care to admit in public  but there are a few other underrated storyline that we think deserve more attention  here are our four favorite this offseason <BRK>bell is finally going to be a free agent  it only took four year on a rookie contract  one year on the franchise tag  and a second year on the franchise tag that wa negated by bell sitting on the sideline for an entire season <BRK>but he   probably   made it <BRK>it ll be interesting to see which team will pay up for bell  he s a three time pro bowler who ha averaged     rushing yard and     receiving yard per game over his career  even marshall faulk   the all time king of pas catching running back   averaged     rushing yard and     receiving yard during his hall of fame career <BRK>but it ll be even more interesting to see what bell get <BRK>bell hit uncharted territory in    plenty of player have held out after the franchise tag took away their chance to see the free agent market  a few have even missed regular season game  but bell sat out an entire season even when  by rule  it didn t have a chance at actually landing him a new contract from the steelers <BRK>wa it all worth it  <BRK>it ll be hard for him to stomach his long saga with the steelers if he can t find a deal that come close to the    million per year average that todd gurley got last summer  maybe he ll eclipse that and get a record breaking deal for a running back  <BRK>in the long term  bell s fight may prove to be a helpful battle for all nfl player  regardless of his contract   especially if it help eliminate the franchise tag  either way  it ll be an interesting valuation of a player who put his foot down and strong armed his way to the open market  <BRK>punxsutawney phil saw his shadow  the patriot won a super bowl  and mock draft started popping up everywhere  like clockwork  that meant it wa time for beckham jr  trade rumor  <BRK>you didn t think those rumor would go away after the giant made him the highest paid receiver in the nfl lat year  did you  or after he re established himself a the giant  no    receiver  putting up     receiving yard and six touchdown   and throwing two more    in   game this pat seaon <BRK>nope  because here we go again  what got this idea back on everyone s radar again wa jay glazer s mailbag for the athletic  in the column  glazer obliged a reader who requested a bold prediction with <BRK>i predict odell beckham jr  get traded this off season  i think that s bold enough <BRK>and obj heard about that pretty quickly <BRK>   <BRK>and  judging by glazer s followup tweet  it got a lot of people s attention <BRK>for all you fucksticks who spewed shit at me  my kid  my mom  my mom s kid  my kid s mom  my head size  body size  intelligence  my mom s intelligence all because i made a prediction about your team today save your ridiculous fuckin insult for shit that matter in life <BRK>well   fucksticks  is an underappreciated cuss word   let s all agree on that point <BRK>but yeaaaaah  these beckham rumor make even le sense now than they ever did before  beckham  along with saquon barkley and whichever quarterback the giant draft this year  will make for a young  dynamic offensive trio that the team can build around  new york could use more cap space  but trading beckham wouldn t free up that much money  if the giant would want to dump anyone  it should be eli manning  which would save the team    million  <BRK>the giant probably won t do that  but at least it d be more understandable to part with a   year old quarterback on his last leg than with a   year old superstar receiver  <BRK>a it should be  the giant are still the betting favorite for where beckham will play this fall <BRK>odds for what team  obj will be on for week   of the   nfl regular season  betonline  giant   er   raider   dolphin   steeler   cardinal   jet   patriot   bill   cowboy   brown   bear    http   t co  hwgesfjv <BRK>but the nfl world like drama  so obj rumor probably aren t going away anytime soon  rather than bemoan it  we should just embrace the absurdity of it all   and hope that we see a few more people use the word  fucksticks  <BRK>steve wilks lasted only one season in the desert giving way to     deposed texas tech head coach kliff kingsbury  this is a sentence for which a new form of punctuation   some kind of exclamation point  question mark  and cry laughing emoji  ideally   need to be invented  this alone would make arizona amazing to follow  but there s more <BRK>there s so much more <BRK>the cardinal have a budding quarterback  josh rosen  who is le than a year removed from being the no    pick of the   nfl draft  he might be hung out to dry because kingsbury once made some glowing comment about a rival passer from oklahoma who wasn t supposed to go to the nfl  arizona say it s committed to developing rosen  but oddsmakers don t believe that one bit  the card have the second best odds of drafting heisman trophy winner kyler murray this spring  <BRK>the weirdness isn t contained solely on the offensive side of the ball  all pro cornerback patrick peterson demanded a trade in hope of removing the red albatross from his neck  then rescinded that trade month later after hitting his tee shot on the  th hole at the phoenix open <BRK>peterson officially rescinds his trade request from last season after sticking his tee shot at    phoenixopen pic twitter com ziecevpc v<BRK>now he s working to recruit another disgruntled player  steelers wideout antonio brown  to glendale <BRK>then you ve got david johnson  who broke into the league a one of the league s most exciting player and then spent the lat two seaons ritualistically sacrificing fantay team due to injury and ineffectiveness  player like ricky seal jones  chad williams  and trent sherfield  who wa kinda good   round out the most depressing nfl blitz roster ever constructed <BRK>and finally  on a heartwarming breaking ending  there s larry fitzgerald  playing out what what may be the final year of a hall of fame career  aw   making    million  yay   and playing for what may be a four win team  boo   bless this mess that is the entirely non sensical   arizona cardinal  if they win the super bowl it will be counted a a sign of the apocalypse <BRK>one of the more recent draft trend we ve seen is team trading up for a quarterback in the first round  the collective bargaining agreement that wa ratified in   lowered the amount of money that player at the top of the draft would receive  making the pick a smaller portion of each team s cap space <BRK>that made it easier for team to move up in the draft to select player that they wanted  most notably  quarterback prospect  trading up for quarterback ha ratcheted up even more in recent year  since the   draft when jared goff and carson wentz went first and second  only one first round quarterback han t been drafted involving a trade   that wa baker mayfield  the first overall pick to the     cleveland brown last year <BRK>

  <BRK>there are going to be team that will trade up for a quarterback this year because there are every year  the new york giant  jacksonville jaguar  denver bronco  and miami dolphin are four team who could be in the quarterback market this year  <BRK>the giant and jaguar probably have the easiest avenue to get the quarterback prospect they want   likely ohio state s dwayne haskins   because they have the sixth and seventh pick in the draft  it wouldn t cost too much for them to leapfrog into the top three pick from where they currently sit  if they find a quarterback prospect that they fall in love with and don t want to miss out on  sacrificing a few draft pick is worth the risk <BRK>
