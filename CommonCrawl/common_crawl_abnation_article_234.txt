there s good news and bad news if you re an nfl team in need of a veteran quarterback in    the good news is there s a wide array of option available in what will be a buyer s market  the bad news is it s a flawed market  with not so much a a kirk cousin type impact player to be found <BRK>this offseaon s spinning wheel of incomplete paser includes a pair of super bowl mvp  multiple former first round pick  and one guy who could hang up his cleat and take a job a an nfl qbs coach at any moment    stand to uproot longtime franchise fixture and journeyman alike  and history suggests at leat a couple will play a role in the playoff race  <BRK>so who will end up where  we ve got a few guess <BRK>a big thanks to john elway for making this one easy on me  flacco wan t statistically much better than case keenum  but the denver gm decided it wa worth shipping out a fourth round pick and eating    million in dead cap space to swap out a mediocre   year old quarterback with a mediocre   year old   a deal that will become official on march    the first day of free agency  at least he ll be better than paxton lynch <BRK>the jag  championship window seemingly slammed shut after their breakthrough   gave way to a massive   regression  jacksonville s defense went from  great  to  good   but the team s offense disintegrated like a comet plummeting through the earth s atmosphere <BRK>foles would give an unthreatening offense a super bowl mvp at quarterback  albeit one not exactly known for his consistency  the jaguar have plenty of work to do to fix their scoring engine this offseason  including replacing the bombed out husk of what wa once a promising receiving corp and figuring out what to do with career     yard per carry haver leonard fournette  but with the blake bortles era likely over  the first item on that to do list will be finding a quarterback <BRK>

  <BRK>bridgewater s underwhelming week   performance may scare team away from offering him a starting role  going to tampa bay and playing with jameis winston  however  will earn him several opportunity to earn snap in   and beyond  <BRK>the buccaneer have to figure out what to do with winston  who finished   on a high note but got outplayed by ryan fitzpatrick in stretch and is set to play out the final year of his rookie contract this fall  their first step in   wa to pair him with bruce arians  a noted developer of passing talent whose bond with the troubled quarterback go back to when he wa   year old <BRK>adding bridgewater would give the team a solid backup for a quarterback who ha only made   start the past two season due to a combination of injury  league suspension  and subpar play  it could also give tampa bay a viable starter moving forward if the bucs decide to cut bait with winston  if anyone is able to push bridgewater back to his   height  it could be the offensive mind who beat him in a week   showdown that year <BRK>a much a a manning tom coughlin reunion in jacksonville fit  it doesn t make a ton of sense right now  manning is coming off an overlooked revival in    the presence of an actual running game led by saquon barkley helped push him to his most efficient seaon in year  leading to career best in completion and interception rate    percent and     percent  respectively  <BRK>while cutting manning loose would free up    million in cap space in new york  there s no one on the roster who can capably fill in for him  while the team is almost certainly going to select a quarterback this spring  there s no plug and play panacea at the top of this year s draft  releasing him and signing a cheaper veteran option to pair with a rising rookie would give the team   percent of his production at   percent of the price  but swapping the franchise s leading passer for one year of case keenum or blake bortles would be terrible optic in what will likely be another rebuilding year <BRK>just let manning play the helpful mentor role he s earned and retire with the only team for whom he s ever played <BRK>keenum s   saw him revert back to his prior form thanks  in part  to vance joseph s inability to guide an offense  now he ll have to prove he s a capable starter all over again after likely being pushed out of denver by flacco <BRK>the dolphin would welcome him to serve a a veteran mentor to whichever young paser   potentially drew lock or kyler murray   first year head coach brian flores add in this year s draft  that ll be a familiar role for keenum  who served a a placeholder for jared goff in his rookie seaon with the ram in    it ll also give him a chance to rehabilitate his career  albeit on another team run by a defensively minded coach <BRK>at his least impressive he s a useable backup  and at his best   like he wa in minnesota in     he s a top   passer  miami s lack of talent in what promise to be a rebuilding year could push him toward the former  but keenum s capable of surprising the league <BRK>alex smith s football future is uncertain thanks to the broken leg that ended his    and the only other quarterback on the team s roster right now is colt mccoy  while it make sense for washington to invest in a young passer in the draft  the club could also use a stopgap solution who provides an upgrade behind center <BRK>tannehill is still with the dolphin a of now  but it s unlikely he stick around  while he s an injury risk unto himself after missing   game the pat three seaons  he could be a useful centerpiece for an underwhelming offense in the nation s capital  the veteran will have the opportunity to prove he can be more than just a guy who take too many sack and struggle to complete pases downfield in a new environment  <BRK>the only problem for washington is  well  tannehill take too many sack and struggle to complete pass downfield <BRK>mccown will be   year old in    but he might want one more shot to prevent an awful   to be his last memory in the league  the veteran backup wasn t able to capitalize on a better than expected    recording a     passer rating and a     touchdown to interception ratio in three start   though a limited supporting cast didn t help thing <BRK>the arrival of first year head coach adam gase could sweep mccown out  but re signing the well liked veteran could keep some good vibe and appreciated stability in a locker room that hasn t always been known for it functionality  factor in his ability to help mold sam darnold into a sturdy franchise quarterback  and it s tough to see mccown going anywhere else if he chooses not to retire <BRK>taylor return to the place he began his nfl career  baltimore is in need of a reliable backup for lamar jackson  who ran the ball   time per start in the regular seaon and take more damage than the average quarterback  the raven can retain robert griffin iii  who wa perfectly fine a the team s third stringer turned backup late in the seaon  but taylor provides a higher level of play and more stable option for the club that drafted him in   <BRK>the fitzmagic return to ohio a the   year old go back to the second franchise he d ever called home  the bengal floundered with jeff driskel starting in andy dalton s stead  so adding a valued backup behind him make sense  zac taylor s move to push cincinnati into a new era could begin with the addition of an old standby would give the team an insurance policy it lacked in   <BRK>jon gruden is doing his best to make the raider weird while he rebuilds them in his image  derek carr s declining return have left him far removed from the mvp candidate who blossomed in    and the team s eagerness to trade star like khalil mack and amari cooper last season suggests he could be on the chopping block <BRK>that would leave the raider in position to add a franchise quarterback with one of their three first round pick this year  the true supervillain move would be to celebrate stealing oakland s nfl team by adding former athletics first round pick kyler murray to the roster  but no matter what direction gruden chooses  he ll need a veteran quarterback on which to rely  and aj mccarron doesn t count <BRK>enter the guy gruden once compared to ben roethlisberger <BRK>team like the buccaneer and bengal could each use a high value backup like bortles  but in true jaguar upside down  the good place inspiring fashion  let s get weird  the bortles revival begin with the san antonio raider  or wherever they end up  <BRK>
