lat week against the king  stephen curry wa called for traveling on a step back three pointer  a he argued with a referee  he made the number     and     with his finger and held them to his chest   james harden s no      <BRK> two day after curry insinuated that he would have gotten away with a travel if he wa harden  harden beat the nugget by playing in an eerily similar way to how curry used to demolish his opponent  <BRK> the nugget  recognizing the threat that harden presented from deep  were engaging him a soon a he crossed halfcourt  often doubling and trying to trap him  sometimes his defender wa on him a soon a the ball wa inbounded   <BRK> the tactic might have worked if harden wan t a great paser  instead of harden being limited and flustered by the aggressiveness of the nugget defense  he picked them apart by pasing to open teammate a soon a the double team came  he turned the game into a series of   on  s  <BRK> at the same time  he goaded his aggressive single defender into foul  running high screen to free himself  and crossing over jamal murray so badly that the defender s elbow hit the floor   <BRK> harden dropped him pic twitter com  w jzshs n <BRK> harden finished with   point and   assist  but the degree to which he demoralized a rival wa far greater than his statistical impact  it looked like one of those game during curry s magical   season  the kind of curry game we don t see much anymore  <BRK>

   <BRK> a curry mimicked harden s signature step back  i wondered if he missed his day a a solo force of nature in the same way that harden is now   <BRK> while the warrior and curry are still dangerous this seaon   and the amount of shot curry is taking are still in line with some of his best seaon   curry ha been used le a the playmaker of the team  and instead ha been aked to do more of his work off the ball  curry is second in the nba in catch and shoot field goal attempt this seaon  behind klay thompson  wherea in his unanimous mvp seaon he wa  th in the league   <BRK> curry s new role isn t an awful idea   in fact  it s pretty reasonable in the warrior  quest to win  for everybody on the warrior to be happy  someone had to be willing to sacrifice  that someone wa stephen curry   <BRK> but it doe mean that we don t get to see his full power at the prime of his career  curry rarely get to have the type of game that harden did  simply because he isn t allowed to operate a the fulcrum of the team in the way that he used to be  game like saturday s   point explosion in dalla are now the exception  not the norm  <BRK> defending this change for curry  steve kerr said   <BRK> steve kerr on playing steph curry off the ball more when he s with the second unit   with this year s team  we feel pretty strongly that we have to stagger  curry and durant       steph is perfectly comfortable playing off the ball  shaun can post up  i like the look of it   <BRK> kerr also commended curry on handling his new role well  saying   he s done a great job of handling it  it may not be ideal for him  but he understands this is the best thing for u right now  we have to put the best group together   <BRK> curry s unselfishness is great for winning title  the warrior still have one of the best offense in the league  and regardless of their struggle this season  they re primed for another final run  if not victory   <BRK> the problem with curry s new role is purely selfish   it s not a much fun for u  nor seemingly for him  <BRK>

   <BRK> it s a reminder that curry and the warrior can t be the curry and warrior of old  the makeup of the team is different  in part because kevin durant  who the team need to appease in order to retain him in free agency  like to have the ball in his hand to create his own shot  their guiding principle is no longer to play revolutionary basketball with curry at the center   pushing the pace  and forcing defense into hysteric   but to have better player than everyone else   <BRK> when the warrior first got durant  there wa a question of which of the original player would have to sacrifice to accommodate the new superstar  klay thompson quickly said that it wouldn t be him  and his game ha largely stayed the same  though he s in a shooting slump this season  draymond green han t been himself on both end of the floor  but he maintains a similar role to the one he s always had  because of curry s obscene talent and an attitude that put team success over everything  he is the one who the burden of adapting always fall on  especially this year   <BRK> maybe curry will take center stage again once demarcus cousin start playing and curry doesn t need to prop up the bench unit  but based on kerr s comment  he s comfortable with keeping curry off the ball going forward   <BRK> curry s versatility then  ha made him the most valuable player on the team  and at the same time cost him the opportunity to be at his most powerful   <BRK> i   and many warrior fan   miss that  there are few thing better in baketball than seeing the warrior destroy opposing team with curry running the show  he void defensive plan  just a harden did against the nugget  opponent  insistence on preventing curry s deep three either lead to high pick and roll that give him a lot of space to operate  or double team that allow him to use his vision to find teammate for open shot   <BRK>

   <BRK> or  it lead to his best highlight  like him making chris paul touch the ground  that s when he see the trap  doesn t pas the ball away  and decides to dribble through multiple defender before releasing a quick shot that demoralizes those trying to stop him   <BRK> when curry wa able to play like that  the warrior team looked more like the next stage of baketball  rather simply an incredibly talented team  curry looked like he d cracked the code to the game  like he wa operating at a higher level than everyone else  he made the hardest shot in the game look a eay a a layup  and all attempt to contain him feel ridiculous   <BRK> that still happens occaionally  but it s by design now that those game don t happen a often  against the maverick on sunday  curry had one of those signature game  out dueling luka doncic to finish with   point and   three  the performance only happened because durant aked kerr to call play for curry instead of for himself  a kerr explained after the game  <BRK>  kd  knew steph had it going  and there were a couple play i called for kevin  and he said   no  let s flip it  let s go the opposite way       a couple time in timeouts  i drew up a play and he just said   why don t steph and i flip   those guy  they have a feel for what s happening on the floor  so i m always willing to change up and make sure they re comfortable out there with what we re doing  <BRK>

   <BRK> and yet  curry didn t need to have the ball to have a big game  that playing mostly off the ball this season ha one little to ruin curry s effectiveness is a true testament to how great he really is  <BRK> that s it   to finish it up  curry is shooting     at the rim           in floater range           from     ft             on long   s          on corner   s           on other   s       at age    there s no real weakness for him a a scorer <BRK> still  curry s selfleness make the warrior offense a lot le exciting  not that aesthetic should be of primary concern to a championship caliber team  but the idea of the warrior  what made them so fun a few year ago  wa dependent on curry being the playmaker that he isn t anymore   <BRK> a sacrificial curry is still great and probably best for the warrior this seaon  but it also mean that we are missing out on the best version of him  a sensible a the change is  it s also bittersweet  i miss the old steph  <BRK> for more on steph curry s role this season <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
