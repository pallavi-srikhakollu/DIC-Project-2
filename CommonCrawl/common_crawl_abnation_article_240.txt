los angeles ram quarterback jared goff turned   in october  and   at the time   wa in the hunt for the nfl mvp award  through the first three month of the season  he had   touchdown  six interception  and a     passer rating <BRK>then seven touchdown and seven interception in his last seven game took some gloss off a stellar third season in the nfl  but now goff ha the chance to cap that season with a win in super bowl   <BRK>just one problem  to get the job done  he ll have to out duel the best postseason quarterback ever <BRK>tom brady will play in his ninth super bowl   three more than any other player in nfl history   and will try to win the new england patriot a lombardi trophy for a sixth time <BRK>that s a daunting task for the ram  who have only four player   aqib talib  c j  anderson  brandin cook  and sam shield   with any super bowl experience  while brady ha played in   career playoff game  goff ha played in three <BRK>ha goff shown in his limited time in the postseason that he ha what it take to get the job done against the patriot  well  not always <BRK>the ram  offense finished the   regular season with a league leading     point per game  but couldn t get going against the falcon  at the heart of the offensive issue for los angeles wa todd gurley s struggle on the ground <BRK>the all pro running back finished the game with   rushing yard  but   of those yard came on four rush in the fourth quarter  prior to that he had only   yard on   carry through the first three quarter of the game <BRK>goff struggled to keep the chain moving early   the ram had   offensive play and three punt on their first three drive   and just like that it wa a     lead for the falcon early in the second quarter <BRK>all that said  he did have a couple fantastic throw that gave the ram a shot  he dropped a perfect touchdown pas into cooper kupp in the second quarter <BRK>and he set up another chance to score before halftime with a laser downfield to robert wood that resulted in a   yard gain <BRK>the ram settled for a field goal on the latter drive after a holding penalty pushed them back  but goff s two throw had the team down only     at halftime <BRK>then the falcon blew the game open in the second half and pushed the game out of reach for the sluggish los angeles offense <BRK>ultimately  it wa his inefficiency that kept the ram from keeping up with the falcon  he completed just     percent of his pass  and even that wa an inflated number after he strung together   straight completion during one drive in the final minute of the fourth quarter  only   of his completion came in the first three quarter <BRK> i think it took a little longer than usual to settle in   goff told the los angeles time after the game <BRK>by the time the ram quarterback looked like himself with any consistency  it wa already too late <BRK>his return to the playoff wa pretty similar statistically to his debut a year earlier  goff completed     percent of his pass and  again  didn t do much to help the team while also not doing much to hurt it <BRK>the difference this time wa the ram  rushing attack got going in a big way  gurley had   yard on   attempt  and c j  anderson had   yard on   attempt  the ram committed to a smashmouth style of football against dallas  and the offensive line dominated the line of scrimmage <BRK>goff s lack of contribution to the ram  scoring total may make it look like he had a bad game  but he really just wan t aked to do much  he threw the ball only twice in the fourth quarter and didn t have his soul taken by the cowboy defense  aqib talib reminded the world a much with some colorful language after the game <BRK>but the ram really could ve blown out dallas in a bigger way if goff wa able to punctuate long  ball control drive with touchdown in the red zone  the team s first drive of the game could ve ended with a touchdown  but goff wa rushed into an incomplete pas on third down with multiple open receiver <BRK>the ram settled for a   yard field goal instead  and when a pair of throw to brandin cook in the end zone weren t completed on the next drive  the ram had to kick a   yard field goal <BRK>eventually the ram got in the end zone   goff s inability to complement the successful rushing attack with drive ending touchdown almost proved costly  though <BRK>finally  we saw a version of goff that resembled his regular season self when the ram played the saint in the nfc championship  it wasn t exactly a prolific day for the third year quarterback  but he completed     percent of his pass and nearly reached   passing yard  both were close to his   regular season average of     percent and   yard <BRK>those number are more impressive considering the ram  offense had serious difficulty with the noise in the superdome in new orleans  several time  goff wa shown on the fox broadcast struggling to hear ram coach sean mcvay through his headset <BRK>goff wa especially good in the second half and overtime  where he completed   of his   pass for   yard  his only interception of the game clanged off the hand of gurley <BRK>after that  he wa pretty damn good <BRK>the saint only had one play that gained more than   yard against the ram  defense  and it probably should ve been intercepted  but ram receiver brandin cook  gerald everett  and josh reynolds each hauled in a deep pas for a gain of more than   yard <BRK>the first wa a beautiful perfect pas down the left sideline to cook that set up a desperately needed touchdown before halftime <BRK>jared goff with a beauty of a pas to brandin cook for   yard  larams pic twitter com qvhasxxwfd<BRK>the next two came on another back against the wall drive for the ram that ended with a game tying field goal  on the first  goff bought time by scrambling to his right before firing a dart to everett <BRK>goff find gerald everett on  rd and   for a   yard gain  larams pic twitter com blfwabo <BRK>two play later  he hit reynolds for   yard down the left sideline <BRK>goff getting going in the fourth   pic twitter com i epmqi vd<BRK>the ram didn t have the best day running the ball against the saint  when they needed goff to step up in the biggest moment  he did  that bodes well for his chance at showing up big against the patriot in super bowl   <BRK>
