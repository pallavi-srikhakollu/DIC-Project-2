six year  six long year of frustration  disappointment and heartbreak  six year  the second longest postseason drought in denver nugget franchise history   <BRK> done   <BRK> there will be no decade of mismanaged roster  multiple ugly moment and futility at all level of the organization this time  no  this time the denver nugget are back  with their victory over the boston celtic last night  denver cemented what had become a foregone conclusion month ago  the nugget are going back to the playoff  <BRK> for many fan  this will be their first playoff experience  six year in the city of denver is a lifetime in this era of growth and expansion   <BRK> it s an eternity for a fan base in a city that ha been busy enjoying historical season and championship at the hand of arguably the greatest quarterback to ever live  the denver bronco  run of glory is over for now  though  and it s the nugget turn to carry the torch  the experience will be new for a large percentage of this rapidly growing fanbase  and regardless of the final outcome  it will be memorable  <BRK> all postseaon competition is wonderful but there s something special about the nba playoff  like postseaon baeball  fan live and die with every shot  pa  and dribble  just a baeball fan hang on every pitch  like playoff hockey  the pace is fat  unlike playoff hockey  the scoring is much more frequent  the high and low ebb and flow so much quicker  each game bringing a mix of hope and despair   <BRK>  through it all  every player is shot with close up angle  unobstructed by any sort of helmet  it provides a very personal feel for the fan  enhancing the entire experience of a basketball game  i can t wait for all of the new fan to this team   the one who have shown out night in and night out for this team at pepsi center   to get to experience that feeling  <BRK> i can t wait for them to experience the rivalry that will come from it   there s a reason name like kobe bryant or manu ginobli  john stockton or karl malone strike anger in the heart of nugget fan  we remember the playoff  rusell westbrook didn t become a nugget villain becaue he shoved nikola jokic or becaue he blocked rocky s half court shot  he became a villain becaue he proceeded to dunk all over u in the first round of the   playoff while screaming about every successful screen he set  the odds are pretty good that half of the western conference field will come from the northwest division  how memorable will it be to pay westbrook back  or wish juuf nurkic a nice summer  <BRK> nothing is guaranteed though  a nugget fan from the carmelo anthony era know all too well  it s one thing to talk about being swept by kobe and the los angeles lakers  or even losing to them in the western conference final  though the nugget opened up two different series with a road victory against the san antonio spur  it wan t really all that surprising that they got dealt with in gentleman s sweep fahion   <BRK> it wa however shocking to lose to the los angeles clipper  the utah jazz or even the junior version of this golden state warrior dynasty  fan came into those series with the same type of confidence with which nugget nation will enter the postseason this year and they left bitterly disappointed  it wan t like losing to the lakers in seven game  each of those aforementioned series denver never really had much of a chance  they fell behind     each time  no doubt melo era fan enter this postseason run with a touch of cautious optimism  <BRK> still  there s reason to believe this time there s something more  the roster tim connelly and company have constructed is far more complete than any group put together by mark warkentein and friend  and it s a greater collection of talent than masai ujiri ever acquired in denver   <BRK> curb the cautious optimism all you want but this nugget team is really good  and it show  it show in a healthy starting unit that routinely out performs it opposition  it show in a bench that ha depth to carry both side of the ball while the starter catch their wind  sure  outside of paul millsap there is no player in the rotation who ha notable playoff experience  and the nugget have seemingly moved past the point of expecting to get significant contribution from isaiah thomas  at least on the court  playoff inexperience is an obstacle they will have to overcome  but this team ha shown the resiliency to overcome a myriad of obstacle that have been thrown at them this season  whether that s been injury  road trip  or tony brother  <BRK> the nugget can not ride on that playoff inexperience excuse  not now  the day of just being satisfied with getting into the postseason  or even just winning the division are over  for the fan that have been here since the day of alex english  or david thompson  or even byron beck  they know that opportunity like this are rare  melo got a two seed once in his career  it wa the only time he advanced past the first round  english and thompson did it twice and each player s only trip to the conference final with the team came on the back of one of those   seed  finishing this out strong is important for setting up up something truly special  something that the franchise and the fan have only seen once every decade or so  <BRK> there s also the potential prize of franchise history  the nugget tied the warrior atop the western conference with their win over the celtic and the warrior loss to the spur  with thirteen game to go denver control their own destiny to secure the top overall seed  the last time the nugget were the top overall seed in the playoff they played with a red  white and blue basketball  they ve never done it in the nba but it is right in front of them now  no matter what happens in the playoff if this team can pas the warrior in the standing for good they will go down in nugget history  that is something that every fan is hoping for  new or old  <BRK> so soak it in nugget nation  we are headed back to the postseason  we are going to wring our hand every time the nugget fall down by six point  we re going to shout with excitement with every drained three and we re going to find out what this exciting young core look like at the next level  we are going to live and die with every bounce of the ball and for better or worse we are going to remember what happens in late april hopefully all the way through to june  the second season is starting soon   and the denver nugget are back  <BRK>  <BRK>
