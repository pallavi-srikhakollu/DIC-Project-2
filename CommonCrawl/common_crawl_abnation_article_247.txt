  <BRK>the easiest answer is that for much of the season  san antonio looked like it might miss the playoff entirely  only in the last few week have the spur put together a consistent stretch where they look like potential world beater  the rodeo trip wa a disaster  and though it s been wahed away by this impressive streak with a couple of signature win  it s not forgotten  elite  championship level san antonio team usually ace the rodeo trip  this version tripped all over themselves away from the alamo <BRK>the rodeo trip is actually a tremendous example of san antonio s biggest problem  the spur  defense on the road is indefensible  per nba com stats  san antonio s defense at home rank a respectable no    in the league  the spur  road defense is an abysmal no     this split is totally uncharacteristic and surely maddening for those involved  when gregg popovich ha ranted about his team this season  it s usually been about defensive effort and execution while on the road  <BRK>no such home road gap exists for the spur  offense  no    at home  no    on the road  and no defensive home road gap existed last season when san antonio had the no    defense overall  no    at home  no    on road   when you break it down further  shooting defense appears to be the culprit  san antonio rank no    in opponent effective field goal percentage at home and no    on the road  the spur allow much higher conversion rate from both behind the arc and in the lane on the road than at home  but the gap is more striking on three pointer <BRK>most team are better at home than on the road  which why i m using league ranking to put it in context  still  the spur  split are extreme  <BRK>here s another way to look at it  <BRK>the average nba team ha a scoring margin of roughly      point per game at home and a scoring margin of roughly      point per game on the road  if a perfectly average team wa lucky enough to play every game at home  you d expect them to go      if a perfectly average team had to play every game on the road  you d expect them to go      <BRK>the spur  meanwhile  are      per game at home this season and      per game on the road  under this theory  if san antonio played every game at home  they d go      if the spur played every game on the road  they d go      no other good team in the nba ha a split this extreme  it s like san antonio is two different team  depending on where they are playing <BRK>this is the easy answer to the question of why the spur aren t considered a true challenger to the warrior  because when you get them on the road  they look like they don t even belong in the vicinity of the conversation  <BRK>the harder answer to defend is the spur don t meet our expectation of what a golden state challenger should look like  san antonio ha gone retro  focusing on a highly effective isolation and mid range focused offensive attack  the spur traded their best player in kawhi leonard  who also happened to be one of the few player in the nba who people thought could give multiple warrior trouble in a playoff series  <BRK>a a result  san antonio boats two of the best old school offensive player of their generation in demar derozan and lamarcus aldridge  that and some shooting is baically san antonio s entire  top    offense  it doesn t look like anything else in the league  and it s not in any way progressive  unlike the unique but seemingly forward thinking houston attack   <BRK>in the collective imagination  the spur  offense is retrograde in the worst sense of the word  so it doesn t get recognition or respect despite being deadly effective  did people forget that aldridge once starred in one of the greatest offense of all time next to brandon roy  do people still respect shot creation so little a a skill that they can t recognize derozan s excellent combination of usage rate and efficiency despite his lack of three point shooting <BRK>the spur are a   s style team with   s style star  we don t want to believe that could be the answer to stopping the warrior  not while there s hope in the ultra modern vanguard presented by team like milwaukee and houston  <BRK>of course  the spur aren t the answer to stopping the warrior because there is no stopping the warrior until and unless the warrior stop themselves  this is all an academic exercise we do to keep ourselves entertained until the playoff begin  <BRK>that  perhaps  make the dismissal of the spur all the more unbecoming  they can t even win respect in a purely theoretical debate  it honestly say more about the state of the debate than it doe the spur  <BRK>nba news and link delivered to your inbox each weekday  so you never miss out <BRK>
