d angelo russell scored a career high   point in brooklyn s massive   point comeback victory over sacramento tuesday night  he orchestrated both the net  largest come from behind win and highest scoring fourth quarter in franchise history  those are two huge accomplishment on their own <BRK>but notably for russell    of his   point came off layup and shot attempt within six foot of the rim  if there s any takeaway from his career night  it s that he can break down a defense and get his shot in the paint  rather than just being a jump shooter <BRK>that s an accomplishment because russell han t done much of it this season  brooklyn s all star ha only   field goal within five or fewer foot on the year  that rank him lower than guard who play significantly fewer minute and lesser role  like new york s allonzo trier  washington s john wall   who han t played since the day after christmas     year old dwyane wade  and cleveland s jordan clarkson  <BRK>in total  there are   guard with more field goal made within five or fewer foot than russell  two of those guard are his teammate  spencer dinwiddie and joe harris <BRK>sacramento s defense helped russell do this  they allow about   point in the paint per game  the second most in the league behind only phoenix  that mean you  the reader  could probably lace up and get a layup on the king tomorrow night <BRK>but point in the paint  for guard  mean something else  it mean that guard wa able to break the defense down  <BRK>russell ha never been known to be a downhill attacking guard  he s compensated for that by hitting  s at an alarmingly high rate  against sacramento  he notched his  nd triple of the year  the most ever in a net single season  earlier this season  he became the youngest player to reach   three made  a record that stood until devin booker caught him in early march <BRK>brooklyn complement russell s skill set with better penetrator  dinwiddie is a relentless rim attacker with the speed to get by his man on a whim  caris levert broke defense down at will before his nasty leg injury earlier in the season  somehow  harris ha developed into the one of the best finisher at the rim in the nba  due to the threat of his jumper <BRK>russell never showed that kind of ability to get to the rack at will  partially  that s because he didn t need to get there  but he s not the quickest guard in the nba  russell s foot speed is certainly not comparable to de aaron fox  dennis schroder  or russell westbrook  it s just not in his dna  and it s inhibited him from getting around some of the league s stickier defender  <BRK>but that wasn t the case in brooklyn s comeback against sacramento  russell is known to have ice in his vein when the game s on the line  and he tends to freeze the defense by knocking down three they still don t expect him to shoot  now  he s showing he can freeze defender and get to the rim  too <BRK>if this is a part of russell s game the league hasn t seen  it s another layer to a young player who s becoming more dangerous by the week <BRK>
