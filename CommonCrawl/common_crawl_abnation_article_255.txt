welcome to the special season finale edition of the fmi  today we celebrate the lack of celebration  applaud the pained silence  and sing hail to the victim  extra valid at the peach bowl   <BRK> if you are unfamiliar with the fmi  you can find the rule here and here  also  do yourself a favor and read through the whole season  cuz it s been a treat  <BRK> maybe i m naive but i honestly wan t expecting much movement out of bowl seaon  i have never been more happy to be wrong  a the bowl seaon produced a healthy dose of reality to score of fan who thought maybe thing just might end on a high note  we even had a pair of dream crushing double drop to finish out the seaon   <BRK> there is a lot to talk about this week  so let s take a look at the big board  <BRK>  <BRK>  cheezitbowl pic twitter com oiz gzrs <BRK>  <BRK> we aren t finished yet  though  what competition would be complete without some end of the year award   <BRK> this award is meant exactly a it sound  which fan bae wa most deserving of the tier which they occupy  good or bad  this year i am pleaed to present the award to the fan of the army black knight  who have ridden a seaon of unprecedented success all the way to a   point clobbering of houston and the first   win seaon in school history  this award will not always be a good thing  but i m glad it is this year  here s the bad news  your coaching staff is about to be a hot commodity  what s left of it  anyway  <BRK> the award for the team with the most movement wa a tight competition this year  with several team experiencing   level change over the course of the seaon  in the end this wa awarded on style point  and no team had quite a much tristesse de vivre a the bulldog  never one to stay in the same place for too long  state even finished the seaon in style with a lat minute level drop just to make sure they didn t finish the seaon in the first circle  <BRK> given to the team with the broadest range of level experienced in a single season  the winner of rollercoaster season wa unanimous  the buffalo started the season with a five game winning streak  including a rivalry win and a beat down of a conference opponent  it s easy to forget that they spent four straight week in the first circle before launching into what would become a seven game losing skid to end the season  landing them finally in the eighth circle  you are the fmi s own beautiful child  buff  and my only regret is that you didn t have the gumption to finish the job and find the ninth circle  there s always next year  <BRK> and finally  the moment we have all been waiting for    <BRK> this will be a controversial call   particularly coming from an a m blog   but it is the only correct answer  the noles were not the first team to find their way to the ninth circle  that honor belongs to the new mexico state aggies who did so with a speed and purpose that were terrible to behold  quite literally   they weren t even the first p  team to hit rock bottom  an honor reserved for the living shakespearean tragicomedy that wa the rutgers scarlet knight  florida state even beat fellow ninth circler louisville straight up  <BRK> however  a look at the ninth circle reveals one truth  no one expects more from their team in that group than fsu  new mexico state is a conferenceless nomad  early season fodder for a team with grander vision  rutgers is a p  team in the same sense that aquaman is part of the justice league   he s useless but hey it s a package deal  florida state  on the other hand  is a historical success  they are a team with skin on the wall and legendary hall of fame coach in their past  expectation inevitably lead to disappointment  <BRK> florida state wa a team far too talented to just go     like rutgers  no  the noles almost managed to be bowl eligible at the same time that they entered the ninth circle of hell  that take creativity  gumption  and a lot of   point loss   this team wa just good enough to really accentuate how badly thing went wrong for them  <BRK>   florida state wa a team of destiny and we may not see it like again for some time  it is with that in mind that the fmi officially name it highest honor  the award for the most miserable fan base  the taggart trophy  congratulation noles  may this post be lemon juice in the open gator wound on your chest  <BRK>
