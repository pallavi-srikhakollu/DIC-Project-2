on martin luther king jr  day  every political  corporate  and sport team twitter account seems duty bound to send at least one message quoting or thanking the civil right icon  college football is very much part of this national mandate  <BRK>most mlk day tweet by sport team and coach are performative but harmless  then there is this  sent out by florida state s recruiting department on monday  <BRK>that graphic  which wa deleted after le than an hour of going up  came from fsu s official recruiting twitter account shortly before   p m  et  <BRK>the program apologized about two hour later  <BRK>pic twitter com wea haoqs<BRK>in a well intentioned effort to recognize martin luther king jr  on this special day  a member of our recruiting staff created a graphic using one of dr  king s quote    if i cannot do great thing  i can do small thing in a great way   the quote resonated with our program s do something mantra  however  in our attempt to more closely connect the message to fsu  we foolishly posted a graphic that wa not in line with our intent  we are sorry for missing the mark in our attempt to celebrate dr  king s legacy <BRK> dosomething is fsu s hashtag under coach willie taggart  it got the noles widely mocked during taggart s first season  when fsu went     and missed a bowl for the first time in   year  martin luther king jr   to be fair  wa absolutely a guy who  didsomething  <BRK>this is a problem  though  for a few reason  <BRK>the original picture come from the march on washington in    where king gave his famous  i have a dream  speech in front of the national mall <BRK>while king s arm is up in the original photo  it s pretty clear someone not only added the glove onto his hand  but also photoshopped the hand to point forward so he s doing the tomahawk chop  <BRK>you can see and hear the chop dozen of time throughout an fsu game   or a brave baeball game  or chief football game  it s best described a  a rhythmic extension and contraction of the forearm  with the palm open  to mimic the action of chopping   fsu fan chop while chanting along with the war chant  performed by the marching chief band <BRK>fsu ha worked in concert with the seminole tribe of florida to clear it reference to indigenous culture  but i will just leave a portion of a dr  king quote about america s treatment of indigenous people right here  <BRK> our nation wa born in genocide when it embraced the doctrine that the original american  the indian  wa an inferior race  even before there were large number of negro on our shore  the scar of racial hatred had already disfigured colonial society  from the sixteenth century forward  blood flowed in battle of racial supremacy  we are perhaps the only nation which tried a a matter of national policy to wipe out it indigenous population  moreover  we elevated that tragic experience into a noble crusade  indeed  even today we have not permitted ourselves to reject or to feel remorse for this shameful episode  our literature  our film  our drama  our folklore all exalt it  <BRK>it s safe to assume that king wouldn t have been a fan of co opting indigenous culture to support a sport team  <BRK>fsu s account is not the only one to put king s likeness next to a nike brand mark  carolina put the jordan brand logo on it mlk graphic <BRK>and alabama had king looking right over a swoosh  <BRK>some account have nike logo on every graphic  <BRK>but nike ha run afoul of child labor standard in the past and still draw criticism for how it treat worker  king s anti capitalist statement suggest he d be against being linked to the company <BRK>i imagine you already know that i am much more socialistic in my economic theory than capitalistic  and yet i am not so opposed to capitalism that i have failed to see it relative merit  it started out with a noble and high motive  viz  to block the trade monopoly of noble  but like most human system it fail victim to the very thing it wa revolting against  so today capitalism ha outlived it usefulness <BRK>and other people in different part of fsu s athletic department showed how to do it with the same picture alabama used  <BRK>honoring the life and legacy of dr  martin luther king jr   whose dream of peace  equality and freedom made our nation stronger   mlkday pic twitter com ww f gzeid<BRK>the head coach tweeted this  <BRK>if you can t fly  then run if you cant run  then walk  if you cant walk  then crawl  but whatever you do  you have to keep moving forward martin luther king  jr  martinlutherkingjrday    pic twitter com  ydixjdo <BRK>it is doubly disappointing that a program that ha willie taggart   the first black head football coach in fsu history   a it most public employee would fumble this  <BRK>in late november  following his disappointing first season  someone photoshopped taggart s face onto a picture of multiple people being lynched and posted it to facebook  the person who made the graphic got fired from his job  and a state attorney opened an investigation into the incident  fsu s president swiftly came to taggart s defense  <BRK>this recent history take the act of cheapening king s legacy with branded meme to another level of disappointment  <BRK>the ideal that king stood for didn t end with his death  and the hatred he fought still burn  to be tone deaf enough to send this graphic out like fsu did  amid the context of what the program is already dealing with  is certainly  doing     something  <BRK>but it s not a good thing  <BRK>
