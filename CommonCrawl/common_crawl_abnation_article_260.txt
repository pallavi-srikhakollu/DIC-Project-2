this is not a ranking of college football division by how good they are  this is a ranking of college football division by how interesting they are  the two naturally track together a lot of the time  but sometimes  they don t  so here are the   fbs division  including the big    with no division   stacked up by my personal intrigue level heading into    <BRK>arkansas state is always a threat to be fun on offense  and texas state should go from horrible to at least watchable under new coach jake spavital  but the three best team in the conference these day are all in the east  and there s nothing all that exciting here  <BRK>trevor lawrence s heisman campaign will be fun  <BRK>buffalo s ultra fun  ultra large qb tyree jackson going to the nfl make the most fun team in the east le captivating entering the year  there s not much to holler about in the west  either  but it s worth following how niu doe without rod carey  now at temple  and how ex florida coach jim mcelwain doe with what s been a horrible central michigan team <BRK>the west had three of the worst five team in the country in    according to s p   in utsa  utep  and rice  the east ha a few team that were bad in   but have  in theory  bigger upside  charlotte  now under ex austin peay coach will healy   fau  under lane kiffin   old dominion  in the talented tidewater region of virginia   and wku  which wa great under jeff brohm  then terrible for two year under mike sanford   it wouldn t be a shock if one or two of those four made a big leap forward in    <BRK>fresno state wa   and should remain   the best team in the division  elsewhere  at least hawaii s offense can be a lot of fun to watch  <BRK>appalachian state and troy have both been awesome  will they keep being awesome under new coach  and will georgia southern keep moving forward  <BRK>dana holgorsen s at houston now  and that s interesting a hell  memphis is a big wild card without running back darrell henderson  off to the nfl  and offensive coordinator kenny dillingham  to auburn   but the tiger are aggressively fun every year now  tulane s doing better than it ha in year  and navy and smu should both be better than they were in     <BRK>two big question in los angeles year     doe clay helton get fired   probably      doe chip kelly s ucla make enough of a jump to be good and not just ok   it could happen   plus  khalil tate s playing his senior year at arizona  and colorado s mel tucker hire wa notable because the buff went against the current grain and hired a defensive guy  i ve always thought colorado s a kind of attractive job  maybe tucker can run with it   <BRK>ucf  even on a one game losing streak  is the gold standard of the group of   until someone in the group of   beat it  plus  doe cincinnati have staying power a a new year s six bowl contender  is charlie strong s usf going to stop careening toward a cliff  will temple stay strong under it  approximately   th coach in the lat five year  will ecu recover from a bad scottie montgomery tenure and get good again under james madison s national championship coach  mike houston  will uconn play well enough to make staying in fbs seem like a defensible idea  <BRK>will virginia tech bounce back from a highly un virginia tech    will miami convert a golden start to the offseason into actual win  will mack brown do ok at unc  do virginia and pitt keep taking step forward after making encouraging stride in a bad division  <BRK>following the coastal will be like taking your kid to a farm with the full knowledge that all the nice cow are about to be slaughtered and made into hamburger for clemson  but college football is not all about title  <BRK>utah state wa  th in s p   boise state wa  th  that s the most interesting two team race atop a division anywhere in the non power conference  the bronco  opener in jacksonville against florida state is one of week   s most eye catching matchup  but the division probably come down to boise s visit to logan  <BRK>nebraska finished the year on a     run and ha a great sophomore qb for scott frost s second year  to go along with a schedule that line up favorably in odd numbered year   the big ten west s likeliest contender all visit lincoln   until further notice  wisconsin s bad   should be considered an aberration  brohm stayed at purdue  and northwestern could always fall over as backwards into   win and a division title again  <BRK>it s probably georgia s division  but for a change  the dawgs don t feel inevitable  thanks to a mix of transfer and getting soundly beaten by both lsu and texas  florida had a strong first year under dan mullen  and this could make for a dramatic divisional race  and can kentucky find some consistency after it best year since   <BRK>washington  washington state  stanford  and oregon could all win this division without creating any big surprise  they could also all lose four game or more  in my household  we respect chaos  even when it just lead to a conference missing the playoff again  <BRK>is this the year jim harbaugh finally beat ohio state  <BRK>i m kidding  obviously  of course it s not  but the buckeye will have a first year head coach in ryan day and  maybe  an eligible five star transfer at qb  penn state should be good  and michigan should play a good first   game  the top of the east is still a wringer     <BRK>alabama just lost a football game by   point  giving the tide an air of vulnerability they almost never have  lsu and texa a m have recruited instant impact   clas  and auburn perpetually lurks a either a title contender or a     team  <BRK>these are the two likeliest outcome  <BRK>the first  jalen hurt lead oklahoma to it fifth conference championship in a row  quite possibly setting up a zesty meeting with his old alabama teammate in the playoff  <BRK>the second  <BRK>either way  it ll be a rip roaring good time  <BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK>
