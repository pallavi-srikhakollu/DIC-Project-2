    with a bright new coach and a promising generation of young player    like christian pulisic  tyler adam  and josh sargent    the usmnt may be on the brink of a renaissance  sb nation take a look at the player and idea refueling american soccer 
  <BRK>by the time the ml playoff rolled around in november  gregg berhalter had already been declared the next united state men s national team head coach by the american soccer rumor mill  fan tuned into the columbus crew s playoff game to get a glimpse of how the usmnt might play in the future  and while we got to see what made berhalter s crew a great ml team  we also saw what he ll be missing in his new job  federico higuaín <BRK>higuaín wa columbus  hero in the knockout stage  scoring two goal against d c  united  he sat the first half against the new york red bull four day later  and when he came off the bench  he created this goal <BRK>just  pure   that pas from milton  tho   crewsc    claimglory    clbvrbny       pic twitter com bgwbnhrale<BRK>what american man can do that with any regularity <BRK>there wa a lot to like about berhalter s crew  they kept the ball very well  often building slowly from the back  but also consistently looked for opportunity to play direct pass that beat defender  they used the entire pitch  with wide player and central midfielders who were all equally capable of creating scoring chance  they had a good defensive shape and a well defined pressing strategy  if berhalter is a good coach  he can instill those principle into the usmnt <BRK>but those principle worked a well a they did because of the talent of higuaín   a sensational playmaking central attacking midfielder  commonly referred to a a no     so how is berhalter supposed to build a better  more attractive usmnt without a player like him  there are no obvious solution to this problem  but plenty of potentially good one <BRK>berhalter     is an adaptable coach  he played a much more conservative style a manager of hammarby in sweden  and had no problem setting up his crew team to play direct when opponent gave them space to do so  but if u s  soccer wanted a coach to grind out result with his player  excellent fitness and athleticism  they would have hired someone else <BRK>it s also clear from it recent hire that u s  soccer would like to move in a different direction  new chief sport development director nico romeijn  formerly of the dutch fa  wa one of the key figure in hiring dutch american general manager earnie stewart  he went on to hire berhalter  who say he got most of his idea about how the game should be played from the netherlands  the usmnt want to play stylishly like the dutch do  with the ball on the ground <BRK> we want to use the ball to disorganize the opponent to create goal scoring opportunity   berhalter told me in october <BRK>the crew succeeded at that by building their attack around higuaín  one problem  there s never been an higuaín in the u s  player pool <BRK>creative forward joe max moore filled the central attacking midfield role well when needed in the  s  a did smooth pasing central midfielder tab ramos around the same time  then claudio reyna into the  s  the following generation fielded some other very good player in that role   second striker clint dempsey and landon donovan  most notably   but none of them wa ever a true playmaking central attacking midfielder  <BRK>most recently  that responsibility ha fallen on a couple of young player   christian pulisic  who only play wide for his club team  and julian green  who ha been an effective defensive no     but not much of a playmaker  there are a few promising attacking midfielders in the youth rank  but none play regular top division soccer at the moment <BRK>to understand the problem that berhalter is solving for  we need to talk about exactly what higuaín meant to his system in columbus <BRK>this is higuaín s first highlight of the season    minute into the season opener  one day  an american man will show this kind of technique and movement with regularity  three sobbing emojis  <BRK>higuaín can also create a ton of space for his teammate with nothing more than his dangerous reputation  team are often so scared of letting him get any time on the ball that they ll chase him anywhere on the pitch  it s not uncommon to see a midfielder close down aggressively on higuaín  opening up huge space for one of his teammate to attack <BRK>if you keep your eye trained on higuaín during a crew match  it s clear that he s a vocal and demonstrative leader  higuaín look like a traffic cop  but one who command the respect of a general  he will clap and give thumb up in response to pas that weren t intended for him  or point where he want a pas to go or a teammate to run  and other player follow his lead on when to press aggressively or fall back into shape  <BRK>berhalter can t manufacture that  there s no tactical solution for not having any player with higuaín s reputation or experience <BRK>what berhalter probably can solve for  though  is higuaín s final third contribution  defender will close down on any junk player who is central and   yard from goal  so if berhalter can get the ball into that area  he can draw defender out of position  goal and assist won t be that hard to replace either   this is where christian pulisic is     time better than anyone who s ever played for the crew <BRK>here s the long version of the goal from the beginning of this story  watch all of the dope stuff that the non higuaín people do <BRK>we are strictly about that switching play  line splitting  and defender attracting action  pic twitter com dttpolw se<BRK>there are some hard pas here  yes  central midfielder artur and left back milton valenzuela are probably a bit better at long pas than any of their american counterpart  but this build up is mostly about good coaching  the crew s player know how they want to move the ball from back to front  and everyone make good individual decision about where to move and who to pas to  the structure and decision making in this move are much more important than anyone s talent  right up until the ball reach higuaín  there are even a couple of sloppy touch that the crew don t get punished for because they re making all the right choice <BRK>berhalter s commitment to playing out of the back ha led defender who were once pretty average with their foot to get really good  this very nice and somewhat terrifying exchange is typical of the crew <BRK>thinking about the usmnt trying to do this stress me out pic twitter com k vsnhoqvn<BRK>the u s  men s national team doe not have silky skilled center back  but neither do the crew  really  watching american defender try to play like this might scare even the most ardent of pep guardiola stans into screaming  hoof it   but your anxiety will soon pas  berhalter is  if nothing else  good at coaching the spacing and decision making necessary for playing the ball out of the back <BRK>once they get the ball forward  the crew are really good at moving the ball inide and out to draw defender out of position and create tap in for their center forward  this is a bit tougher to accomplish without a central attacking midfielder who pick perfect pass out wide  but the usmnt also ha better wide option than the crew  the most common source of usmnt goal during the berhalter era is likely to be pulisic run to the byline  and cutback for a josh sargent  or gyasi zardes  finish from six yard <BRK>doe all that sound exciting  well  how s this for excitement <BRK>this   a line of two black shirted forward ahead of four black shirted midfielders  waiting for the opponent to cross midfield rather than pressuring the ball   is the defining image of the   columbus crew  sure  they had   percent possession   good for second in ml   but the other   percent of the time  they looked like this  if you watched more than one crew match  this image is burned into your brain  the crew were better at building up slowly through the middle than counter attacking quickly  and they didn t have great athlete to press high up the pitch  so they sat in this shape a lot and waited for opponent to cross midfield before aggressing <BRK>boring  right  well  the usmnt ha better athlete and worse deep passing than the crew  so it appears that berhalter s usmnt is going to do something a little different <BRK>something for  usmnt fan to ponder  pic twitter com febuu erpu<BRK>hell yeah  pressing after losing possession might be a huge part of the solution to the higuaín problem <BRK>i have a theory   and i swear i had it before i watched this behind the crest video that the above screenshot came from   that berhalter s usmnt will play with a more aggressive  higher press instead of the crew s middle block defense  it would make sense for a lot of reason <BRK>   the usmnt ha fewer player suited for build up from the back than the crew  so it should be more effective for them to start most attack from higher up the pitch <BRK>   the usmnt ha better athlete and fitter player than the crew  so they can actually win the ball if they press aggressively  while the crew probably would have wound up chaing shadow  the player pictured in the screenshot above  kellyn acosta  is among those perfect for applying pressure <BRK>   if you can force mistake and win the ball high up the pitch  with the defense scrambling and very few player behind the ball  you don t need a superstar no    to control the game or create chance <BRK>so  berhalter will likely want to win the ball up high on the pitch while maintaining most of the other principle from his crew team  mitigating the absence of a no    who is dominant for that level  he s got a few way he could set up his team to accomplish those thing <BRK>formation do not equal tactic  of course  there s so much more to a coach s philosophy than the initial shape displayed on the lineup card  but the formation that berhalter u is going to tell u a lot about what he want to accomplish  and what he think his personnel is capable of  <BRK>pro  christian pulisic is far and away the usmnt s best player  and this get him the most opportunity to get on the ball and make play  josh sargent ha shown the ability to play a an isolated lone striker  but getting an attacking midfielder close to him might benefit him a lot early in his career  he s only   year old   berhalter s team have always played some variation of this shape  so these player will certainly be well drilled <BRK>con  it demand a lot of discipline from tyler adam and weston mckennie when the team might be better served by making their youthful leg run a lot  there s little playmaking ability in this setup  and it s tough to see how the ball is ever going to get to pulisic in a dangerous area if the team doesn t create turnover <BRK>pro  this requires le discipline and allows adam and mckennie  or whomever play those more advanced central midfield role  to mess people up more often  if berhalter want to win the ball up the pitch  this formation should let them pressure aggressively with five player while the other five hold shape  pulisic might not get on the ball a often  but he ll be playing the role he s used to at the club level  playing someone like wil trapp in a true no    defensive midfield role instead of using the double pivot from berhalter s preferred formation could make the play out of the back learning curve a bit more gradual  too <BRK>con  the usmnt won t be able to create much if they aren t winning the ball high up the pitch  since there s not much in the way of midfield playmaking without anyone in the no    role and runner in central midfield  failure to win the ball high could also lead to sargent getting isolated  when trapp ha played this role for interim manager dave sarachan  rather than a part of a double pivot like in option    he ha struggled <BRK>pro  outside of pulisic  winger might be the shallowest area of the usmnt player pool  the team ha plenty of good defender  midfielders  and striker  why not find a way to get all the good player onto the pitch in role they like  this setup allows the usmnt to spread some of the higuaín duty around to a second striker and an attacking midfielder  rather than relying on one guy to fill the role or abandoning it altogether  the american fullback are all much better going forward than they are defensively  too  making them good fit for attacking role in a back three setup <BRK>con  unless your outside center back  advanced central midfielders  and striker are well drilled and have great chemistry  you won t be taking advantage of wide area that much  creating a square ball or cutback from a winger to a striker is the primary mean of chance creation in berhalter s system  so it seems unlikely he d turn to this  he d have to be really confident in his ability to coach a system that s radically different than his previous one <BRK>pro  listen  this is america  enough with the fancy crap  we have some hard working dude who know how to play a classic two striker system  if you don t have playmaker  getting two striker on who can play off each other is a really good idea  there s a reason that bob bradley and jürgen klinsmann both defaulted to this when they were otherwise stumped  these player are good at it and know how to play it <BRK>con  berhalter want to control the possession battle and build up from the back through midfield   two thing that are really difficult to do in a        it s not impossible  not by any stretch  but you need elite player and even more elite chemistry  unless your midfielders and second striker are all world  you can t control a game like this <BRK>it might seem like berhalter ha a lot of time  with the world cup not coming until    but he ll have just four friendly with all player available for selection before the   gold cup this summer  and world cup qualification isn t far away after that  the addition of the concacaf nation league to the calendar should be a welcome change for berhalter  who will get three more competitive game between gold cup and the start of world cup qualifying than any of his predecessor did <BRK>match against panama on jan    and costa rica on feb    will give u some idea of what berhalter is thinking  but we won t be able to draw any seriou concluions about the future of the umnt until he get his hand on his european based player for friendly against ecuador and chile in march  <BRK>his third game with a full squad will be against mexico and the man a lot of american fan wanted to take over the usmnt  former atlanta united manager gerardo martino  it will be played in arlington  texas  on june   in front of a heavily el tri leaning crowd of      the game will be called a friendly  but let s be real  it won t feel anything like a friendly <BRK>the realistic best case scenario is that berhalter hit the ground running and get his team playing the way he want very quickly  they go on to win the gold cup and qualify for the world cup comfortably  he s more qualified than bruce arena and bob bradley were when they took the job  and his attention to tactical detail utterly dwarf jürgen klinsmann s  it wouldn t be the least bit shocking if he s an instant  roaring success <BRK>it s also pretty easy to envision a world where berhalter s ideal don t fit the usmnt  and the american struggle to qualify out of concacaf like they did in    he s taking over a team at the height of a lost generation problem  and he s faced with the task of turning teenager into the focal point of a senior national team very quickly  there are plenty of good coach who would fail in the same situation <BRK>but that s all a long way off  step one for berhalter  solve the higuaín problem  and from there  the rest might fall into place <BRK>
