the nfl s official start to their new league year is here  but due to the league s negotiating or  legal tampering  period  many of the big name free agent are already off the market  that s because the negotiating period allows agent and team to enter into contract talk even though pen cannot be put to paper until the start of the new league year <BRK>lat year wa a frenzy during the negotiating period  with most of the top player gone by the time the market actually opened  a whole bunch of deal were cemented right at   p m  et when the league year started  and that s the cae this year a well  player can continue negotiating with other team after agreeing in principle to a new deal   nothing is final until the contract is signed and submitted to the league office  but once something is reported a a done deal  there is minimal flip flopping <BRK>it s likely this trend   the biggest player agreeing to deal before free agency actually start   will continue  <BRK>
