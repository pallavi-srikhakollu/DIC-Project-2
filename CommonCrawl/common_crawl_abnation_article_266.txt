it s time for the annual update  yep  the big nfl game that ended with a team winning the coin toss and promptly scoring one touchdown would ve been improved if the star qb on the team that didn t win the coin toss had also gotten a shot at the ball  <BRK> previously    s packer cardinal playoff game and super bowl     so no  this isn t some sort of chief fan sour grape  not a chief fan   <BRK> per college overtime rule  patrick mahomes  chief would ve had a chance to equalize or top the patriot  initial score  which would ve meant a game between two team would ve been decided by both full team  rather than one offense lucking into a favorable matchup by winning the toss  tweak the rule however you like beyond that   maybe you d choose to scoot nfl offense back to the other   yard line  which would be totally up to you   but that s the central contention  <BRK> why shouldn t the patriot have to put their own defense  which played well but wa giving up more and more big play a regulation wound down  on the field in ot a well   <BRK> kansa city s defense being a liability is kansa city s fault  but the point is simple  new england got to send out it no    in dvoa offense  rather than it no    defense  if kc had won the coin toss  then the patriot would ve been at an unfair disadvantage against an offense that d scored four time in the fourth quarter and had plenty of gas in the tank   <BRK> in any ot format  the coin toss will skew the odds in favor of one team  but in an nfl ot with two good offense and two mediocre defense  it ll skew it even more  <BRK> the team that win the coin toss win about   percent of the nfl game decided in overtime   <BRK> the team that get the ball second in college s system ha nearly the same odds  because there will be some advantage for one team no matter what you do  the big difference is that in the college system  the offense that doesn t start with the edge get to do something about it  <BRK> the patriot beat the chief by adding one more score to what wa already a   point game  why should one score among many be so automatically consequential  <BRK> if we re talking an ugly slugfest like the cheez it bowl  in which a score in ot meant producing nearly an entire   minute  worth of point  then letting one score resolve everything make a lot of narrative sense  finally  somebody scored  after both team had the ball   and we can all go home  <BRK> but the patriot  winning touchdown amounted to only a  th of the game s regulation point  why should a single drive carry this much weight right after a   point fourth quarter flurry  after both defense spent   minute flailing around  one more flail by one of them decides it  <BRK> none of this would apply to the saint  loss to the ram in the nfc championship on the same day  the saint lost in overtime despite winning the coin toss  due to drew brees throwing an interception  meaning they would ve lost the game no matter the ot format  <BRK>
