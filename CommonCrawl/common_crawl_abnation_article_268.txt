injured all pro struggled through a long list of malady through his nfl career  dealing with injury to his back  forearm  groin  and knee that often kept him from the field   he missed   regular season game in his nine season in new england  while he claimed he wa the healthiest he d been all season before the super bowl  he decided against throwing his body into the fire for one more season  leaving a massive hole in the patriot  passing attack in the process <BRK>he finished his career with five pro bowl invitation  four first team all pro appearance  three super bowl title  and the title of   s nfl comeback player of the year  the patriot  including head coach bill belichick and team owner robert kraft  were deferential when addressing his departure <BRK>statement from bill belichick on  robgronkowski  pic twitter com asivcakf u<BRK>he leaf behind a sport that rewarded his hard work with injury that include but are not limited to <BRK>so it s understandable he d be interested in retiring before age    the good news for gronkowski is he wa able to put together a strong hall of fame resume in a relatively brief career  he ll retire with three super bowl championship ring  multiple first team all pro honor  and a litany of story from depressed linebacker and defensive back about how impossible he wa to cover  at     and   pound   gronk  wa a nightmare to track up the seam a well a a crushing blocker who freed up space for his tailback <BRK>gronk just blocked a poor  unwitting chief defensive back into oblivion pic twitter com xkjnbggdto<BRK>his   game regular seaon average come out to   catch      yard  and   touchdown  he wa just a good in the postseaon  with   catch      yard  and   touchdown in his first   playoff game  gronk wa a monster  and the only thing that could effectively slow him wa injury <BRK>he retires having averaged     touchdown per game  nice <BRK>gronkowski is irreplaceable  and his retirement will put bill belichick s  next man up  philosophy to the test  the patriot have gone stretch without their all pro tight end in the past  see above   but moving on to life without gronk mean tom brady will be without the security blanket target he d turn to in clutch situation across the past decade  gronkowski averaged nearly seven target per game in his nfl career   more than any other player on the roster <BRK>brady had nothing but praise for the player who d bailed out his offense in so many big moment in the past <BRK> what an honor and privilege to play with you these pat nine year  gronk  you accomplished so much and our team wa almost unbeatable when you were on the field  your fun loving  inspiring  and positive energy made an impact on everybody you came into contact with  not just that  but for a great a a player you are  you are a better teammate and person  the nfl wa a better place with you in it  but i have no doubt you will be a success in anything you do    love you pal <BRK>a

teammate and person  the nfl wa a better place with you in it  but i have no doubt you will be a success in anything you do    love you pal <BRK>the solution to the team s newest problem likely isn t already on the roster  dwayne allen had only   catch in his two seaon a a patriot before becoming a salary cap caualty this winter <BRK>behind allen on the team s roster were jacob hollister and ryan izzo  who each ended   on injured reserve  hollister ha been one of belichick s pet project a an undrafted free agent out of wyoming  but he only ha eight career nfl reception  izzo  a   seventh round pick   ha yet to play a game a a pro  <BRK>gronkowski s departure will also put a strain on an already overworked group of wide receiver  julian edelman regained his spot a the team s top wideout this fall  but at age   will face question about how much longer he can keep this up  behind him are phillip dorsett    signees bruce ellington and maurice harris  and   late round pick braxton berrios  new england will have to make some tough decision on who will be retained and who will be let go in order to revamp the team s receiving corp <BRK>although there s a chance gronkowski s retirement isn t quite permanent <BRK>agent drew rosenhaus on  nflnetwork on gronk s retirement   i wa shocked  i thought rob wa going to come back and play   his speculation  gut feeling  is that gronk come back at some point  but rob told rosenhaus he is  done  done  done  <BRK>the good news for the patriot is there s a solid pool of tight end in the   nfl draft  iowa standouts noah fant and t j  hockenson are both expected to be first round pick  though both may be gone before the team pick at no     new england s combination of need  position  and the fact belichick ha a strong relationship with hawkeyes coach kirk ferentz could be enough to necessitate a rare trade up for the pat  either target could help mitigate the loss of gronkowski while serving a a vital step in a patriot roster overhaul <BRK>but neither will bring the blend of strength  speed  and concentration gronkowski brought to the position  the oft injured tight end s star burned bright  and he ll retire with a hall of fame resume and more than    million in career earnings from the patriot alone  now he s free to expand his party bus business  show up at wrestlemania  and just generally be the human personification of a golden retriever wherever and whenever he like <BRK>
