i turned a year older today  a couple hour before i woke up at     am to watch a baeball game  although we re conditioned to see turning a year older a bad  and certainly mortality creeping closer can be disconcerting  i like this new higher number next to my age  i promised myself i wouldn t freak out over birthday anymore the year i turned    my dad had died a few month earlier and thing like that will make you realize what a gift it is to see that rising number  <BRK> i often wonder if i d be a baseball fan without my dad s influence  he loved the game more than anyone i ve ever known  with a romanticism i seem to have inherited  the first opening day i watched after my dad died  the mariner also played in japan  i woke up early to watch both of those game too  appreciating the differentness from the typical season opening that eased the hurdle over a difficult milestone   <BRK> growing older is a privilege  but sometimes it s a tough transition  i m fine with the growing number  i kind of like the line that are etching themselves next to my eye  i have enjoyed discovering truth and small wisdom that come with age  although i often wish i had discovered them sooner  <BRK> for my birthday  the mariner gave me a beautiful gift  this is the first time they ve played a regular season game on my birthday  playing in the middle of the night gave me the chance to watch two entire game uninterrupted by my child  who  blessedly  generally sleep through the night now  or the little thing i always feel like i should be accomplishing during the day  i got to see yusei kikuchi make his first start in japan  braden bishop  a player i watched at the university of washington  made his major league debut  adding another fun player to look back on in my trove of college and minor league game score sheet  <BRK> i suspected  along with everyone else  i can t take credit  that it would also be ichiro s last game and the chance to say goodbye to a player who ha meant so much to me  <BRK> i wa a freshman at the university of massachuetts when ichiro debuted for the mariner  alex rodriguez had signed with the texas ranger  leaving me to fend off barb from the red sox fan surrounding me  i kept telling them a rod wa no big loss  ichiro suzuki would make u forget all about him  i missed the first couple month of ichiro s tenure while i wa away at school becaue we didn t have thing like mlb tv in those day  in fact  my dorm didn t even have high speed internet   <BRK> i got a job that summer at safeco field where i wa lucky enough to closely watch ichiro for the rest of the season  his intricate stretching routine out there in the field were enthralling  he wa always planning  always preparing  the way he approached batting wa like listening to a fresh interpretation of an old song  he wa a revelation    <BRK> i ve often been emotionally reticent  but baeball wa the one thing where i wan t afraid to let myself feel  i ve been a nostalgic baeball romantic since before i wa old enough to have any real sense of nostalgia  so when the steroid scandal started to break  i felt betrayed by the thing i loved with a pure a love a i ve ever felt   <BRK> i wa angry at baseball  angry at the player and the coach and bud selig for letting it all happen  i felt like my nostalgic childhood baseball had been nothing but fiction  the prodigious power hitting mariner team  simply a disney movie  the epic   home run race  an epic sham   <BRK> of course  a we grow up we realize that thing aren t the way we thought they were in the innocence of childhood  the nostalgic baeball pat i so revered wa rife with racism  the nostalgia of the good old day of player loyalty wa built on the back of player who could not leave their team  <BRK> what i salvaged from the steroid scandal wa a slap hitting single hitter who played a brand of baseball that wa the opposite of the steroid player  he wa my respite  there aren t many betrayal and truth that we can ethically hide from  but i could safely find refuge in ichiro  i distanced myself from baseball in those year  but ichiro kept me tethered  i would have found my way back without him  but he kept the flame of romance alive  i don t know what baseball would be to me without him   <BRK>  ichiro s baseball career is over  i don t need him to anchor me to baseball or the mariner anymore  with age ha come the realization that nearly everything i thought about the world wa wrong  i ve realized how important it is to correct those wrong  and to also hold on tight to the thing that are good  <BRK> in the mirror this morning i see a face that look different than it did all those year ago  watching ichiro in right field  the line around my eye have become slowly more pronounced and i idly wonder if i should invest in some magic potion or other to fix that   <BRK> sometimes i feel like i could go out to a bar in pioneer square  do a couple shot  and dance on the bar like i used to the year i turned    then  i never understood people in their  s or  s saying they felt like they were still    now  i get it  the way you look change  and along with it the way the world perceives you change  but your perception of yourself change more slowly  your whole life you re young until suddenly you aren t  it take a little getting used to   <BRK> i understand better now the athlete who can t seem to let go  your whole life you re a super star athlete until suddenly you aren t  if i were to go out and dance on a bar  it d be a awkward a bret favre trying to throw a football to a receiver again  <BRK> ichiro wanted to play until he wa    but those tiny insidiou change that come with age crept up on him  if anyone could have defeated them  it wa him  but father time come for u all  <BRK> so this morning we said goodbye  for many of u  we were releasing a piece of our youth  we reckoned with the passing of time and the creep of age  we reached the last page in a book  reading the final word  the end  <BRK> we also saw that time still march  that new youth is ready and waiting  the major league debut of yuei kikuchi  braden bishop  and brandon brennan reminded u that there is a new start  these first and last are the milestone with which we mark the passing of time  the first becaue of the hope  the last becaue of that hope fulfilled  it is everything in between that give those milestone meaning  those long season where ichiro came up to the plate every nine batter  the way he dedicated himself every single day  the paint stroke he added to the art of his baseball career happened slowly  collecting themselves over all those season  <BRK> it ha been eight opening day now since i lost my dad  since then  i have myself gotten married and had kid  we bought a house  ending and beginning  all of them  and in between i ve changed profoundly a a person  on these day player have played their lat opening day  and made their first start  the mas of player sometimes becomes indistinguishable  to stand out and be remembered is a special accomplishment that happens between the bookend  it s all the time in between the ending and beginning that matter  <BRK> ichiro is a player who will live on through time  and when we look back on him with nostalgia we will see a player worth every bit of the emotion and the love and the rosy haze through which we ll remember him  <BRK> woven into the excitement of opening day are also wave of sadness  i miss my dad the most when baseball begin  and it s tough to be reminded year after year that grief is perpetually unfinished business  amidst my sadness i remember watching baseball with him  and even now after he s been gone for so long  i never watch a game without thinking of him  <BRK> this season start with a strong dose of melancholy and sadness  but also with hope  new player  a new season  a new year   <BRK> for me  a reminder that even when it end  it s never really over  the joy of growing older mean having the wisdom to contextualize and cherish all that is good   <BRK> ichiro  forever  <BRK>
