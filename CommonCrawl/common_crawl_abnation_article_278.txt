after writing my quick post selection show reaction piece and eating dinner on sunday evening  i spent most of the rest of the night playing with number  i pulled up the official ncaa seed list  my own final projected seed list  the final net number and nitty gritty report  warrennolan com s version of the rpi and the selection time kenpom ranking  then  i opened a spreadsheet and got to work  <BRK> for starter  if you were to project a bracket solely based on the net  you d do a slightly better job than if you used the rpi  but you would still do far worse than if you attempted to replicate the selection committee s process  <BRK> to test this out  i examined how the top   team on the seed list   everyone on line one through    which is the typical end of the window for at large contention   and compared the true seed list with my projection  the net and rpi   plus  the gap between seed number and net ranking start to become so large by the time you get to line   that the analysis would be nearly meaningless   <BRK> you might hate hearing this  but they seem to be using it in the same way a they used the rpi  selection committee chair bernard muir made this pretty clear in every single interview he gave lat night  it s being used a a sorting device  not a  throw it into a computer so it will spit out a perfect bracket  tool  many of the other factor the committee us to select and seed team are still very much in play  so the quality of win and loss  winning percentage in quadrant   and   game and scheduling will all continue to play a role in the ncaa tournament selection process   <BRK> in my opinion  yes  because it certainly seems to be more grounded in college baketball analytics  a designed  switching our attention back to the larger ncaa picture  i compared the selection sunday net of the   team in the field and the top eight nit seed  the top four of whom are explicitly labeled a the first team left out  with the day s rpi and kenpom ranking  <BRK> the average difference between a team s net and rpi ranking for these   team wa a little more than   place  while the average gap between the net and kenpom plunged to just     spot   <BRK> the net manages to treat team relatively equally when compared to kenpom  with a nearly even split between team with higher ranking in one or the other metric  plus  there aren t quite a many extreme outlier a in the rpi  only the unc greensboro spartan  the first team out of this year s field  and north dakota state bison have gap of more than   spot between their net and kenpom rating  with the spartan   spot lower in kenpom and the bison   place higher  <BRK> but there s much more variability when comparing the net to the rpi  just   team from our   team sample boast rpis that rank within five place of their net  compared to   such team in kenpom  plus  there are   team with net   or more spot either better or worse than their rpis  and the north carolina state wolfpack   rd in the net but  th in the rpi aren t even the biggest outlier  the swac champion prairie view a m panther  a first four no    seed  have an rpi     that s   place higher than their net of    while the georgia state panther net of   is   spot lower than their rpi of    <BRK> i also took a little time to analyze each region and specific pod to see if anything interesting popped up  which naturally happened  some of this information i m saving for my forthcoming pick post  since it would apply more there  but i will share some data on how the region break down now  <BRK> based on the average net ranking of the team in each region  averaging the ranking of the team playing the first four game   there s a sizable difference between the strongest and weakest region  <BRK> i decided to dig a little deeper  so i totaled the net ranking of each pod within the four region and the result were a little surprising  the lower the total  the stronger the pod  <BRK> you would expect that the quartet of pod anchored by no    seed would be at the top of this table in some order  and the no    seed  pod would all rank near the bottom  but this is clearly not the case  while three of the four no    seed bring up the rear  virginia  again  is the outlier  with the east region s second seed  the michigan state spartan  finding themselves in a weaker pod  at least according to the net  than the cavalier   <BRK> at the top of the table  the virginia tech hokies  eat pod is significantly weaker than those of the other three no    seed  in fact  the lsu tiger  asignment a a no    seed in the same region is slightly more difficult by the number  there s even a fair mix in the middle eight spot on the table  which should theoretically be filled by the two and three seed exclusively  instead  there are no    and   seed  virginia and virginia tech  mixed in with trio of team from seed line two and three   <BRK> that s the kind of information that will lead me to doing some research in the offseason  before that  however  we have   ncaa tournament game to watch and pick  i ll post my selection  with more net information relating to them  on tuesday  <BRK>
