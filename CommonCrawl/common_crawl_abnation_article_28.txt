there wa a time not long ago when watching viral video of a hooded carmelo anthony running up and down a private court in the summer  getting up shot  and sometimes scrimmaging against other nba player  elicited excitement and hope  back then  there wa still optimism around anthony s ability to be a capable player in the league  the idea wa that all he needed wa a change of scenery from the toxic environment of the new york knicks  <BRK>  kyrieirving    carmeloanthony    dangerous summer pick up team       academy basketball<BRK>a post shared by  chris brickley   cbrickley   on jul      at    pm pdt<BRK>then came his unimpressive season with the oklahoma city thunder  a team he joined by reasserting his stance that he is too good for a bench role  by then  it wa still logical to say that the team wan t a good fit for him  he wa partnered with two ball dominant player in paul george and russell westbrook  and there wa little offensive identity beyond the three of them doing whatever they wanted when they got the ball  and within a team with a strong defensive identity  anthony wa often exposed for his lack of ability and physical mobility  <BRK>it wasn t until his rocket tenure that the bleak reality of anthony shattered the myth of him  <BRK>it s a myth that wa driven by both his own confidence  his insistence on never changing for anyone  and the propaganda of those summer workout video that made it seem a if he couldn t miss a shot  it took only   game for the rocket to decide that he wa of no use to them  after an early november game against the thunder in which he made   of   shot  anthony wa exiled from the team  he wa kept on the roster  but the rocket decided that keeping him inactive wa a better solution than having him play in any capacity  even a injury ravaged the houston team  <BRK>on monday night  anthony wa traded by the rocket to the chicago bull  who plan to waive him  leaving anthony without a team  his possible saving grace seems to be the insistent rumor that his friend  lebron james  might pull some string to get him on the lakers  save for that  it s hard to see a team that could actually use him <BRK>at first  it wa a bit admirable   and maybe still is  in a way   that anthony refused to change when everyone in the greater nba world wa telling him that he wa no longer the player that he thought he wa  popular opinion wa that the game had moved past him  he wa older  slower  and playing an outmoded style of isolation heavy basketball that had become frowned upon  if he wanted to survive in the hostile environment of the new nba  it wa said  then he had no choice but to adapt  <BRK>anthony stood firm against those idea  he spoke and played like a man who wa raging against the dying of the light  <BRK>that level of self belief that border on delusion is almost foundational to becoming a great athlete  a person ha to believe that they are the exception of exception to make it to the nba  and then believe that they are even more exceptional than that to work and become one of the best player in the league  to dare to make it to that level of reverence is to believe that you can bend reality to your will and succeed where million of people before you have failed  we even celebrate that obsessive belief in oneself when the athlete ha the ability to prove the world wrong  <BRK>but when that ability isn t there  that belief is only delusion  in the case of anthony  in which he ha played so badly that team would rather he not be anywhere near the court  he ha become deeply sad to watch  he ha gone from being a beloved figure to an internet joke  <BRK>it s said  because anthony could have a great ending to his career  many older player have reimagined themselves and their game in order to stay productive in the nba   player like vince carter  dwyane wade  joe johnson  and andre iguodala  anthony doesn t have to be lebron james  but there s no reason why he ha to be a pariah at an age when others have found a way forward  <BRK>a much decorated and talented scorer like anthony deserves to finish his career in a better way than being traded from two team and then releaed by the bull  but for that to happen   for anthony to get his chance to be paraded and celebrated on nba court around the country in his twilight seaon   he will have to change  he will have to give up the idea that he is a capable now a he wa five year ago  and he will have to learn what it mean to be a capable role player  <BRK>otherwise  the world will leave him behind  a it seems to be doing now  <BRK>
