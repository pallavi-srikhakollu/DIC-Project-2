 in    victory wa served on the game s final play when the pat capped the greatest comeback in super bowl history with a two yard scoring plunge <BRK>tom brady s inclusion in the super bowl ha been a boon for advertiser stuck with fourth quarter time slot  every time the patriot play for an nfl title  the final   minute of the game becomes appointment viewing  the four time super bowl mvp ha been the catalyst behind   fourth quarter and overtime point with the franchise <BRK>sorting the franchise s biggest game by order of watchability is a tall task  but a valuable exercise in clutch play on both side of the ball  here s the definitive list of new england super bowl  ranging from nap material to late game rally that induce more sweat and panicky breathing than a bottle of blair s death sauce <BRK>   super bowl    patriot    ram  <BRK>this game started with a tom brady interception and ended with a missed greg zuerlein field goal  it featured the fewest point ever scored by the

sandwich a wasteland of terrible football  we remember no    because a   pound defensive lineman scored a touchdown  we remember no    because desmond howard ripped out the heart of patriot fan with a   yard kickoff return touchdown in the third quarter  ultimately  these were bad game  no matter what chicago and green bay fan say <BRK>   super bowl xxxix  patriot    eagle  <BRK>the fact terrell owen isn t in the hall of fame is proof this game remains the most easily forgotten of new england s super bowl win  edit    month after this article wa first published  he made it   the outspoken wide receiver made a stunning recovery from a broken leg to catch nine pass for   yard  unfortunately  that wan t enough to overcome brady and his own coach s bizarre clock management <BRK>philadelphia trailed     with jut under six minute to play when it got the ball back on it own   yard line  rather than execute a hurry up offense  andy reid took a more relaxed approach  by the time greg lewis    yard touchdown catch made this a one possession game  the two minute warning had come and gone  a failed onside kick pretty much sealed this one  though the aborted rally did give u the urban legend of donovan mcnabb puking during the most important game of his life <BRK>   super bowl xlvi  giant    patriot  <BRK>new york overcame a     second half deficit thanks in part to mario manningham s over the shoulder  tiptoe catch down the sideline  however  this game wa slightly boring  featuring only four touchdown but cementing eli manning s status a the only man who can derail the patriot  dynaty <BRK>sb nation s home for all thing new england patriot<BRK>visit pat pulpit<BRK>   super bowl xxxviii  patriot    panther  <BRK>this game went from boring to banana extremely quickly  and the fact it s only ranked fifth is a testament to how great the rest of these game are  no one scored for the first     before the floodgate opened  the two team combined for   point in the final three plus minute  took the third quarter off  and then blew up for   more in a bonkers fourth <BRK>an   yard bomb from jake delhomme to muhsin muhammad gave carolina it first lead of the game with     left  but a two yard pas to linebacker touchdown machine mike vrabel put the pat up by seven with fewer than three minute to play  delhomme ran a masterful two minute drill to knot this game back up and kick off a million  no super bowl ha ever gone to overtime  talking point <BRK>but like the ram two year prior  the panther gave brady and adam vinatieri too much time to counterpunch  john kasay s ensuing kickoff went out of bound  leaving a short field for brady  who calmly drove his offense   yard to set up vinatieri s game winning   yard kick <BRK>also  we saw janet jackson s nipple  and it wa wearing armor like a tiny spartan soldier  which wa neat <BRK>   super bowl xxxvi  patriot    ram  <BRK>the game that made brady a star and got thousand of new england fan telling john madden to shut his fat mouth  new england wa a two touchdown underdog thanks to the unheralded second year quarterback behind center and a roster that weighed heavily both young  unproven player  brady  richard seymour  kevin faulk  other team s castaway  vrabel  antowain smith  otis smith   across the sideline were the ram  led by a hall of fame quarterback and the greatest show on turf <BRK>the patriot were able to grind their way to a     fourth quarter lead  but   kurt warner wa not a force to be contained for long  he rallied st  louis to two late touchdown drive that made the ram  ascension to mini dynasty a foregone conclusion  when new england got the ball back on it own   yard line with     to play  madden implored the team to play for overtime rather than risk losing <BRK>instead  brady did what he doe best  turning anonymous player into star en route to a jaw dropping win  he completed pas to troy brown  j r  redmond  and jermaine wiggins to set up vinatieri s   yard game winning field goal  the ball dropped through the upright a time expired  and the patriot earned their first ever nfl championship <BRK>   super bowl xlii  giant    patriot  <BRK>new england s     season wa chewed up and spit out by a giant defense that adjusted masterfully after giving up   point to brady and his offense in the final game of the regular season  the patriot were     point favorite  but scored the fewest point they had all season in a stunning defeat <BRK>those   point were nearly enough to win  too  the patriot took a     lead late in the fourth quarter on a six yard touchdown toss to randy moss  then looked to have the game wrapped up when an eli manning pas wound up in the hand of all pro cornerback asante samuel  but samuel couldn t corral the ball  and his drop gave new york new life  the opportunity led to this display of all time wizardry from manning and david tyree <BRK>four play later  an end zone fade route to plaxico burress gave the giant a dramatic win and erased new england s bid to be the greatest team of all time <BRK>   super bowl lii  eagle    patriot  <BRK>it looked like the patriot were going to pull off a classic late game comeback  new england took their first lead of the game with just over nine minute left to play  but the underdog eagle  led by backup quarterback nick foles  were relentless  they took a     lead back with just over two minute remaining  then forced a rare tom brady fumble and recovered it  the eagle turned that into three more point  taking a     lead  and held off the patriot offense to get the first super bowl win in franchise history  <BRK>   super bowl xlix  patriot    seahawks  <BRK>malcolm butler had a bad game against the falcon on sunday  he could have stood at midfield singing campfire song for   minute and it still would have been a net win for new england  the undrafted cornerback s end zone interception of russell wilson preserved the patriot  fourth super bowl win and may be the most clutch play in super bowl history <BRK>butler s play is the headliner  but brady s ability to drive his team back from a   point fourth quarter deficit wa the true difference maker  the veteran quarterback had played poorly early  even taking point off the scoreboard with an ill advised interception in the end zone  then  with the game on the line  he completed   of his final   pass to lead new england to a pair of touchdown and set up butler s heroic pick <BRK>no super bowl ha ever swung so wildly on a single play  <BRK>   super bowl li  patriot    falcon    ot <BRK>didn t think anything could top butler s dramatic interception  it turn out you d need a game that tied or set   different super bowl record to do so  brady looked like garbage in the first half  his pas came in soft and were strangely inaccurate for the legendary paser  a bullying falcon pas rush kept him from getting comfortable and doing brady thing  even capitalizing on a misread for an   yard robert alford pick six <BRK>that changed in the second half  the patriot shored up the hole in their offensive line and brady went to work  a     deficit shrunk like platic in the oven  aided by some questionable playcalling from atlanta offensive coordinator kyle shanahan  a the clock wound down on an  everything ha to go right  situation  every outcome came up new england <BRK>a if the fate weren t telegraphing the outcome enough  the patriot even got their own version of tyree s helmet catch <BRK>brady kept completing pass  finding hole in the atlanta secondary en route to a record   passing yard  james white  the unheralded third down back who spent the season overshadowed by legarrette blount and dion lewis  set his own title game record with   reception  a defense that wa gashed for   point in a     span went the final   minute of the game without surrendering a single point <BRK>no team in the nfl ha ever done what the patriot did in super bowl li  at this juncture
