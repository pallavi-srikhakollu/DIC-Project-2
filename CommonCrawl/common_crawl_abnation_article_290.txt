promising wing player james nunnally s nba season came to an end on monday after he wa waived by the houston rocket in the middle of his   day contract  it look like he will go back to europe  although his agent denied a sportando report that he signed with an italian team  <BRK> it didn t have to end like this  though  nunnally brought depth  three point shooting and versatility to a key wing position on the rocket  roster  but houston made two abrupt roster move that forced them into this predicament  and timed them poorly  <BRK> they signed nunnally to replace danuel house  who declined a multi year nba contract offer once his two way deal wa up so he could test free agency sooner   <BRK> now  the rocket have neither  here s why  <BRK> clint capela s thumb surgery left houston pretty bare at the center position  the only healthy big men on their roster were nene and marquese chriss  <BRK> so when report broke that the brooklyn net had reached a buyout agreement with kenneth faried  the rocket were all over it  in the same breath a espn s adrian wojnarowski reported the faried buyout  he announced the forward s likelihood of signing with houston immediately thereafter  <BRK> brooklyn s kenneth faried ha agreed to a contract buyout with the brooklyn net  clearing the way for him to sign a free agent deal with the houston rocket  league source tell espn  faried expected to be waived on saturday and clear on monday  <BRK> it take   hour for a player to clear waiver  a period that allows another team to place a bid on a waived player for a fraction of his contract buyout amount  brooklyn officially waived faried on saturday  he officially became a rocket on monday  <BRK> houston hustled to create one at the last second  they traded carmelo anthony and cash to the chicago bull  who could absorb his contract without giving anything back because of their trade exception from the justin holiday deal with memphis   <BRK> that  in theory  should have created the spot for faried  <BRK> but the rocket didn t account for monday being a national holiday  monday wa martin luther king jr  day  and  thus  the nba league office wa closed  that meant there wa no one to process the trade  so it could not officially be executed until tuesday  <BRK> the rocket played philadelphia on monday night and felt they needed faried to go up against joel embiid  in order to get faried ready to play in time for that game  the rocket needed to release nunnally   <BRK> rocket head coach mike d antoni wa upset the anthony trade wa unable to be processed on monday   <BRK> mike d antoni is frustrated about how houston s roster crunch because the league office wasn t open today to process the carmelo anthony trade cost james nunnally his roster spot   it s not right   d antoni said  <BRK> the rocket had already agreed to sign faried  and the anthony trade wa delayed a day  someone had to go  so the odd man out wa james nunnally   <BRK> it s unfortunate  because nunnally wa wa playing like he belonged  nunnally went   of   from three point range against the lakers  but he made big play in houston s double overtime loss to the brooklyn net earlier in the week  he wa exactly the kind of player who fit into a rocket team that needed to create a much space for harden on the court  <BRK> houston wanted to keep him too  which is why they executed the anthony trade  but they couldn t keep him and get faried processed in time for the  er game  <BRK> the rocket were in a frenzy to sign faried because they wanted him to fill the void capela left  with joel embiid and the  er coming to town  the rocket wanted to put up some type of fight  they didn t feel like nene and marquese chriss wa enough  <BRK> in reality  no combination of big men is enough to check embiid  who went off for   point    rebound  and three block  faried played   minute and had   point  even shooting   of   from three point range  but it didn t matter  houston lost by   in a game they trailed a many a     <BRK> given the result and the unlikelihood that faried would have offered much resistance against embiid anyway  why the rush  houston could have waited one extra day to finalize the faried signing had they planned for the nba office to be closed on a notable national holiday  that would have allowed the melo trade to go through  clearing the spot for faried  <BRK> instead  nunnally lost his job  and houston will have to find a way to replace him  too  the rocket aren t happy with the nba  but this could have been avoided  <BRK>
