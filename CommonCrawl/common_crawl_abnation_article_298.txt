according to sport business daily  american athletic conference school are about to get a nice boost to their coffer  thanks to their new tv deal with espn  <BRK>the new agreement is reportedly a   year deal  running from     through the     academic year  is worth an average of      million a year  that come out to just short of    million a year per school  the current deal pay a little le than    million  so that represents a very significant jump <BRK>the big question with the aac wa whether a new tv deal would require a grant of right agreement  a gor would essentially make it impossible for a conference school to leave for another league over the duration of the tv contract  with half the conference tied at least informally to the big    any agreement that would have limited flexibility would have been very politically difficult <BRK>the current aac contract now run beyond the next round of power conference tv deal  including the big   s  which expires in    but without that gor  a school like say  ucf  could still theoretically leave if a larger  more lucrative conference had a spot  <BRK>but there s no guarantee any realignment happens after the next round of major tv deal  an annual check of close to    million a year isn t a terrible fallback plan  <BRK>one reason espn might be motivated to pay substantially more for aac right  per the sbd report <BRK>football and men s basketball will remain on espn  espn  and espnu  but the majority of basketball game and about half of the football game will go to espn   other live sport including baseball  softball and soccer also will air on espn  <BRK>no disrespect to the horizon league  ivy league  mac  sun belt  and other conference who have content on espn   but aac football and basketball should clearly be the flagship programming for the subscription service  <BRK>if you re already a college sport die hard  or a fan of other non power football  you already have compelling reaon to pay for espn   and now just got another one  but if you re already awah in streaming subscription and are determined not to pay for more  you re going to miss out on what s becoming a pretty solid baketball league  a well a good college football  after all  the aac sent four team to the ncaa tournament this year  more than the pac    and the same number a the big eat  <BRK>uconn basketball and ucf football fan probably won t be thrilled with this arrangement  <BRK>the aac like to brand themselves a part of the  power six    a a peer to the big ten  sec  pac    etc  for some sport  the competitiveness gap isn t very large  but even with this new tv deal  the financial gap certainly is  even the much maligned pac   will distribute more than double what the aac will each year  and that s without large swath of their football and baketball content behind a paywall  plus  the aac being featured on a platform with the like of the mac and sun belt  instead of say  the acc  sort of undercut that power six messaging  <BRK>but if anything  this deal make it even more clear that there s a pretty big gap between the aac and the rest of the so called group of five  like the sun belt or mountain west  if you re a program that need to compete against an aac school for coach  recruit  or a coveted new year s six bowl spot  that job just got much harder over the next few year  that additional    million a year for the aac could go a long way towards facility or coaching upgrade that you might not be able to afford  <BRK>the market for live college sport programming is projected to change quite a bit over the next decade  to the extent that anybody without a    million tv deal can claim stability though  the aac can  by tying themselves to the most powerful entity in college football  espn  <BRK>but the league will still need to sell fan on the idea of major sport behind a paywall  and there s no guarantee that conference membership will remain the same in the next ten year  <BRK>but for now  a bunch of school that could probably really use the money  are getting more money  hopefully that lead to a better product on the field   <BRK>
