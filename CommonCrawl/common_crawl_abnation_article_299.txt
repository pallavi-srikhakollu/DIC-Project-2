you remember doumit  right  he wa a pirate mainstay during the twilight year of the bucs  losing streak and a pretty good hitter  especially for a catcher  but his glove  it wa    <BRK>    bad  it wa bad  he wa a bad defensive catcher  really bad  actually  anyone who watched him knew it  war didn t know it  though  the formula for win above replacement kind of liked him  pegging him at     career fwar when he hung up the cleat after    while     is hardly astounding  it s a respectable total for a   year role player  <BRK> that wa before wednesday  though  when fangraphs updated how they calculated war for catcher  they now add pitch framing into the mix for backstop dating back to    some catcher have better career stats a a result  former bucco russell martin is now  th all time in war at his position  on the flip side of the coin  no catcher s war wa more negatively impacted than doumit s  <BRK> take his   seaon  for example  it wa one of his best turn a a hitter  slahing          over   plate appearance  factoring in his offensive  bae running and defensive contribution  he wa worth     war  that s a very solid seaon  but it doesn t take pitch framing into consideration  his receiving alone cost pirate pitcher nearly   run that year  all of a sudden  his     war becomes      war  that is the worst seaon for a catcher in baeball history  he followed it up with      war in both   and    ranking a the  th and  nd worst seaons of all time  too  <BRK> and in case you forgot the headline to this post  he now ha the worst war all time of any pirate  <BRK> it s a photo finish between him and jose guillen  but doumit is a hair worse  to be fair  doumit played nearly   more game in pittsburgh than guillen  giving him more opportunity to be bad  on the other hand  he s still benefiting from the first three season of his career where framing wasn t taken into consideration  his career war should be even lower  <BRK> but it wan t all bad  there wa the time he plunked john grabow  <BRK> he s one third of the best bobblehead in pirate history    <BRK>    and he got a standalone bobble later  <BRK> and he is the only player to ever homer off of hall of famer trevor hoffman in back to back day  <BRK> doumit ha mostly kept out of the public eye since retiring  but we do know he played some shortstop in a beer softball league and coached at big bend community college  here s hoping he s living his best life  and long live the  new   worst  player in pirate history  <BRK>
