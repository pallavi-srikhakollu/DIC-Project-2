in august    odell beckham jr  signed a five year     million contract with the new york giant that appeared to put trade rumor to rest for good <BRK> we feel good about having him on our team for the next five year   giant owner john mara told reporter <BRK>beckham responded with a bounce back season with     receiving yard  despite missing four game  he even threw two touchdown for an offense that struggled to be anything more than average with eli manning at the helm <BRK>but it didn t even take a year for trade rumor to bubble back up  <BRK>it s not surprising that beckham is a player many team would want to acquire  the   year old receiver already ha     career receiving yard and   touchdown in just   career game  his     yard per game is the second best average all time behind only julio jones <BRK>that s also exactly why it s so puzzling that trade rumor follow the receiver so persistently  why would the giant want to get rid of one of the league s most elite  young talent  <BRK>march       josina anderson reported an afc north team ha been in an ongoing discussion with the giant for a trade for beckham  jordan zirm of uproxx said a source told him a deal with the brown is on the table that would send new york a first round pick  second round pick  and emanuel ogbah for the receiver  <BRK>but nfl network s kimberly jones reported that the rumor don t mean a deal is close to happening <BRK>my take on  nyg odell beckham jr    the never ending trade  rumor     pic twitter com fu qiybrd<BRK> everything that i have heard ha been consistent that they are not looking to trade odell beckham jr    jones reported   i believe they want him in the fold  they know they re better with him on the field  would two no    pick do it  perhaps  but there doesn t seem to be a team lining up with that kind of mega offer  <BRK>march       the giant are  still involved in trade discussion  involving beckham  according to jeff howe of the athletic <BRK>march       a day after allbright said the brown were rumored to be after beckham  nfl network s aditi kinkhabwala confirmed the news  she got a little more specific and said that the brown offered kevin zeitler  emmanuel ogbah  and one more player <BRK>kinkhabwala also said that the giant laughed at the offer <BRK> i wouldn t feel confident describing them  the rumor  a serious   kinkhabwala told     the fan in cleveland <BRK>zeitler wa later traded to the giant in exchange for pas rusher olivier vernon <BRK>march       there were rumbling that the brown were about to make a big move  and one reporter said that it wa because cleveland wa making a run at beckham <BRK>since others wont  i will basically the rumor that s out there  with many different variation is a kevin zeitler and draft pick plus another player for odell beckam i cannot stress enough that that is a rumor  and not currently coming from any known credible source<BRK>feb        glazer said he wasn t backing down on his earlier prediction  even though  a lot ha to materialize for it to take place  <BRK>feb        bleacher report s chris simms said the patriot pushed hard for a trade for beckham in    nbc s mike florio responded to that by saying the  er have been   and continue to be   interested in trading for the receiver <BRK>feb        jay glazer wrote on the athletic that his bold prediction of the offseason is that beckham will be traded  <BRK>oct        jay glazer said on fox that several team called the giant ahead of the trade deadline with  some decent offer   but were rebuffed  <BRK>oct        the receiver sat down with rapper lil wayne and espn s josina anderson for an interview and gave some surprisingly honest and candid answer  that reignited a rift between the player and team  and just like that trade rumor were back <BRK>shortly after the end of the   season  giant general manager dave gettleman tried to dump some water on the trade rumor ember before they turned into a fire <BRK>gettleman on  obj   we didn t sign him to trade him    nyg<BRK>apparently that didn t work  <BRK>with the possibility of a beckham trade continuing to make headline in february  the receiver ha posted a few tweet that appear to show his frustration with the rumbling <BRK>they don t even kno what they did  the shift  transformation  is comin    thank u for motivating me yet again <BRK>one day  everything will all make sense in the end  i promise u  story s unfolding  it s all a part of the journey   justwait<BRK>a comment on instagram wa even more pointed <BRK>    frrr giant medium putting their best player in trade scenario cause they refuse to let go of their worst player     obj pic twitter com i exe ko a<BRK>but the trade rumor are   at least to some degree   a self inflicted wound for beckham  a year ago  they popped up right around the time a video made the internet round that showed the receiver with an aspiring french model  a pizza  and a couple of thing that resembled illegal substance <BRK> i guess my response to that is i m tired of answering question about odell s behavior   mara told reporter in march     he know what s expected of him  and now it s up to him  <BRK>beckham ha never been arrested and his only suspension wa a one game ban following a knock down  drag out battle with josh norman in    while his colorful and larger than life persona ha been a pain in the as for the giant at time  it han t kept him out of action <BRK>but the giant wanted to see personal growth before they committed long term to the receiver <BRK> the only question wa  wa it going to be this year  or were we going to give him another year to prove himself   mara said in august after beckham wa extended   but a i said  he came in with the right attitude  his energy level ha been off the roof  he s done everything we ve aked him to do <BRK> i think he s matured quite a bit    i think he s ready to go on and be the type of player and citizen that we expect him to be  and i think he will be  <BRK>then came the interview with lil wayne  beckham questioned manning s ability  and suggested the giant were holding the receiver back <BRK> i don t feel like i m being given the opportunity to be the very best that i can  to bring that every single day   and that s really all i want to do  to bring that every single day   beckham said   since i ve been here i ve put up number  record have been broken and all those good thing  not to say mean nothing to me  but i know they could have been double  or triple whatever they are now  that s the part that bother me  <BRK>the reaction wa swift <BRK>pat shurmur wa  livid  with odell beckham after the first part of his interview came out on friday  according to fox s  jayglazer   and made beckham apologize to the team      shurmur s public reaction did not indicate any anger at all  wonder if that ll change post game today <BRK>on top of the ill advised interview    wa another injury shortened season for beckham  a fractured ankle cost him   game in    and a quad injury kept him out for the last four game of the year in   <BRK>five season into his career  he s missed   game due to injury and one because of a suspension <BRK>that combination of drama and unavailability make the idea of cashing in a talented headache for draft capital and cap space intriguing <BRK>a day after glazer predicted a trade will happen this offseason  odds were released that showed the giant are still the likeliest team to have beckham on the roster in     although it wasn t very lopsided <BRK>odds for what team  obj will be on for week   of the   nfl regular season  betonline  giant   er   raider   dolphin   steeler   cardinal   jet   patriot   bill   cowboy   brown   bear    http   t co  hwgesfjv <BRK>then at the nfl combine  gettleman reiterated his same talking point from earlier in the offseason <BRK>gentleman   we didn t sign odell to trade him  that s all i need to say about that  <BRK>the biggest obstacle for a trade getting done are <BRK>the receiver is due to count    million against the giant  salary cap in    but they would only save    million of that space by trading him this spring  if the giant wait until after june   to trade beckham  the team could recoup    million of that cap space and carry only    million in dead money  but that d mean missing out on trading beckham for   draft pick and the big saving wouldn t be that useful month after free agency <BRK>bottom line  if the giant decide to trade beckham for a pick  or pick  in the   nfl draft  the team is going to carry    million in dead money in   and    million in    that s a whole lot of money going to a player who isn t even on the roster <BRK>can the giant even get enough for beckham to make that much dead money worthwhile  a year ago  brandin cook wa traded for a first round pick  presumably setting the price tag for beckham   an even more productive receiver   higher than that  <BRK>antonio brown is currently on the trading block and a player at beckham s level  but it d be surprising if the steelers got anything more than a second round pick for the   year old  pricy receiver <BRK>a team would probably need to come with a significant trade package to pry beckham from the giant  given his contract  his injury history  and a persona that may scare away a team or two   you probably shouldn t count on a trade getting done <BRK>
