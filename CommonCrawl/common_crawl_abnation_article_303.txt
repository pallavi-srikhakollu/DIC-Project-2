the knicks have stunk this season  it s leaving a bad taste in the mouth of head coach david fizdale  but the last thing he want you to suggesting is flossing  forget talent  effort  and drive being the cause of the knicks  woe  fitzdale is blaming it on fortnite  <BRK>it s been a common refrain from fizdale this seaon  who s blamed the game twice in a many month for the team s issue  now it s his biggest source of trouble   an observation that s being contested in the knicks  locker room  <BRK>  fortnite   that s my competitor right now   fizdale said in december    fortnite  is tougher than the boston celtic  <BRK>fizdale belief his player are staying up until the early hour of the morning to play fortnite  sacrificing their sleep to the game  he say he s noticed player being more irritable  reducing their reaction time  and blamed blue light  which come from screen  a being a core reaon for their lack of productivity <BRK>numerous study support the idea that blue light interferes with sleep and the body s regular metabolic function  but it s unclear if that would be enough to do something like  say  cause the knicks to lose   of their   game this season  <BRK>rookie mitchell robinson and forward kevin knox confess there were time they did get addicted to the game  since curbing their fortnite habit  robinson in particular ha noted a positive change to his energy since limiting how much he play <BRK> i kind of limit my time now  after i read that   he said   it kind of make sense  my energy level is better than it usually wa  <BRK>not everyone is cutting fortnite out of their life  however  mario hezonja disagreed that the game wa causing issue for the team <BRK> if you can control yourself  there s no problem for you   he said   but if you are reckless with it  you don t think about it  video game  partying  going out  all that other stuff you re going to end up in trouble regardless  i understand what fiz is saying  it might be a problem  but i don t think anyone over here is going crazy about it  we play for fun  i play for stress relief  for me it s a fun way to get away from thing  i don t think anyone else is   a m  staying up  <BRK>there is  of course  a positive to player choosing to spend their free time playing game  fizdale noted that despite his concern with fortnite hurting his team  he did see the benefit in his player choosing to stay in  rather than going out and partying   especially on road trip <BRK> i feel like it s definitely a different generation from that standpoint   he said   i don t feel like this generation is just running out when you get on the road to go party  at leat my team isn t  it s not the same a it used to be  <BRK>this might feel like an  old man yell at cloud  moment  but fizdale doesn t hate the game  the   year old is even open to trying to play fornite for the first time  <BRK> i m gonna have to get it on   fizdale said   i ll probably just to be able to connect to them  just to be able to do it  i ll get mitchell to teach me  he can yell at me on that  that ll be his time to yell  he can be my coach  <BRK>who know  maybe fizdale will get addicted too <BRK>
