it s the afc championship game  it s being played in at arrowhead stadium in kansa city  it s the goliath of the nfl for the past two decade coming into the home of the cheeeeifs with a trip to atlanta   the super bowl   on the line  <BRK> when these two team played in week    the chief offense didn t have a difficult time moving the ball against the patriot  even though the chief offense started slowly  it wa more about patrick mahomes missing a couple of throw   throw he normally hit   rather than a patriot defense locking down the chief  <BRK> a the game progressed   and mahomes settled in   the chief offense looked a unstoppable against the patriot a it ha against any other team  the patriot were able to find success with situational football and a few unique look  but the game wa still an offensive showdown   <BRK> let s get on down to the ap laboratory and break down how the chief can repeat that success   and improve upon it   <BRK> personnel and scheme <BRK> the full advanced scouting report on the patriot from the first matchup ha a deeper breakdown of the patriot  personnel usage and scheme  <BRK> but there have been a few big change since then  <BRK> a a whole  the patriot secondary ha been playing much better since week    stephon gilmore is playing a well a he ever ha  j c  jackson ha emerged a a solid young cornerback  and jaon mccourty ha been playing better down the stretch  having three cornerback with different skill set ha allowed the patriot to match up man to man against nearly every team   and that s what the chief should expect to see in this game   <BRK> chief  wrs are going to be presented with plenty of   on   opportunity with db playing man coverage  more than kelce and hill will have to win these matchup a ne will focus on taking them away  this is just  my guy can lock you up  defense here and exactly that happens pic twitter com wziteugm  <BRK> identify the help coverage <BRK> the patriot  preferred man coverage is cover    which usually ha two free defender playing in a deep zone and an underneath zone in the middle of the field  where the patriot differ than most team is how they treat those two free defender in their assignment  they will gladly bracket  or shade  one or both of these free defender towards the opposing team  top target s   <BRK> the patriot run more man coverage than any other team in the nfl  and often do so with a single high safety  cover     where they get unique is in how they use their  free  defender   or    rather than playing mof spot zone  they ll often slide to bracket or read thru the slot pic twitter com gdqeskfwbb <BRK> this allows the patriot to play a more stingy coverage and also limit the big play potential from the opposing team s top target  <BRK> an inside bracket to a wide receiver to either side of the formation move both free defender away from the normal location of these two player in cover    the chief can t expect there to be a single high safety playing in the middle of the field  or a single underneath curl defender playing in the middle of the field   these guy will be moving all over the place   <BRK> a good way to attack ne s man heavy approach is with deep crossing  over  and post corner  with how they use their free defender to bracket specific player rather than staying  home  a a priority  guy will come open kc had a fair amount success on deep over route  st time pic twitter com twtqa y bu <BRK> here we see a similar concept   both the underneath defender and deep free defender are looking to bracket keenan allen   the near wide receiver   the far wide receiver run a matching crossing route   but without either defender playing in the traditional spot zone    so there is no help for the corner a the receiver cross the field   <BRK> man beating route concept <BRK> something that wa extremely noticeable from the game between the los angeles charger and the patriot wa a lack of route concept designed to take advantage of the patriot  man coverage  there were a lot of vertical shot  but not nearly the amount of horizontal route concept you would expect against a heavy man to man team   and almost no mesh concept  or shallow to intermediate crossing concept   <BRK> downside to the  psycho   amoeba front is it put guy out of position and add a ton of traffic  reid won t go full lac and throw nonstop vertical against the man  they will run mesh and pick route all day  again   ne likely adjusts to bump the shallow cross  but  hill  on  pic twitter com riv ced dx <BRK> in week    the chief found success with running various mesh concept with both travis kelce and sammy watkins  this pulled multiple defender into the middle of the field and forced them to work around one another  the chief can make high low read out of these crossing concept   or do what they did on this play  specifically design a play for one player to come open  notice how kelce slows down and just kind of drift into the cornerback s path  rather than running an actual route   <BRK> after they look at the film  the patriot will likely try to chip some of these shallow crossing route   but when a team show this kind of front with all the player standing near the box  there is an opening downfield  if the patriot want to dedicate a player to hitting a shallow crosser  that will leave someone else in one on one coverage downfield   <BRK> an answer to the cover   blitz <BRK> the area where the patriot defense gave the chief offense the most difficulty in week   wa when they rotated down into a cover   look and blitzed out of it  the patriot would stack the interior of the offensive line with linebacker and defensive back  and push their defensive end out very wide  the confusion caused by all these standing player   not knowing who wa blitzing and who wa dropping   created problem for mahomes and the pas protection call  <BRK> patriot have unique blitz package w  complicated part showing   rusher read the protection slide    player pressuring same olineman s gap if covered by an ol s slide  pop out into shallow zoneensures rusher aren t just running into a block   put number in  hot  area pic twitter com wkwlzcqp r <BRK> what make it so special for the patriot is how they deploy their blitzing player  rather than asigning guy a gap to blitz in   or simply tagging them a a rusher   they turn it into a read and react type of play  <BRK> here  there are six defender pressuring six potential gap with only five blocker to handle them  the basic rule for an offense is to slide the protection and allow the quarterback to beat one free rusher  <BRK> the problem come when the patriot second level player all begin to rush  then pop out into shallow zone  there is still a free rusher putting the pressure on mahomes  but now they are only bringing three guy after the quarterback  the three other player showing   and even beginning   their blitz are dropping back into what would normally be the hot zone against this kind of blitz   <BRK> biggest o series of the game     misdirection screen that devey couldn t get to the lb in time    yard      quick hitch to watkins    yard     ne showing this   man pressure only to rush   after reading the ol protection again chief need answer v this c   blitz package pic twitter com bzhvqjzyde <BRK> what the patriot are doing here is having their blitzers read the pas protection slide  if an offensive linemen flash towards them   or open their hip or chest to square up   they are stopping and popping back out into a shallow zone  it s still resulting in a free rusher that the offense know about  but the defender dropping back are causing hesitation and confusion over when  and where  a receiver will be coming open   <BRK> solution  the first   and obvious   answer is to bring in an extra blocker such a a tight end or running back  when the chief used a running back to help with this protection  the patriot had the defender dedicated to the running back blitz  this presented the same dilemma because the first defender through could occupy the running back  which still provides a free path to the quarterback   <BRK> the second option is using a tight end a an extra blocker   the chief didn t face this cover   look and counter it with a tight end staying in to block  the patriot would likely use the same general rule against a tight end a they would against a running back in pas protection   however  it s eaier for a tight end to chip or block   and then slip out into a flat   than it is for a running back   <BRK> rather than adding more player to the protection   and therefore the pas rush   the chief should aim to fix the protection call itself  rather than just adding more body   <BRK> the top diagram is a combination pas set  something widely used in air raid offense  <BRK> the play side is to the left  and both play side offensive linemen are blocking the man in front of them  if the second rusher from the outside is backing out  initially the guard is still dropping vertically and should be in position to help with the a gap to his side  <BRK> the back side linemen are all setting vertically  rather than looking to engage rusher near the line of scrimmage  they are dropping about three yard almost straight back  playing patiently and forcing the new england rusher to commit one way or another  if all six player end up rushing  the free rusher is still the outside most player off the back side  mahomes just ha to know that s where the free rusher will be   and with the depth of the vertical set by the offensive line  this should buy an extra tenth of a second to get the ball out  <BRK> the bottom diagram is simply moving the pocket on a sprint out concept  normally  limiting the field to only one side isn t the best move  but when a team is playing cover   it s completely man on man with no help anywhere  <BRK> for this to work  there ha to be belief in your player to win   buying mahomes a few extra second by moving the pocket and leaving the free rusher to run across the entire field should accomplish that  the trick is having the offensive tackle either block down or step up aggressively  giving the offensive guard enough space to quickly get outside and handle the edge rusher  the easiest way to ensure that is have  the slot wide receiver chip the defensive end   <BRK> beyond adjusting the pa protection scheme  the chief could also simply throw quick screen and bubble outside the number  a all the interior player are occupied reading the pa protection  there will be no immediate pursuit  and the chief would be a single missed tackle  or bad angle  away from a huge play  <BRK> if the pa protection isn t being adjusted  the quick paing game is the answer  but a we have seen  if the chief opt to adjust their pa protection to buy them just another half a second  there will be guy uncovering deep   a seen in the above play   <BRK> i don t mean to stiff the run game in back to back week  but in the modern nfl  the most creative and important matchup appear in the passing game   especially for the chief  that being said  there is one brief detail that could benefit the chief based on the patriot  tendency to beat up and chip travis kelce   <BRK> the pat used their edge player to chip travis kelce off of the los often in the first matchup but that leaf favorable number for the o on run play  especially with even the possibility of a rpo  chipping kelce   a player on him in man take   player out of the pursuit pic twitter com apt prhy k <BRK> a kelce motion across  the defensive end shift out over him to chip him on his releae  the safety taked with covering kelce also ha to respect him just in cae this isn t a pure run  but rather an rpo  two defender are taken completely out of this run  and they don t have to be sealed or blocked off from the play  this give the chief plus number in the run game   if it wan t for a missed chop by mitch morse   and eric fisher waiting to seal a slow pursuing player rather than attacking a safety   this could have been an even bigger gain   <BRK> the chief offense and patriot defense both did thing to stress each other throughout the week   game  in multiple instance  both team were merely inch away from having even more success than they did  <BRK> week   wa a rare matchup in which two team schemed up   and successfully executed   much of their game plan at a high level  the rematch should be more of the same  <BRK> whichever team make the small adjustment to counter the incoming adjustment by their opponent will be the team that move on to atlanta   <BRK>
