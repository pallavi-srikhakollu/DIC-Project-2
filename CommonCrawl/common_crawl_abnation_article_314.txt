wall at the same time  creating an instant stalemate  after a moment  cole gained ground and started puhing derik back  derik faced the edge of his side and the end of this competition  he wa within  we d say  six inch of getting puhed off when something in him jut clicked on  derik managed to jolt cole slightly off balance and would not let up on the pressure  the wall swung back through the middle  putting cole on the defense  but cole lost all traction and actually fell to his knee  facing away from the door  with his ankle trapped under the bar  it left him in a hopeless position and
