early lat march  the miami dolphin decided to releae ndamukong suh in what wa characterized a an effort to effect  culture change  on the team in teal in south florida  dante fowler  who wa the third overall pick in the   draft  wa traded away by the jacksonville jaguar in late october in the middle of his fourth seaon in the league  it wa pretty clear at that point that the jaguar had given fowler all of the opportunity they were willing to give him  and that they were finally ready to move on  <BRK> both of those guy were deemed expendable by their former team for different reason  but with their respective ability  the los angeles ram saw two player who could have a major impact on their defense   <BRK> when they picked up suh in free agency  there wa a lot of chatter about him being  done   when they traded for fowler this past fall  quite a few people doubted whether they could get any more out of him than the jaguar had over his first three and a half season  i think it s clear after their performance against the saint in the nfc championship game that to the extent that bringing in either guy wa a  gamble   the ram seem to have hit the jackpot  <BRK> on sunday against the saint  fowler and suh teamed up with reigning  and soon to be two time  defensive player of the year aaron donald to make life a living hell for drew brees and the new orleans offense  all three of them had outstanding individual play throughout the game  but some of their most impressive work came when they played off each other to create big play  <BRK> i actually started off trying to pick one of them a my ho this week  but after watching the film several time  i finally came to the conclusion that all three of them deserved it  i simply could not choose just one guy because they all played so well  so instead  i m naming all three of them a my hoes of the week  i m also going to focus on three play where they worked together to force lost yardage play on the saint  rather than focus on their individual big play   <BRK> no matter what you think of the end of that game  and trust me  i have some thought  too   if these three cat hadn t balled out all day  the ram would ve never even had a chance to win in the first place  <BRK> the way the game started off certainly did not favor los angeles  especially playing in new orleans  the ram found themselves already down     at the beginning of the second quarter after surrendering a touchdown and two field goal  and they were in real danger of the game getting out of hand  after finally getting on the board with a field goal on the first drive of that quarter  it wa the defense s turn to show up and make some play if they wanted to try to claw back into the game  <BRK> with a little le than   minute to go in the second quarter  new orleans had a first and   at it own   yard line  on this particular play  donald wa lined up a the left three technique on the outside edge of saint right guard larry warford  fowler wa lined up on the same side outside of him a the left edge rusher opposite saint right tackle ryan ramczyk  brees wa in the shotgun with alvin kamara off set to his left  and it appeared the saint wanted to try to run kamara on a belly play to the right  the problem with that plan wa that it required warford to try to zone block on donald all by himself  <BRK> on the snap  warford came off hard at donald s outside shoulder to try to gain outside leverage on him  donald recognized the reach block right away  and instead of trying to fight it  he simply did a swim move inside to avoid warford and backdoor the play  now  normally a guy coming inside like that when he is about to be reach blocked would create an immediate running lane outside for the running back   <BRK> donald  however  is anything but normal  <BRK> a a matter of fact  that swim move wan t all that simple  either  donald did something that i only noticed once i watched in slow mo  he actually changed direction in mid air  seriously  <BRK> on my initial watching  i just kind of assumed that donald took a step upfield  planted his foot in the ground  then stepped inside with his swim move  but i wa wrong  i will try to explain what actually happened  but i m pretty sure i won t do it justice  <BRK> donald had his right hand down and his right foot back in his stance  which meant his first step would be with his right foot  but he would be using his left leg to spring himself forward on his get off  when the ball wa snapped  donald did indeed step with his right foot  but he noticed warford s reach block while his right foot wa still in the air  his left foot  however  wa still on the ground at that point  and somehow   i m still not sure exactly how   donald s body wa able to react so fast that he went from using his left leg to propel him straight forward  to having that same left leg push him just a hair inside before his right foot hit the ground  and that is what helped him to slide inside in mid air and slip by warford with a swim move  <BRK> did you get all that  <BRK>  you really should watch it again in slo mo if you can   <BRK> the swim move itself wa also top notch a  even in mid air  donald wa able to take his inside  right  hand and swipe warford s inside  left  hand out of the way  to ensure warford couldn t recover  donald finished the move by using his outside  left  arm to pin warford s inside arm behind him  donald continued right on his merry way into the backfield  almost totally unimpeded by warford s block  but he couldn t quite take down the slippery kamara behind the line of scrimmage  <BRK> no matter  however  since he chaed him right into the waiting arm of fowler  who had done a good job of holding his ground and keeping his outside leverage on ramczyk s bae block attempt  with donald having done most of the work  all fowler had to do wa stand there and wait for kamara to come right to his waiting arm  it went in the book a a   yard tackle for a loss for fowler  but donald definitely deserves an asist for that play  <BRK> the ram would go on to force their first three and out of the game on that drive  <BRK> with just under three minute left in the first half  the ram forced the saint into a second and   situation from their own   yard line  suh had beaten saint left guard andrus peat like a drum from his nose tackle position and sacked brees on first down for a loss of   yard  on second down  suh went from being aligned a the nose tackle to actually being kicked out a the right defensive end opposite saint left tackle terron armstead  donald wa inside of him a the three tech  while fowler wa once again lined up a the left edge rusher opposite ramczyk  <BRK> the speedy fowler came screaming off the ball at the snap like he wa shot out of a cannon  ramczyk took a decent pa set  but a the saying go  speed kill  fowler took a subtle step wide initially that forced ramczyk to step wider than usual to try to come out and get him  then with ramczyk quickly approaching  fowler dipped low and came through with a big time rip move with his inside  right  arm   <BRK> ramczyk wa pretty much toast after fowler got underneath him with that rip move  but he tried to ride fowler on by the level of the quarterback  however  fowler wa simply too fast and too low to the ground  and he wa still able to cut the corner tight enough to force brees to step up into the pocket  <BRK> meanwhile  on the other side of the line  suh wa momentarily caught up in all the extra attention that team show donald every game  first  saint tight end dan arnold came off the ball and tried to chip him  although it appeared that arnold may have taken the worst of that collision  he wa able to force suh inside a little and right down the middle of armstead  suh then appeared to try to toss armstead outside and come inside  but he ended up bumping into peat  who wa double teaming donald with the center  max unger   <BRK> eventually  however  peat had to go back to trying to block donald  and it wa at that same point that brees wa trying to step up in the pocket to avoid fowler s speed rush  <BRK> with fowler still in hot pursuit  suh managed to cross unger s face to get over and block brees  escape route up the middle  the other defensive tackle  michael brockers  just about got in on the sack  but he ended up sliding off of brees  fowler and suh then converged on brees and took him down for the sack  <BRK> it only ended up being a   yard loss  but that sack helped to keep new orleans off schedule  after gaining only   yard on a screen to kamara on third and    the saint were once again forced to punt  <BRK> the ram offense would score their first touchdown of the game on the ensuing drive to pull within three point at halftime  <BRK> ok  so i know the no call near the end of regulation on the pas interference helmet to helmet hit on the ram wa really  really bad  but that doesn t change the fact that the ram defense  and specifically this trio  made play to win in overtime  i saw a lot of people complaining about overtime rule after the chief patriot game because the kansa city offense and it fantastic second year quarterback  patrick mahomes  never got a chance in overtime   <BRK> well  the saint got the ball first in overtime in their game  and it didn t work out so well for them  did it  <BRK> fowler had the big pressure in ot to force brees into an interception  but the play before that one wa pretty impressive by that ram defensive line  too  the saint had the ball at their own   yard line after a   yard pas interference penalty  and with a couple more first down they would ve been pretty close to field goal range  <BRK> now  one understated problem the saint had at that point wa that they were almost running out of tight end  their stater  ben watson  missed the game completely with an injury  and backup josh hill got hurt in the first quarter  that left arnold and garrett griffin a the lat tight end standing in overtime  <BRK> you might be asking yourself why you should care about some tight end you have never heard of  well  it s because one of them  griffin  wa asked to block suh one on one on a running play on that first down in overtime  <BRK> fucking mistake  <BRK> the saint came out with griffin and a wide receiver to the offensive left side of the formation  with two receiver on the opposite side  brees wa in shotgun with mark ingram offset to his left  and new orleans wa going to try to run a zone play to the right with ingram  normally a zone run play like that would have a natural cutback lane behind the tight end s block backside  because the defensive end to that side is usually in a  damned if you do  damned if you don t  situation  <BRK> if the defensive end drive down hard inside to try to stay in their c gap  they usually have to go so flat down the line that it allows the running back to cutback down hill all the way outside of them  <BRK> if they try to muscle up the tight end instead and push them into the backfield  they usually give up that c gap and the running back can cutback downhill in that hole with a fully head of steam  <BRK> of course  normally that defensive end isn t ndamukong suh  and normally that tight end wouldn t have been griffin either  for that matter  <BRK> to say suh dominated griffin on that play just doesn t come close to doing it justice  for about half a second after they made contact  it almost appears that griffin might be able to hold his own  and then reality hit  <BRK> or should i say  suh did  <BRK> suh got control of griffin and mushed him back like he wa a toddler  then tossed him aide like some cold mcdonald s french fry right into the c gap so that ingram couldn t try to cut back in that gap  with griffin s body blocking his path  ingram wa pretty much forced to try to cut it all the way back to the d gap  and  unfortunately for ingram  that meant cutting back meant running right at suh  he might a well have tried to run over a brick wall  suh wrapped ingram up and immediately two yard behind the line of scrimmage  <BRK> but  the play wasn t over  <BRK> suh  ever aware of his reputation a a dirty player and wary of getting a dumb penalty in that situation  just tried to sling ingram backward instead of his normal regular seaon chokeslam him into the turf  well  ingram wa able to keep his balance and stay upright  and the official allowed the play to go on  <BRK> that actually didn t turn out to be a good thing for ingram  or the saint  however  <BRK> see  donald  who wa lined up inside of suh a the right three tech  had done a great job of playing the scoop block by peat and armstead on that play  he wa able to anchor down against peat and once armstead came off the block to go up to the second level  donald wa able to expand back outside and to where ingram had cut back  no sooner than ingram gathered himself after suh tried to throw him to the ground  donald wa right there on his as to keep him from gaining any more yard   <BRK> out of instinct  ingram tried to continue to run and make something out of nothing on that play  but he actually ended up losing more yard than he would have initially when it wa all said and done  instead of a   yard loss  donald ended up taking him down for a   yard loss  and pretty much forced the saint to throw on the next play  <BRK> and we all know how that turned out  <BRK> feel however you want about how that game ended  and i totally get that  the one thing you can t deny is that fowler  suh  and donald were kicking as for most of that game  from the first play to the last on defense  all three were outstanding individually  and collectively they were even better   <BRK> now they head to the super bowl to face the patriot and tom brady  who many people believe to be the greatest quarterback ever  i think of how sweet it must be for fowler and suh after their former team gave up on them  i don t know that they will win the super bowl to get the ultimate revenge  but after the big hand they had in getting the ram there  it is my pleaure to award dante fowler  ndamukong suh  and the all world aaron donald  a my ho of the week for the conference championship round of the playoff  <BRK>
