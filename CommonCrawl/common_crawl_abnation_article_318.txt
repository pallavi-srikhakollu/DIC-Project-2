   <BRK> irving later walked those comment back a bit in boston s following team practice  saying that fire came from a burning desire to win  he did not play against brooklyn on monday night  <BRK>  when you win  you want to taste it again  i never want to come from a place where i don t want to sound like or maybe feel like i don t want to win a championship   he said  via nesn   sometimes i may come off and say thing  never to question my teammate in public like that ever again  but i just want to win so bad   <BRK> ha this season changed irving s mind about staying  or boston s mind about wanting to keep him  we ll see  but it s fair to ask the question   <BRK> irving s looming decision will be the talk of multiple town until he finally sign a contract  he can sign for five year and about    million in boston   or even more if he make the all nba team  the most he can sign for elsewhere is four year       million  <BRK> the clipper  laker  knicks  net  king   er  sun  bull  hawk  and maverick will have enough space to make a run at any max player next summer   <BRK>
