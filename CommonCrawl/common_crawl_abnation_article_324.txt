   <BRK> rourke is a mobile quarterback s mobile quarterback  he s elusive  tough  throw a lot of play action bomb  seems to throw better under pressure than in a clean pocket  and  well  probably take too many sack  <BRK> solich and longtime coordinator tim albin have crafted an exciting evolution of the old i formation triple option  spreading thing out and changing the  option  in the option  and the        pound rourke is the perfect quarterback to run it  <BRK> a he head into his senior seaon  the name around him have changed dramatically  ouellette and iron are gone  a are white and meyer  the bobcat  two deep will boat zero back who rushed at leat   time lat year and only two wideouts who caught more than three pases  oh yeah  and the bobcat have to replace three all conference linemen  too  yikes  <BRK> this is why  despite rourke s return  s p  project ohio a only the mac s fourth best team   well  that  and the iffy defense   but his supporting cat still appears to have upside  he s still got odom and isiah cox  for starter  <BRK> odom wa a little more all or nothing than white or meyer  but he averaged a decent     yard per target  and cox made the most of his opportunity a a freshman  catching   of   ball for   yard      per catch   and three score  he caught three ball for   yard and a score against niu  almost allowing the bobcat to overcome both a poor rushing day and horrible turnover luck  <BRK> another freshman  tiny jerome buckner           caught just three ball all season while redshirting  but they went for   and   yard against virginia and   yard against buffalo  he could make some noise in white s abandoned slot position  plus  solich ha been stocking up on three star tight end   he s got three of them in the freshman class  including     tyler foster  one of his most regarded signees  te haven t been used all that much in athens  that might change  <BRK> there are fewer knowns in the backfield  ouellette and iron were long term contributor  and the leading returning rusher are now sophomore jake neatherton    carry    yard   redshirt freshman o shaan allison  seven for     and junior julian ross  seven for     if they re ready  a couple of   signees could find rotation time  juco transfer de montre tuggle and wonderfully named three star freshman walter wilbon iii  <BRK> despite the loss of three all mac linemen   tackle joe lowery and guard joe anderson and durrell wood   ohio is not without experience up front  four returning upperclassmen have combined for   start  and three other junior and senior filled spot on the two deep in    they re big  too  averaging        among these seven player  that s a decent base  and it doesn t count three star juco gary hoover  listed at          <BRK> rourke will run his way into and out of trouble  but he ll probably get a competent performance from his line  <BRK> a daily ish mini column on the college football thing of the day  with some other stuff too  <BRK> considering turnover  it wa easy to worry that the ohio defense would hold the offense back in    and sure enough  jimmy burrow s final bobcat defense wa even worse than imaginable for half the season  seven week in  ohio wa  th in def  s p   they had never finished worse than  th in solich s tenure  <BRK> burrow  father of joe  retired in february  but not before some last minute improvement  <BRK> croutch recorded     of his   tfls in the last four game  and the secondary thrived when it started getting extra pas rush support  <BRK> considering the secondary wa loaded with sophomore  and considering the by committee approach on the line included player like freshman amos ogun semore and sophomore will evans and austin conrad  it s easy to find yourself optimistic about  say  the   ohio defense  <BRK> in longtime lb coach ron collins  first seaon a coordinator  however  he ll have a new batch of turnover  croutch and tackle kent berger and andrew payne were among the reaons for ohio s late year improvement  and they re gone  while the bobcat will almost certainly improve on lat year s year end no    ranking  they might have to settle for something in the  s or  s  <BRK> of course  pro football focus really liked evans and safety javon hagan  ohio ha a much depth at end a any team in the mac  and with junior marlin brook  ilyaa motley  and jamal hudson  they might have better depth at cornerback  too  in junior safety jarren hampton the bobcat have a player with more disruptive potential than the one guy they lost in the secondary  kylan nelson   <BRK> there s potential for a sustained bounce back  in other word  but it will likely depend on competence from the tackle and wlb position  croutch wa far more disruptive than any other linebacker  and tackle cole baker  brian arp  and kaieem caesar will need to raise their respective game  ohio could be awesome on the edge  but that won t matter if they re too soft on the interior  <BRK> long a strength for solich and coordinator brian haines  ohio ha ranked in the special team s p  top   five time this decade and in the top   on two other occasion  <BRK> after three straight top   finish  the bobcat slipped to  th last year  thanks primarily to some glitch from place kicker louie zervos  but ohio wa still well rounded  zervos is still solid  michael farkas is a booming punter      average last year   th in punt efficiency   and in bryan long jr  and julian ross  ohio still present danger in the return game despite the loss of papi white and kylan nelson  <BRK> over half the team in the mac enter   thinking they have a shot at a conference title run  the field is more crowded than last year  when  for the second straight season  ohio managed to both play like the best team in the east and and lose the one game it couldn t  <BRK> for that reaon  it s hard to be a confident in the bobcat  title chance this time  and that s before you get to the turnover in the skill corp and trench  still  they re very much in the race  still at leat a narrow eat favorite   <BRK> solich is coaching better in his  s than he did in his  s  and it would be pretty incredible if he could finally reel in the elusive conference title before he retires  that might be easier with rourke than without  <BRK> tossup game will tell the story  s p  project ohio a a multi score favorite in five game  including four conference game  and a multi score underdog in only one  that leaf six game projected within one touchdown  the bobcat are at leat slightly favored in all eight mac game  and they can probably afford to drop a tossup  maybe two  along the way  but they ll need to get rolling a little earlier in the year this time around  <BRK> all   preview data to date  <BRK>
