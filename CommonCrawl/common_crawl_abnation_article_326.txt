williamson s mixtapes have the power to take the internet by storm  more than that  they show how mixtapes have evolved into a grand tradition and art form all their own   <BRK> before the internet became their go to medium  streetball highlight were hard to find  before the  s  studio such a  th century fox put out vhs tape that featured nba star  and espn covered baketball during sportscenter a it doe today  but footage largely focused on nba and college player  then the and  mixtape tour began and took some of the spotlight off of the nba and put it on the pure creativity inherent in the game  all while injecting a hip hop vibe   <BRK> in    in order to promote it shoe and clothing brand  and  began releaing mixtape that featured famous streetballers such a philip champion  also known a hot sauce  and waliyy dixon  a k a  main event  the mixtape gained a wider reputation when and  began hosting a competition in which streetballers traveled to town across the united state to challenge local talent  footage from these game  along with clip from outside the tour  were compiled into the mixtape and sold a vhs tape to the public  with the lat volume coming out in     <BRK> the footage wa one of a kind  the and  mixtapes gave basketball a fresh  on the ground feel that also brought new face to television  they showed flashy one on one play that often ended with alley oops and other acrobatic finish  the video also featured hip hop music in the background  alongside the clip of dazzling offensive maneuver  <BRK> the and  tour quickly became one of the hottest basketball product of the  s  the segment were regularly shown on espn under the term  streetball   and the tour went international  further increasing it fame  the player were also featured frequently on hoopstv com  one of the first site to showcase playground basketball before the site shut down in    the tour and it mixtapes even inspired a video game called and  streetball for playstation   and xbox  <BRK> among the most famous player from the and  mixtapes are the professor and former nba player rafer alston  also known by his streetball name skip   my lou  by the end of    more than     copy of the and  mixtape vol     a collection that heavily featured alston  were sold  though alston  who enjoyed a long professional basketball career  probably did not need mixtapes to become a household name  the professor showed how highlight video could boost an amateur player s reputation  through the and  mixtapes  the professor quickly became a streetball legend  and the popularity he gained because of the tour is evident today  he currently ha more than     million subscriber on youtube  <BRK>   the and  tour  seemed to be the most influential merger of hip hop and basketball   boucher say   it also captured the crowd with streetball style highlight  it wa the first time we had seen that and got a feel for that  when you watch it  it just put you in a good mood   <BRK> though the and  mixtapes were popular  the tour did not have the advantage of today s robust social medium environment  it missed the boom of platform such a youtube that would have given it even more exposure  it influence  however  continues to be felt  partially inspired by the and  mixtapes  baketball brand such a hoopmixtape and ballislife started compiling video of their own a few year after and  s releaes   <BRK>  and  wa the forefront of hoopstv com   boucher say   they were actually very innovative in all of their marketing  and they were on top of digital  but i don t think youtube and all that stuff really took off a a big business and became mainstream until at leat after   or    so it just missed the wave   <BRK> in    ballislife posted one of it first ever video  showing an  th grade derrick rose emphatically dunking over a defender  the clip garnered     view in a few hour  propelling rose s popularity with the capture of one spectacular dunk  rose s play became an early example of how a young player could become an overnight sensation   <BRK> according to nil wagner  who worked for ballislife before going on to co found hoopmixtape  the video wa so popular it quickly crashed the ballislife website  the hype from the video inspired wagner and other pioneer at ballislife and hoopmixtape to put some and  style shine on high school player         <BRK> high school basketball mixtapes were commonly produced in the late  s and early  s  however  the number of production company grew quickly in the mid  s along with interest in recruiting  within the past five year  production company evolved again by putting out longer video of in game footage that show a whole game s worth of key play without background music  saving them time from meticulously editing mixtape video and allowing them to get highlight out before their competitor  <BRK>  when  ballislife  first started  it wa going around all summer and all high school season and collecting all this footage to cram it into a three or four minute video   say tyler tubridy  founder and videographer of basketball website hoopdiamonds   it wa a really awesome three or four minute video  but it s a lot of time  energy  and footage that get put into one video    <BRK> while flahy video such a mixtapes show only the best baketball scene from a player s seaon or career without context  raw in game footage made it much clearer what a single player s impact wa  for those player who wanted to get noticed solely for their baketball  the game focused video were often preferred   <BRK> still  the tried and true highlight mixtape is hard to beat in term of it ability to go viral  fortunately  company today try to put out a mix of content so that fan don t have to choose between entertaining and more practical option to learn about up and coming amateur player   <BRK>  the viewership is interested in seeing  player  a full on baketball player  too   tubridy say   they may appreciate the mixtapes  the flah  the editing  and stuff like that because at the end of the day it s still an art form  but they also want to see how they are in a full game setting   <BRK> though high school basketball coverage can help player get noticed  critic of social medium worry about the insidious effect of exposing player to the world at such an early age  <BRK>  i think there s a lot of pressure on the player   ballislife co founder and president matt rodriguez say   especially if they have social medium account  they have to grow up really quickly and can t make a lot of mistake  these kid can t make a harmless mistake at all because if they do  they re under the lens  if they do something on a video  everyone will see   <BRK> though the pressure is there  many high school player have proven they can thrive under the intense scrutiny  williamson gained national fame while in high school after footage of his flashy dunk went viral  with the medium s eye focused on him  williamson dominated his competition and earned scholarship offer to several college basketball powerhouse before eventually choosing duke  <BRK> the large audience also doesn t seem to bother mizzou commit mario mckinney  the no    ranked high school player in missouri in the class of    according to   sport  <BRK>  i feel like i m doing well when everyone is watching me   mckinney say   i m just not going to take it for granted  i have people just surrounding me and being supportive of me  i receive a lot of criticism every day because people are just going to hate  it really doesn t do anything to me but just push me to go harder and make it   <BRK> because of the power of highlight video  high school player today can also be more proactive in the college recruiting process than their predecessor  for player who hail from school that do not receive vast medium coverage  the video provide them an opportunity to advertise their ability to the world  now  they often take the initiative to create and send professional looking video to ncaa scout in order to increase their chance of being seen   <BRK>  i don t think  video coverage  ha ever landed a kid a scholarship offer on the dot  but it might enter a name into a school or coach s head   tubridy say   then  coach  might go and check them out and come to find out that they really do like the player and pursue them a a recruit   <BRK> viral basketball video can even help open up career possibility for many individual who may never make it into the nba or wnba  or earn a spot on an ncaa team   <BRK> while playing a a sophomore in patterson high school in baltimore  aquille carr received a      contract offer from lottomatica rom  a professional italian team  the social medium fame that the     carr accumulated for his crafty play style helped earn him one of the biggest contract offer at the time by a european team to any player who had yet to graduate from high school   <BRK> social medium can even build relationship among player who are inspired by each other s game  a few year ago  university of minnesota guard isaiah wahington started the concept of the  jelly   a way to perform a layup in a fanciful fahion that includes holding the ball outward and kicking the leg out before putting the ball up with significant spin  the jelly became a movement known a  jelly fam  a many others began to

follower on instagram for his video that feature basketball trick shot  jass add his own twist on many shot  but the influence of jelly fam and and  is clear  many of his dribble move and layup could

 the player  don t live up to those expectation and all that hype   tubridy say   even if that s the cae  at leat they went ahead and were able to build up a following of fan who are interested in them a player and people  so if they don t end up going on to play college or don t play in the nba  they can then leverage that fan bae and following to whatever they want to do with their life   <BRK> boucher  for example  wa able to make a career out of creating stylized baketball content featuring dribble move  and in turn creating his own brand known a global hooper  the entertainment company dude perfect started off a a group of friend that became known for posting trick shot on youtube and owes much of it success to online exposure  semi professional player brandon armstrong
