  <BRK>here s the most poignant point from the nichol s sit down <BRK> a lot of people don t realize on the outside that a lot of thing that are said get into the locker room   a lot of thing that are put in headline get into locker room   medium ha broken up locker room <BRK>it s been done before where you say something and it s misinterpreted and instead of addressing it with the person and individual  like human interaction  you read it on your phone  you read it on a text <BRK>someone say to you   hey  did you see what this person said about you   and it s your teammate   you re like   i didn t hear that    you hold back  you don t say anything to them and then throughout the season  it end up coming out again <BRK>it s just not how life is supposed to go   it s a unique position  but i m appreciative that i can have this understanding now   it s fun  but at the same time  it s energy taxing  <BRK>that interview wa presumably recorded during the all star break  but during his press availability yesterday in milwaukee  speculation over his impending free agency took center stage again  this time under ridiculous circumstance <BRK>in charlotte  an unauthorized video wa taken of irving and kevin durant chatting in the bowel of the spectrum center before the all star game   it appeared to be a casual conversation between two good friend  but twitter lip reader  and knicks fan  speculated that the two superstar were discussing two max slot opening up in new york   from the time that durant won mvp to today  the video clip ha lit nba social medium on fire <BRK>when asked about it  kyrie wa understandably salty   it wa a perfect example of the irresponsible gotcha journalism that ha found an energy source from rumor  innuendo  and hearsay   here s the exchange between irving and the medium <BRK>here s the full exchange kyrie irving had with reporter about that video with kevin durant  pic twitter com divtwwmyed<BRK>for the sake of full context  here s the video <BRK>irving repeated his criticism of the caricature that nba social medium ha painted of the player and how it  ruin locker room    one part of me think that if it s all  fictitious  and pure speculation  it shouldn t bother the player   they know what really happens in their locker room so everything else is just noise   but i m also team kyrie   sport coverage ha become equal part tabloid and hot take and le about analysis and storytelling <BRK>what i ve liked about irving over the lat two year ha been his brutal honesty and frankly  his uncensored approach to the medium and lack of awareness with public relation   his declaration in october that he plan on re signing with the celtic in july seemed genuine   it felt like he wanted to break that news a soon a possible because he wa excited   the nike commercial he wrote about his father and retiring his number to the rafter may have been more polished statement of intention  but it came off sincere and from his heart   so  when he lahes out at reporter for distorting his word or taking thing out of context  it s hard not to take his side <BRK>the garden report reacts to kyrie <BRK>
