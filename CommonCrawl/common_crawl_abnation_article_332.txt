you know all about the chief <BRK>you know about their offense and it place atop the list of every major team metric   total offense  dvoa  expected point  etc  you know all about phenom patrick mahomes and his   touchdown      yard season  replete with a unique repertoire of no look pass and side armed seed  <BRK>you know about the mvp favorite s supporting cast of elite weapon like tyreek hill  travis kelce  and sammy watkins  you know about the star studded offensive line in front of him  and you know all about the cunning  imaginative scheme with which andy reid deploys this potent stable of personnel <BRK>what you may not know is  the patriot defense ha already unlocked the formula for slowing kansa city s ceaseless attack   and it come down to one almost too simple to believe concept that  if executed  will send the patriot to their ninth super bowl in   year <BRK>put a pin in that for a moment  first  after charting each and every play from the patriot and chief  week six match up  there were a few specific approach new england s defense took which led to short stint of success <BRK>     the patriot threw out their traditional base defense altogether  although malcom brown being sidelined with an injury from the prior week led to increased snap and le rest for the three active interior defensive lineman   lawrence guy  danny shelton  and adam butler   it became clear from the onset that the patriot were never going to match any of kansa city s heavy personnel grouping with four dl look anyways  instead  the patriot opted for mobility up front  using three linebacker on just      of play  and never using a personnel grouping heavier than       big nickel the entire game   even on the goal line <BRK>     the defense held up against kansa city s vaunted rpos pretty well  the chief used them   time   nine running play and four passing play  however  sound assignment integrity and tackling work by the patriot  linebacker and secondary held these typically lethal play to a total of   yard      yard per play   and just two first down <BRK>     brian flores dialed up well timed  key blitz  the patriot brought more than four rusher on eight different occasion in the contest and consistently changed where the additional rusher came from <BRK>patrick mahomes went four for eight against these blitz for   yard and one touchdown  which came from the new england one yard line in the fourth quarter  in total  the patriot forced three field goal try in their own territory with these blitz  <BRK>     the patriot constantly showed mahomes pre snap blitz look throughout the game  and would often have each  blitzer  engage blocker post snap  only to have a few   or all   of them fall back underneath into coverage  not only did this have the desired effect of disguising where the pressure would be coming from  but it helped to obfuscate potential lane of escape from the pocket for mahomes  this concept led directly to dont a hightower s first quarter interception <BRK>all of these approach helped to stall drive and slow down the league s most dynamic attack  however  there wa one effective aspect of new england s defensive game plan that gave kansa city s offense more issue than any other   the one almost too simple to believe component that  if harnessed and fully utilized on sunday in kansa city  will send the patriot to atlanta <BRK>man coverage <BRK>seriously  man coverage  it s that simple  <BRK>the patriot defensive scheme is often referred to a a  press man heavy   but in actuality  they ve used man coverage on around    of pasing play in    in week six against the chief they used it      of the time   and when they didn t  they paid the price <BRK>yes  that s real  of patrick mahomes    passing yard in week six    came against zone coverage  including kareem hunt s   yard third quarter touchdown  and tyreek hill s   yard game tying touchdown in the fourth quarter  seven of the   completion against the patriot  zone coverage went for first down  and all seven went for over   yard <BRK>against man coverage  the patriot allowed five first down on five more pas attempt  but mahomes failed to complete a pas over   yard  and both of new england s interception came against their man scheme <BRK>the disparity also extends to the chief usage of play action  not to be confused with rpo   mahomes and company used play action six time   twice against man  and four time against zone  against man  the patriot had an interception and allowed a   yard completion  against zone  mahomes went three for four and notched   yard and a touchdown <BRK>so why wa man coverage so effective against the chief while zone coverage wa not  the biggest factor wa yac   yard after the catch  against zone  kansa city averaged     air yard per catch  but after the catch  they racked up   yard  that s an additional     yard tacked onto each reception  against man coverage  the chief we re held to just   yard after the catch      avg  yac  <BRK>the second major factor is the nature of zone coverage itself  it allows free release off of the line of scrimmage which can allow the offense s timing to remain on schedule through the initial stage of the play design  it can lead to disadvantageous personnel match ups for the defense  crease naturally occur on the backside of rpos  and  often time  there is no defender trailing the intended passing target in coverage  <BRK>andy reid s scheme is the kryptonite for each of these shortcoming   particularly with regard to taking advantage of a zone s reactionary flow resulting from an rpo or biting on a play action fake  and he us formation  motion  spacing  and angle perfectly to get his skill position player in position to inflict the most damage  <BRK>in week six  patrick mahomes consistently threw well placed football to allow his guy to slice through seam of the patriot zone  see  tyreek hill s   yard touchdown   and  a the second year stud kept initially well defended play alive by escaping the pocket  the integrity of those zone became stressed and began to break down  leading to big play <BRK>are there risk to playing man coverage against the kind of weapon that the chief have  sure  but by playing man to man  you limit yard after the catch  you decrease the size of the window mahomes ha to throw into  and you force their play maker to continuously make more difficult play <BRK>perhaps more importantly  it would force a young quarterback venturing into the high pressure environment of an afc championship game for the first time to play near perfect football   a tall order  <BRK><BRK>
