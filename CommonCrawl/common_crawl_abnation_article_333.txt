against the ram  led by a franchise record   receiving yard for wide receiver michael thomas  it wa one of only three loss for the ram all year <BRK>giving up most of those yard wa marcus peter   a two time pro bowl cornerback  who hasn t lived up to the hype after he wa traded to the ram from the chief in february  kansa city got a   second round pick and change out of the deal  while the ram got a cornerback who gave up six touchdown and a     passer rating during the regular season <BRK>but peter  rough day against new orleans gave u something spicy for the rematch  the cornerback wa out for some revenge against saint coach sean payton <BRK>according to pro football focus  peter wa in coverage for seven of thomas  reception and gave up   of the receiver s   yard in week    about half of the yardage given up by peter came on one   yard touchdown in the final minute of the game <BRK>you can t guard mike     fox  gosaints  cantguardmike pic twitter com ire pp td<BRK>after the game  payton wa asked about the touchdown  and whether or not he wa surprised to see peter   who typically play on the right side of the field   match up with thomas on the left side <BRK> that wa the plan   payton said  via the los angeles time   they were going to travel marcu to him  and that wa fine by u  we thought we really liked that matchup   a lot  <BRK>that comment didn t sit well with peter  he wa asked about it in the locker room and made it clear that he wa looking forward to another chance to play the saint <BRK>marcus peter look forward to playing the saint again  and sharing a bowl of gumbo with sean payton  pic twitter com w kpmm p m<BRK> tell sean payton keep talking that shit  we re going to see him soon   peter said   you feel me  i liked what he wa saying on the sideline too  so i ll tell  him   keep talking that shit and i hope you see me soon  you feel me  and then we re going to have a nice little bowl of gumbo together  <BRK>peter ha never been shy about saying what he feel  so it s not too surprising that he wa so candid after the game  he s given the football world great quote like  shit  where we going  home   after the chief  playoff loss a year ago  there wa also this gem in   after he wa asked about forcing a fumble <BRK> that made my game from hella weak to weak  you feel me  i m not hella weak  i m just weak this week  next week i ll get back on my shit though so yeah  <BRK>it wa also unsurprising that payton deflected question about peter  comment rather than stoke any kind of flame <BRK>ram  marcus peter had some not so kind word to say about  saint hc sean payton this week  tell sean payton to keep talking that s     we going to see him soon  you feel me  payton wa asked about those comment today  pic twitter com  p bu wbzb<BRK> he s a competitor and we re focused on this game   wa all payton gave reporter  in the lead up to the nfc championship  he wa a little more forthcoming  but still respectful <BRK> he s someone that we grew real close to in the evaluation process   payton said wednesday  via the athletic   he s from the bay area and i used to recruit that area  we came close to drafting him the year we took andrus  peat   it wa peat and peter  i have great respect for him  and it s all good  <BRK>peter also tried to dial back the talk about there being a beef between he and payton <BRK>marcus peter talking about sean payton and the gumbo comment  pic twitter com  tqq ivqdu<BRK> all respect to sean payton and what he doe   peter said   during the game thing were happening  and i just love the fact that he s a competitor      it wan t nothing to be disrespectful or anything like that  i wa pissed off  i didn t have the game i wanted to have  <BRK>it s unclear if payton actually said anything to peter from the sideline during the game  that wouldn t be surprising  though  after all  payton wa the coach who taunted viking fan with a skol clap right before the minneapolis miracle made him put his foot in his mouth <BRK>in the divisional round  michael thomas had   reception for   yard and one touchdown  it wa a ridiculously great performance  while peter gave up six reception for   yard against the dallas cowboy <BRK>so on the surface  it sure looked like the saint were well set up to pick on peter again in the nfc championship <BRK>that didn t come to fruition  though  thomas finished with only   receiving yard and the saint struggled to find any big play against the ram defense <BRK>peter wa on the hunt for his revenge  on monday  he twice tweeted  it s gumbo week let s eat   but deleted the tweet both time <BRK>ram cb  marcuspeters is ready for the saint   pic twitter com c wnyfk e<BRK>after the game  he opted against having a bowl of gumbo <BRK>marcus peter   i don t even like gumbo  i wa just bullshitting y all  <BRK>peter ha played better since his rough day against the saint to begin november  in the first nine week  peter gave up six touchdown with only one interception  quarterback had an astronomical     passer rating when throwing his way <BRK>but in the final eight week of the regular season  he didn t give up another touchdown  caught two interception  and only gave up   reception  the passer rating for throw his direction wa just     in the back half of the year <BRK>on wednesday  he reminded reporter that it s too early to fully evaluate his season <BRK>energy  marcuspeters pic twitter com wqszisxruq<BRK>it also didn t help new orleans that drew brees didn t finish the season at his best  he underthrew two deep pass against the eagle that should ve been touchdown  one wa intercepted on the first play from scrimmage  and the second wa knocked away from taysom hill <BRK>the saint didn t have a much luck throwing peter  way sunday a they did in week   <BRK>
