early in the first period against the chicago blackhawks  jesperi kotkaniemi wa in position to open the scoring and get a lead for a montreal canadiens team in need of a bounce back performance  getting the first goal of the game would have been instrumental in boosting the confidence of a struggling group  the team would have come out of the gate  taken control  and responded to the word of some of the team leader after a difficult loss to the new york islander <BRK>but instead of feeding a pas to kotkaniemi  left wide open on the flank of corey crawford  joel armia turned in his position in the slot and fired the puck wide of the cage  erasing what would have been one of the habs  best scoring chance in the game <BRK>the most frustrating part of that sequence wa that kotkaniemi had earned that scoring chance <BRK>he supported a pressured breakout and sprung jonathan drouin for the offensive rush by taking possession of the puck after it bounced off a couple of skate  while spinning away from a check  he connected with his teammate  giving him space to skate wide into the neutral zone <BRK>after entering the offensive zone  kotkaniemi went up to the opposite faceoff circle and quickly changed direction to lose his coverage and get to the net a soon a he saw victor mete preparing a point shot  that shot deflected to armia  which gave the occaion to the finnish player to turn and connect with a cross creae one timer that would have needed a miraculous save by crawford   <BRK>but that scenario didn t happen  <BRK>armia is a good defensive forward  and a great puck protector  but he is not a game changer offensively  he doesn t usually have the poise to quickly look over his shoulder with space in the slot to locate a linemate in a better position  he is not that kind of playmaker   or even finisher for that matter  <BRK>kotkaniemi is not yet the player he should become in a few year  but if the above situation between him and armia were reversed  it is a solid bet that the youngest player in the nhl would have had the poise to find his finnish counterpart with a tape to tape pas  giving him  for half a second  an empty cage to shoot at <BRK>down     in an important game for the playoff  it is not player like armia  or jordan weal  who wa a few second from a career high in ice time on saturday   who will make the difference for you  weal ha been a bit of a revelation since coming to montreal  the productive junior player turned journeyman ha more skill than the usual depth forward  but it remains that he doesn t posse the vision or offensive instinct of kotkaniemi <BRK>contrary to weal  kotkaniemi had limited ice time in the third period due to defensive lapse  on his lat couple of shift  he pinched up the wall a the third man high on the forecheck  trying to take away the puck from a rushing forward in the neutral zone  leading to two on one against <BRK>those play were mistake  he wa not the only one at fault in the sequence   the other forward were late in their forechecking pressure both time   but it wa kotkaniemi s role to position himself better to intercept the rush <BRK>that being said  by employing a shorter leah on kotkaniemi against chicago a a result of those mistake  the coaching staff also effectively limited their own possible move with the clock ticking down and the habs heading toward another loss <BRK>safe is death  the habs have been winning with an aggressive mentality  taking away one of their best offensive weapon in the making in an important situation go against what they have been trying to accomplish since the start of the season <BRK>the coaching staff ha placed kotkaniemi between brendan gallagher and toma tatar at time this year  with some good result  but they seem to have gotten away from this strategy  the team a a whole is slipping away from what made them successful <BRK>in do or die moment  montreal should be relying on kotkaniemi  who can see play others don t  just like they rely on their best offensive element by pairing them together to give the team the most offensive potential <BRK>this season wa supposed to be a rebuilding year from the start  they chose to bring on their recent   year old draftee and make him part of the team  even if they fall short of the goal of making the post season  by using kotkaniemi in such important situation  they are still filling another much larger objective  which is giving valuable experience to their centre of the future <BRK>
