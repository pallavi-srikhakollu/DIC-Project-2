the first thursday of the ncaa tournament is always one of the best day on the sport calendar  when you have the opportunity to kick back and watch   hour of non stop college basketball involving   of the best team in the country  it s impossible to have a bad time   <BRK> with that being said  if we re viewing thing relative to the ghost of march madness past  the opening thursday of the   ncaa tournament wa     a little lacking  there were a couple of tremendous individual performance by a pair of mid major star  but not enough competitive game  not enough memorable moment  and really no terrific finish   <BRK> and yet there s still so much to talk about  how could there not be  we just rolled through   game without taking a breather   <BRK> let s examine all the best and the worst from the process of trimming   team down to     <BRK>        maryland        belmont    east  <BRK> thursday s most competitive game came in the east region  where maryland and belmont went back and forth before one final defensive stop by the terrapin ended the bruin  hope of dancing deeper into the tournament   <BRK> down one and with under   second to play  belmont tried to run the same  panic  backdoor play they used in the exact same situation to notch a win over ucla earlier this season   <BRK> unfortunately for rick byrd s team  maryland appeared prepared  eric ayala deflected a pas intended for a cutting dylan windler  and the terrapin were escape with their first win in the big dance   <BRK>        auburn        new mexico state    midwest  <BRK> though the score wa close enough for most of the afternoon  this game wa never a work of art  especially in the final minute   but we ll get into that more later in the post  still  on a day where tight game were at a premium  this get the nod for the no    spot   <BRK> both new mexico state and auburn entered the tournament ranking in the top   nationally in attempted three pointer  but neither shot it particularly well on this day  the tiger  netting   trey to nmsu s seven helped negate the litany of error bruce pearl s team made down the stretch and helped them avoid becoming the first major upset of the   tournament   <BRK>        baylor        syracuse    west   <BRK> you know it wan t a particularly compelling opening thursday when this score is occupying the no    spot on the best game list  but for   minute or so  baylor and syracuse played a highly entertaining game that most of america wa ignoring while it watched wofford and seton hall   who would have claimed this spot had the terrier not pulled away so thoroughly at the end    shoot it out on cbs   <BRK> people talk about team that play predominantly zone not liking to play against other team that play predominantly zone  but there didn t appear to be any truth to that old adage in this game  syracuse buried   of   from three  only to be outgunned by a baylor squad that wa a scorching   of   from deep   <BRK> the game wa tied at   with just under   minute to go when syracuse started a field goal drought that lasted nearly five minute  that wa more than enough of an opening for baylor to seize control and ultimately cruise to it first tournament win over a single digit seed since     <BRK>    murray state  <BRK> murray state toppling marquette wa the trendiest double digit upset pick heading into the tournament  and the racer made their strong contingent of believer look very  very smart on thursday afternoon  ja morant  more on him coming  and company controlled the action from start to finish and ran away with an     win that never really felt in doubt   <BRK> the   point margin of victory by murray state wa the second largest ever for a   seed over a    in    eastern michigan defeated mississippi state by     <BRK>    kansa  <BRK> kansa is seeded worse than first or second in the tournament for the first time in over a decade  maybe they should try it out more often  the jayhawks shot     percent from the field and got monster game from dedric lawson    point    rebound  and devon dotson    point  on their way to a dominant     win over northeastern   <BRK>    minnesota  <BRK> the golden gopher entered the ncaa tournament a the worst three point shooting team from a major conference  averaging just     made three per game  of the   team in division i  only three got a fewer percentage of their point from the three point shot  you wouldn t have thought it if you d watched minnesota on thursday  the gophs dropped   three pointer and shot     percent from the field in an     upset of   seed louisville  the win had to feel especially sweet for richard pitino  who  according to various medium report  had a family member who used to be the head coach of the cardinal   <BRK>    nevada <BRK> on one hand  it feel unfair to punish nevada for being more or le the same team we ve seen all season long  on the other  the tournament wa the perfect opportunity for the wolf pack to finally wake up and play to their potential  that didn t happen   <BRK> nevada continued it season long trend of listless start  bizarre decision making on offense  and overall underwhelming play in a     upset loss to florida  despite all that returning and new talent  a team that began the season ranked no    and spent much of the year ranked in the top    ended it     campaign without ever making any real impact on the season  they were just sort of  there   and now that s how they ll always be remembered  at least by those who remember them at all   <BRK>    northeastern  <BRK> a seemingly vulnerable kansa team facing a   seed that take   percent of it shot from beyond the arc and make just under   percent of those triple made northeastern something of a wise guy upset pick entering thursday  the husky couldn t come close to making that happen  they struggled all day to keep kansa  guard from getting into the lane  and clanged   of their   three point attempt on the other end of the floor  the result wa a   point stomping that wa more reminiscent of some of kansa  recent   v    tilt  <BRK>    fairleigh dickinson  <BRK> they lost to gonzaga by a billion point  but the real reason they re here is just so i can make this joke one last time while i still have the chance   <BRK> until next year  dickinson joke  you ll be missed   <BRK>    the last minute of auburn new mexico state  <BRK> a double digit seed coming within a shot of knocking off a power conference champion is supposed to provide the type of excitement that defines the tournament s opening weekend  anyone who watched the waning moment of auburn s     win over new mexico state know that particular game didn t fit that narrative   <BRK> auburn did everything possible down the stretch   missing free throw  fouling wayyy too early  leaving three point shooter wide open   to hand the game to new mexico state  but the aggies weren t particularly interested in accepting   <BRK> the game ended with auburn missing a free throw to give new mexico state a chance to tie or take the lead  aggie guard a j  harris racing down the court and then inexplicably passing up a wide open layup to kick the ball out to teammate terrell brown  brown missing a game winning three pointer but getting fouled  brown missing two of the three free throw but nmsu getting the ball back after auburn lost the rebound out of bound  and then finally  trevelin queen somehow getting a wide open look for the potential game winner  but badly air balling it   <BRK> phew   <BRK> auburn survives a wild finish  pic twitter com kau nualp <BRK> ricky o donnell ha an even more in depth look at everything that went wrong for both team down the stretch   <BRK>    bruno fernando s botched dunk attempt <BRK> i guess sometimes being wide open and also built like a super hero can be a bad combination   <BRK>   marchmadness pic twitter com  oltjxp c <BRK> it s ok  the maryland star still finished with   point    rebound and four assist in the terrapin victory over belmont   <BRK>        p m  to     p m   est  <BRK> for   entire minute  we were left without any basketball to watch on thursday  that s unacceptable  this is exactly why we started staggering the tip time    <BRK> you know what happened in those   minute  my mind started to wander  i started wondering if my current lifestyle wa so unhealthy that it wa going to be a problem when i return to the real world after the tournament  i started wondering if there wa a family member i needed to call and check in on  i started to think about how much my wife secretly resents me for not being able to help out with literally anything at the moment   <BRK> i don t need these thought right now  that s why these gap are unacceptable  don t let it happen again   <BRK>    tom izzo  <BRK> for year  tom izzo ha had the type of relationship with his player where he s been able to get in their face a little bit without it seeming overly confrontational  his back and forth with aaron henry on thursday  however  wa more heated than anything we ve seen before   <BRK> tom izzo go after aaron henry pretty hard  pic twitter com a kumt xwa <BRK> chill out  dude   <BRK> izzo wa also testy when he wa asked about the exchange during his postgame press conference   <BRK> tom izzo wa asked about getting after aaron henry  i don t know what kind of business you re in  but i tell ya what  if i wa a head of a newspaper  and you didn t do your job  you d be held accountable   pic twitter com kqcwykuy x <BRK> yeah  maybe not the best analogy to use when trying to justify your behavior in this specific situation   <BRK> in recent year we ve seen izzo make something of a transition from lovable  doe thing the right way  coach to a gruff  more abrasive leader who on multiple occasion ha been forced to justify his action  maybe it s just the memory of all the recent first weekend loss that had him seeming a little unhinged on thursday   <BRK> michigan state woke up late to dispatch of  th seeded bradley        <BRK>    no quality finish  <BRK> we didn t need three buzzer beater or anything to qualify this a a quality day  but come on  you ve gotta give u something  the only two game on thursday that came down to the final possession ended with a turnover and a wide open three that wa airballed by approximately   foot   <BRK> do better  friday   <BRK>    ja morant <BRK> anyone who still wasn t aware of ja morant s existence before thursday no longer ha an excuse   <BRK> the soon to be multi millionaire put on an absolute show in murray state s     route of marquette  finishing with   point    assist and   rebound  morant became just the eighth player ever to produce a triple double in the ncaa tournament  and the first since draymond green in     <BRK> ja morant ha become the  th player to record a triple double in the tournament since asist became an official stat in      he join draymond green   x cole aldrichdwyane wadeandre millerdavid

last decade  via  espnstatsinfo   he will face the toughest test of his college career to date on saturday when the racer go up against the supremely large and athletic fourth seeded seminole of florida state   <BRK>    fletcher magee s record setting day  <BRK> with seven made trey in wofford s     win over seton hall  fletcher magee passed former oakland sharp shooter travis bader to become

reason why the terrier are moving on to the second round of the ncaa tournament for the first time in program history   <BRK>    lsu <BRK> is this ok  is this something we should be cheering  i don t even know  who care  <BRK> a   seed playing without it head coach at the start of a tournament run that s almost certainly going to be vacated by the ncaa is sort of uncharted territory  but maybe that s what make it     fun  again  this is weird   <BRK> lsu led   seed yale comfortably for most of the afternoon in jacksonville  but a late flurry from the bulldog that included four three pointer in the game s final minute created some anxious moment for the tiger at the free throw line  skyler may stepped up to the occasion and sank all his freebie to lock up a     win  lsu s first ncaa tournament win in a decade   <BRK> let me know if this isn t ok    <BRK>    ja morant s dad <BRK> zion williamson is going to be taken no    in this summer s nba draft  but that s ok with papa morant  who think his son need to be selected with pick zero   <BRK> i asked ja morant s dad where he should go in the nba draft after this performance  is there anything before one   pic twitter com  ib qelwcb <BRK> the entire morant family can do no wrong in my eye   <BRK>    kentucky s wildcat v  wildcat trend continues <BRK> with their     rout of abilene christian now in the book  three of kentucky s last four ncaa tournament game have come against team that are also nicknamed the wildcat  what s weirder is the only reason why that streak isn t four straight is because buffalo upset the arizona wildcat in the first round of last year s tournament to face uk in round two  <BRK> look  i know this cheer isn t great  but you have to at least say something about kentucky in these thing or all hell break loose  you deal with this subpar cheer so i don t have to deal with the email  that s the deal we re making here   <BRK> kentucky go from wildcat to terrier  wofford  on saturday   <BRK>    jalen smith  maryland  <BRK> not only wa this dunk the most vicious of day one  it also served a arguably the biggest moment in the final minute of maryland s     win over belmont   <BRK>
