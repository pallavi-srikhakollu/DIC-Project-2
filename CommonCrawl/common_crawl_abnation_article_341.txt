   <BRK> on the final play of regulation  the oklahoma city thunder trail by three with five second left on the clock  russell westbrook receives the ball in the back court and began darting up the floor  the lakers had a foul to give  and knew to use it before westbrook start shooting  that would force the thunder to restart the play with le time on the clock  <BRK> right around the time westbrook got near the three point line  lonzo ball grabbed him  westbrook  after being contacted  went up for a jump shot  despite the timing  the referee called this a shooting foul and awarded him three shot  westbrook made all three  sending the game to overtime  <BRK> russell westbrook is on the ground  hasn t started his shooting motion  foul on lonzo wa garbage  it ll be a miracle if the young lakers win thispic twitter com du g iesf <BRK> so what really is  in the shooting motion  rule      asking for a friend  officialnbarefs  <BRK> the lakers won this game in the extra stanza  which is equal part impressive on their end and disappointing on okc s  given they have two all star with championship aspiration   <BRK> but after the game  a pool reporter asked nba official tom wahington about the foul call  wahington said he called the foul because  at the time  he thought russell had started his shooting motion and he wa clearly behind the three point line    <BRK> the next question wa even more important  <BRK> wahington s answer wa the one he wa supposed to give   <BRK> the referee admitted it should have been called a non shooting foul on lonzo ball when russell westbrook got three free throw to close out regulation with a tie  pic twitter com  x xkunxf  <BRK>  there is not a trigger to review whether or not there is a foul prior to or on the shot  the trigger would be whether it is a three point shot or not  and upon being able to see the review of the play  we realized that the illegal contact actually happened prior to the upward motion  so it should ve been a side out   <BRK> in other word  we missed the call  but replay rule won t let u overturn it  <BRK> let s unpack that further  the nba ha a list of act or situation that are allowed to be reviewed with instant replay in the final two minute of a game  but determining whether a foul is in the act of shooting is not one of them  even though the officiating crew realized the foul occurred before the shot  they could not use instant replay a a bais to give the ball back to oklahoma city for an inbounds play  the blown call had to stand  <BRK> that wa too late  had this game not gone the lakers  way  the botched foul call would have been the reason why  <BRK>

   <BRK> on one level  it s understandable why a shooting motion foul isn t reviewable  it open the door for everything to be reviewable  which in turn  could turn a game into into a lifelong affair delayed by player incessantly begging referee to review everything in the final two minute  that could turn an amazing nba product into one people get tired of because of too many stoppage of play late in game  plus  there will always be an unforeseen reviewable circumstance that even the most iron clad rule will overlook  <BRK> but on the flip side  game can be decided by critical call  made or missed  that s one of the reaon why the nba s lat two minute report became so popular in recent year  official can t retroactively go back and change a call   unless it s a technical foul that s later rescinded by the league   but the l m report at leat offer a bit of transparency a to what call and which official are wrong in crunch time  <BRK> maybe the answer lie somewhere in the middle  maybe everything in the final minute of a close game is up for review  at the official s discretion  that way  official don t have to live and die by a call they made on the court in the heat of the moment that turn out to be dead wrong   like the shooting foul on westbrook that nearly cost the young lakers their biggest win of the season  <BRK> it s a tough situation  but the nba ha been smart about adapting on the fly  hopefully  no team take bad loss before they do  <BRK>
