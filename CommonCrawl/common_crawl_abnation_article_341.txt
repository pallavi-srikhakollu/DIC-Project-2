every year when the field is set there is one thing you can count on with march madness  it will be exactly that   madness  <BRK>we saw a perfect example of that on sunday afternoon  a the vols bolted out to a phenomenal start taking a     lead into the halftime locker room  it brought a welcome feeling of comfort to the tennessee player and fan alike who have had to endure some heart palpitating game a of late  that feeling would disappear quickly a the iowa hawkeyes caught fire out of the halftime break  <BRK>in the blink of an eye  that   point lead turned into a tie game with just     left in the second half after jordan bohannon sank three free throw to pull the hawkeyes even  when it wa all said and done vol nation wa able to let out a huge sigh of relief a tennessee outscored iowa     in bonus time to take the  nd round match up by a score of     in overtime <BRK>it s a well known fact that anything can happen in college baketball when march roll around and there is no lack of solid baketball team still playing  the sweet sixteen produce another tough match up for the vols a they will meet purdue in louisville on thursday in hope of advancing to just their second elite eight in school history <BRK>purdue made easy work of villanova on saturday night  beating the wildcat      if the vols hope to dispose of the boilermakers en route to the elite eight  they will need to play better than they did this past weekend  i believe there are three  must  for tennessee if they hope to move on in the ncaa tournament <BRK>contain carsen edward <BRK>slowing down the big ten s leading scorer  carsen edward  ha been eaier said than done for purdue opponent all year long  the junior guard is not afraid to shoot the baketball a he took   shot this seaon with   of them coming from behind the arc  he averaged   point per contest in big ten play this seaon while shooting    from the field and    from three  <BRK>the vols have been susceptible to the long ball throughout the seaon and even more so within the lat month  with that being such a big part of edward  game  tennessee will need to make sure they are all over him defensively thursday  it look a if that duty will primarily fall on the shoulder of guard lamonte turner  turner ha been a solid defender in   and ha often taken on the role of defending dangerous  opposing guard for the vols  both jordan bone and jordan bowden may also see some time defending the star purdue guard  with edward being the heart of the boilermakers and by far their most consistent scorer  i think this will be one of the most important factor on thursday  <BRK>i think the three previously mentioned guy will do a solid job of slowing edward down  but if he get hot the vols could be in trouble  i m not sure if rick barnes would actually do it  but i ve said all year long that if the vols really want to lock an opponent down  yves pons can defend just about anybody  with a lot of work to do to refine his raw skill  his athleticism and quickness are up there with just about anyone in the country and i think he could certainly defend the shifty edward and do a fine job of it if barnes want to put a bigger body on him  <BRK>continue to feed grant williams<BRK>tennessee ha an embarrassment of rich when it come to having player the can score the basketball  the vols are loaded with guy who can score both inside and from behind the three point line  however  throughout the season there have been many instance where the offense hit an abrupt lull and find themselves unable to consistently score point  not every time  but quite a few of those time this wa the result of the vols getting too  shot happy  from outside  with so many good three point shooter  it s easy to see why that style of play can be tempting  however  tennessee is at it best when they feed the back to back sec player of the year grant williams <BRK>the junior forward averaged just shy of   point per game while shooting a stellar    from the field  williams can be an absolute nightmare for opposing team when he get in his groove  his ability to produce bucket when getting the ball in the post is top in the conference and up there with the just about anyone in the ncaa  he s also adept at drawing contact and getting to the free throw line where he shoot at an    clip  while not very tall  his wide frame and the height he get on the turn around jump shot give him the ability to shoot over many collegiate defender from just a few foot from the basket  another aspect of williams  game that ha given defender fit is his ability to drive to the basket when getting the ball at the elbow  countless time that sequence ha ended with the vols getting three point the hard way  <BRK>the vols have a high powered offense that can score the ball and when williams ha it going  it open the floor up for everyone else  admiral schofield  lamonte turner  and jordan bone all see their efficiency and shooting improve when williams is being productive and drawing the double team that allow them open shot  a it ha been for the lat couple year and will be on thursday  tennessee will go a grant williams go  <BRK>finish the game<BRK>possibly the most apparent takeaway from last round s match up  the vols must do a better job of finishing the game strong  the aforementioned offensive lull wa a huge factor in why the hawkeyes were able to creep back into the second round game  iowa outscored tennessee     on the way to tying the game up near the two minute mark in the second half and the vols would only score   point the entire half  <BRK>you don t have to go back too far to find another example of the vols doing a dismal job of closing out a big game  just two day prior to the iowa game  the vols let an overmatched colgate squad come storming back from a double digit half time deficit to take a brief lead with ten minute left in the game before the raider lost by just seven point in a game they were seventeen point dog  <BRK>if tennessee get lackluster on defense and are unable to stay out of foul trouble again  they will have a tough time again down the stretch in what many believe will be a tight game  neither colgate or iowa had a player near the caliber of carsen edward  he is the kind of player that can turn those tennessee offensive lull from close win to devastating loss  <BRK>nonetheless  we should all be in for a treat on thursday a the volunteer look to get to their second elite eight in program history  if they are able to slow edward down  get grant  williams the ball  and put the pedal to the metal in the second half then they will be looking to make history two day later a they play for a trip to minneapolis to take part in their first ever final four  if not  they ll be back in knoxville enjoying the game from the couch with the rest of u  i think we can all agree  we want that trip to minnesota <BRK><BRK><BRK>
