the transfer bug is biting virginia tech s football program again   <BRK> in late january  quarterback josh jackson  who started in the   and   season before suffering a season ending injury in september    announced he ll leave to play football elsewhere  earlier in the day  hokies head coach justin fuente released this statement   <BRK> a head coach i certainly understand when young men desire to explore their option by entering themselves in the ncaa s transfer portal  i respect the fact that each individual s circumstance and situation are different  we will continue to support all our student athlete and wish them best whether their future is at virginia tech or another institution  <BRK> the statement is a little odd   it s not often you hear head coach doing public damage control in this fashion when player transfer   but fuente ha suffered a ton of attrition over the last year  jackson  who threw for     yard and   touchdown during his redshirt freshman year in    wa expected to return to vt in    though report swirled near the beginning of the   season that he might leave the program then   <BRK> also   <BRK> source  alabama is expected to hire virginia tech wide receiver coach holmon wiggins for the same position  wiggins also had been in the mix for a coordinator role at temple  i m hearing virginia tech could target jafar williams  most recently    http   t co agjlsafrqo <BRK> throughout lat year  the hokies saw a slew of departure on defense that weren t because eligibility clock ran out  they lost   player and roughly a whole defense s worth of production and upside  plus co coordinator galen scott in the spring  the loss included first round pick tremaine and terrell edmunds and defensive end trevon hill  who wa dismissed during the seaon a the team s leader in tackle for loss   <BRK> if there s any good news these day  it s that the hokies aren t losing anyone with eligibility remaining to the   draft  on another hand  that s partly a product of already losing a lot  sending player to the draft is usually the sign of a healthy program   <BRK> i wrote after the hokies  military bowl loss to cincinnati that while thing were bad in    there wa reason to expect improvement in     <BRK> jackson  who threw for     yard and   touchdown during his redshirt freshman year in    should be ready to go next year  he ll lose running back steven people  but much or all of his receiving corp should be back  the offensive line had three senior starting  so the hokies will need answer there  <BRK> on defense  the hokies should return a handful of their leading tackler  with an nfl decision from junior edge defender reggie floyd still on the table  only five starter from the military bowl are out of eligibility  just one of the defender atop the bowl game two deep  dt ricky walker  is guaranteed to move on  <BRK> so this team could have a lot of key returners  though after the offseason tech just had  no one can say for sure what the roster will look like  <BRK> but it would just be hard to have the same attrition two year in a row  bad season can happen to the best head coach  and few are denying fuente s ability after just this year  if the hokies aren t better next year  though  his outlook could shift  <BRK> fuente s    and nine win season in   and   give him some breathing room after a     season last year  if the hokies aren t better soon  though  his outlook could shift  any more of this turnover will only make having a better year harder   <BRK> hokies  <BRK>
