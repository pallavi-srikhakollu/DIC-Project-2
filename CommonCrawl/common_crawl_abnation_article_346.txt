if your college football program aspires to win the college football playoff national championship they ll almost have to sign a five star player in every class  doe a program win because they have five star kid or do five star kid sign because the program win is a chicken or egg question that would be tough to delve in to   <BRK> however  the proof is in the pudding  alabama  clemson  oklahoma  and georgia all sign their annual five star prospect  outside of an outlier recruiting class here and there  the tiger signed five     five star prospect per  sport in    yet not a single five star in    the crimson tide landed a pair of five star prospect in    and a pair in    the georgia bulldog signed seven     five star prospect in    and three more in the   class  notre dame hasn t signed a five star since offensive tackle tommy kraemer in   and while they made the semi final they were easily handled by the tiger  the sooner nabbed two five star in    and one in    oh and if thing hold up for    the ohio state buckeye will have signed around seven five star in three class   <BRK> alabama ha signed five star quarterback tua tagovailoa who helped the tide win a title in   and guided them to the big game in    for the   season   clemson s title winning quarterback in    a freshman in trevor lawrence  oklahoma s dual threat dual sport heisman trophy winning quarterback kyler murray  yes  another five star prospect coming out of high school   <BRK> recruiting is a big business driven by massive cattle call camp like the opening  elite    and  on  tournament played all over the country  recruiting guru like sb nation s bud elliot and   s brandon huffman make their living  i assume  anyway  via their keen eye and perceptive ability to track and analyze talent  trust me  i m the first person to say  star don t matter  people do   but in the world of college football  they re a big deal  coach receive bonus based on recruiting ranking and it s obvious that the best player win the most game   <BRK> the hurricane finally got back on the five star map in   with the signing of lorenzo lingard  lingard  the talented tailback from university high school in orange city looked promising before going down with a season ending injury  the youngster should be able to bounce back under dan enos and split touch with deejay dallas and cam ron harris    before lingard the reeling hurricane last five star wa defensive end chad thomas  thomas wa part of al golden s  th ranked class in     <BRK> do the hurricane need to sign a five star prospect in their   class  yes  they probably do  in order to hang with the elite program like alabama  georgia  clemson and oklahoma they ll need elite level talent  there s truly a monopoly on the four playoff spot and until the field widens to six or eight it will more than likely require a five star prospect somewhere on the roster   <BRK> a of february  th    there are only   five star prospect per   sport in the   recruiting cla  with the recent fake recruit blake carringer receiving three star  the validity of the recruiting website ha taken a hit but the truth remains  it s important for both the talent level and public perception to win recruiting war  of the   available five star three are listed a florida prep player  yet  miami may be more likely to pull a kid from d c   la vega  or california a they are from florida   <BRK> which five star doe miami have a shot at  how about six foot seven    pound tight end darnell washington from la vega  with miami currently having a trio of bishop gorman  lv  star the  cane could land this blue chipper from the desert  st  thomas aquinas wide receiver marcus rosemy is another five star that hasn t committed yet  the two florida kid coming in at   and   in the ranking are gator lock   <BRK> miami s   clas is sitting currently at  rd in the country  even ranked ahead of the defending national champion clemson tiger  but miami doesn t have a single five star locked in yet for that clas  yet alabama  lsu  florida  ohio state and oklahoma all do  if the  cane want to return to the elite recruiting and performance standard they set in the early   s a well a in the   s and   s elite prospect will have to be signed and it s not eay when the five star pool is only     of a signing clas per alex kirshner s research   <BRK> i believe sb nation s bill connelly coined the phrase that football program are built in three phae  acquisition  development  and deployment  that mean your program ha to have the best player  ha to develop them into winner  and ha to deploy them with great scheme and poise for   minute for   game in order to win the college football playoff national championship  that s a tall ask for anyone and there s a reason why only a handful of active coach have a championship ring  it take a special person to master all three phae   <BRK> can the new miami pull off a recruiting coup and land one of   five star prospect in the   class  most definitely  if anyone can do it  it is miami head football coach manny diaz with the fire he s bringing to coral gable  however  the  cane will have to prove they can play ball with program like alabama  clemson and florida who have sec like recruiting strategy thoroughly in place heading into the next recruiting cycle   <BRK>
