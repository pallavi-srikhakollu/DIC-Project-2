 th and   at the ram   yard line during the divisional round playoff game  the score wa      with the ram leading  and it wa the first play of the fourth quarter  dalla finally had some momentum a they were driving the ball on the ram  now  they faced a  th and    <BRK>this situation wa no longer a  gimme  for the dallas offense  the cowboy offensive line wa no longer capable of simply blowing opponent off the ball and allowing ezekiel elliott easy access to a few yard  with no travis frederick  with a rookie who had trouble at the point of attack in connor williams  and with a dinged up zack martin  the cowboy interior line wa at a disadvantage against a ram front that wa pretty darn good  we ll let david moore tell u what happened <BRK>did the cowboy rise to the occasion on this fourth and   <BRK>no  they plunged ezekiel elliott into the teeth of the ram defense  he wa stopped for no gain  la took over and went on a   yard scoring drive to ice the outcome <BRK>this play epitomizes a lack of creativity that frustrates critic inside and outside the organization <BRK>if your talent is superior to your opponent  by all mean line up and beat them physically  impose your will  make the game about simple execution <BRK>but talent is so evenly dispersed in the nfl  how many team can truly thrive with that bedrock philosophy  rather than telling a player to beat the man across from him  why not draw up something schematically to help him do it <BRK>that play ha been referenced hundred of time now to symbolize a cowboy offense that failed all too often in    it wa used a the final nail in the coffin for scott linehan by many  so let s take a look at that play and how it help to illustrate the cowboy dysfunction on offense <BRK>it s been noted how the ram use pre snap motion to confuse defense and get them out of position  the cowboy seemingly do the opposite here when they motion te rico gather out of the backfield to the end of the line of scrimmage  it s a run play and it is designed to go to the right behind zack martin and la el collins  this pre snap motion just brings more defender to that side of the line  <BRK>dallas follows that up by bringing blocking wr noah brown in from the outside to line up just behind the te tandem of gather and dalton schultz on the right side  there is no subterfuge here  this is just lining up and powering forward  creativity is right out the window <BRK>the ram play along and put nine men within five yard of the line of scrimmage  eight of them are within three yard of the line of scrimmage  they don t believe anything other than a run is coming  and the cowboy aren t to be bothered with calling an audible into something else  the die is cast <BRK>joe looney did a great job of filling in for travis frederick all year  he played better than anybody thought he would  still  there were time when fredrick wa missed and this wa one of them  that red circle is looney being pushed back by ndamukong suh  <BRK>this is a better view from the endzone angle  it look like elliott will be able to cut inside suh through the hole between looney and martin  but suh is in total control of looney and see elliott head for that hole  he easily cross over looney and smack elliott  stopping all momentum  from that point on the run is essentially dead although elliott give it his all  <BRK>there s been much said about the cowboy lining up in this tight formation and running the ball up the middle  the theory being   why not spread the defense out and then let elliott do his thing  but if we look at the play  in hindsight of course  there are creative thing the cowboy could have done from this formation  <BRK>they have a one on one with amari cooper at the bottom of the screen  they could have run cooper on a quick slant  black arrow  and dak prescott could have dropped a step and fired  there is no linebacker in the path of the ball  blue circle  so it would have all been on the ram corner to make the play  <BRK>or  even better  the cowboy have three eligible receiver on the right side of the line  brown  plus two tight end   if they wanted they could have run play action  you can see how the corner on that side is starting to charge the line  red circle arrow   and then released a couple of receiver into the zone on that side after faking a block for a second  yellow arrow   the ram just don t have enough player over there in position to make a play <BRK>yes  this is all easy to say after the play  but the cowboy could have had these audible ready to call if they saw the ram in this formation  it s called creativity  <BRK>there wa the dez bryant catch in green bay  ref blew that one  then there wa the missed blatant holding of david irving by the packer line when jared cook caught the pas that set up the game winning field goal  the ref blew that  and then there is this play  look at the red circle arrow  is there any more blatant occurrence of hand to the face than this  ethan westbrooks is about to push connor williams  head off his shoulder by pushing up on his facemask  no call  <BRK>the cowboy offense limped along all season  there wa plenty of blame to go around  this play sort of symbolized much of it  pre snap movement that telegraphed the play  instead of scheming around the defense  they plowed into the teeth of the defense  no creativity in going against tendency and attacking the weakness of the defensive formation  player unable to make the key play or block when needed  and since it wa a crucial play in the playoff  we get a blown call by the ref  <BRK>play like this cost scott linehan his job  if they continue  they will cost jason garrett his job  kellen moore is charged with changing it  let s hope he is up to the task  <BRK>
