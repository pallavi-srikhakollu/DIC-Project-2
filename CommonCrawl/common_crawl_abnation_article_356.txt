james harden ha been special for a while now  hell  in the past four year  he s won an mvp and come close to two others  harden is definitely a top five basketball player in the world  which is enormous praise considered the other four in the club are lebron james  stephen curry  kevin durant  and anthony davis  <BRK>what he s doing right now  over these last five week  is out of another universe  it s real time legend making <BRK>since dec     harden ha scored at least   point in all   game the rocket have played  in that span he s averaging   point  nine assist  seven rebound  and two steal per game while shooting   percent on   choking sound       three attempted per game  his true shooting percentage over this span is     percent  that mean that when you factor in three and free throw  he s shooting the equivalent of     percent from the floor  league average for all player this season is     percent  <BRK>by the way  the rocket are     over that stretch  despite being ravaged by injury <BRK>harden reached what should have been pinnacle last season  earning a well deserved mvp award and coming a single cold streak away from knocking off the most talented team ever assembled  that would be enough for most budding hall of famers  you could build a springfield induction speech of harden s     campaign  <BRK>he s clearly not satisfied  though  despite the rocket  dream of a title looking bleak for the first two month of the season  harden did what he could to keep the window pried open  now he s just clubbing it with a crowbar to get that championship breeze flowing through the toyota center again  <BRK>whether that will happen depends on a lot outside harden s control  chris paul s health  daryl morey s ability to add another piece before the season s out  mike d antoni s ability to cobble together some defense  the warrior  internal politics  and more  but this conversation wouldn t be a whisper if not for what harden ha done  <BRK>this is the new james harden legend  no matter what happens in april  may  and  heaven hold your breath  june  and no matter if this entrancing  hirsute spell last no longer than tomorrow  the lore of harden  the mythology of the beard  start right here with these back to back   spot  and a dozen and a half three on a tuesday  and all this overwhelming  all consuming excellence <BRK>this is peak iverson  but somehow more  this is peak kobe  but somehow better  this is peak mcgrady  but somehow easier  <BRK>yes  this is of that type of megalomaniac scoring  hungry  persistent  magical  unstoppable  it s different that what durant or curry or lebron or even canonical michael jordan or larry bird gave u   early jordan is more of this manner  but those image have been eclipsed in the popular imagination by the winter sunday and june of the   s on nbc   <BRK>curry  durant  and usually lebron are blue flame   a fire that spread quickly and subtly until there s nothing but ash and a   point quarter hanging off your forehead  those guy are a slow building crescendo  string and woodwind easing you to devastation of the highest order <BRK>the iversons  kobe  and hardens are all drum and high brass  there s no being surprised at the   in the scoring column on the boxscore after three quarter  you felt every bucket hit you in the jaw  yet this is typology  not qualitative assessment  <BRK>qualitatively  harden is much more like curry and durant than iverson and kobe  a i  wa messy and inefficient on and off the basketball court  kobe wa  is  a primadonna  a self aware and self important diva  a clever tennis prodigy trapped in a team sport   he wa also inefficient   curry and durant call back to title era jordan in term of incredible efficiency amid high usage  and harden s right there with them  well  he would be right there with them  if curry weren t resetting the standard by which we measure these thing  <BRK>curry ha the shooting advantage over harden  and durant ha the classic look and style  but the beard make up for that with sheer volume  in quantitative  sonic  and sartorial sens   <BRK>consider this fact about these three heroic scorer  curry and durant each have six career   point game  harden  the youngest of the bunch  ha    including four this season   iverson had   in slower time for a relatively short career  kobe had  choking sound     <BRK>
