major league baseball on friday announced the implementation of a pitch clock on a trial basis this spring  one day before the full slate of game begin in arizona and florida <BRK>for the first week or so the   second pitch clock will operate between pitch though with no enforcement  allowing player and umpire to get used to the process  after that  umpire will between inning inform team which player are violating the rule  though again no penalty will be attached <BRK>mlb said that  later in spring training  and after negotiating with the mlb player association  only then would it have umpire ass ball strike penalty for rule violation <BRK>there are a few detail to the pitch clock that will be used in spring training <BRK>mlb discussed adding a pitch clock last year though ultimately decided against it  instead implementing a limit on mound visit and a reduction of time between inning <BRK>the pitch clock for the regular seaon can technically be implemented by commissioner rob manfred  though the league ha expressed a willingness to compromise with the player union  a of now no decision ha been made whether to implement it during the   regular seaon  <BRK>opinion vary among player  dodger left hander rich hill told the l a  time the pitch clock wa  ridiculous   while pirate right hander j t  brubaker told mlb com   for the most part  it s something you don t really notice  <BRK>pitcher aren t the only one scrutinized by a pitch clock  though they will understandably bear the brunt of most punishment under any new rule  batter are required to be  in the batter box and alert  by the five second mark of the timer <BRK>a of now there are no penalty built into the pitch clock  but mlb note that any potential penalty enforced by umpire will be  ball strike  related <BRK>the last pace related rule implemented by mlb wa a limit on the number of mound visit in    to six per team for a nine inning game  player and team hemmed and hawed over this during spring training  but for the most part the change worked with nary a hitch  team rarely even approached the mound visit cap last year  they were able to easily make the necessary adjustment <BRK>this wa a far cry from previous year  dodger manager dave robert mentioned a game in august   during which the diamondback visited the mound   time against them  nineteen <BRK>though these are more about pace  the average game time in mlb in   wa three hour  four minute  down four minute from    mlb game have averaged at least three hour for the last seven season  <BRK>grant brisbee two year ago painstakingly analyzed video of two game three decade apart and found the bulk of the difference in game time between   and   wa captured in the time between pitch  that s what this pitch clock will try to combat <BRK>taking a gander at yasiel puig s home run in game   of the   world series  there were five pitch in the at bat  the last four of which would be measured against a pitch clock if this rule wa in place then  this isn t exact  but a rough estimate show that eduardo rodriguez took more than   second all four time <BRK>rodriguez averaged     second between pitch using pitchf x data during the regular season in    and he s not alone <BRK>of the   pitcher to throw at least   inning last year  all but six averaged more than   second in between pitch uing this metric  though it is more of an estimate that sometimes capture delay like stepping off a mound  for instance  this pace metric give u a rough idea of who some of the slowest worker in the game are  six pitcher averaged more than   second in between pitch  and they seem more likely to be most affected by this new rule  if implemented <BRK>while you could feature a full length commercial between the pitch of this sextet  on average  they all happened to perform well in    posting a collective     era while averaging   strikeout per nine inning <BRK>for now  we have roughly four week worth of spring training game to see of the pitch clock experiment will work  my guess is player will adjust  eventually  and this is something we ll mostly forget about until a pitcher get assessed a ball penalty and walk in a run in the world series <BRK>
