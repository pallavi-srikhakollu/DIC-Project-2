it wa the first blood weekend of the     college basketball season  a weekend where five of the top   team in the country tasted defeat  three more ranked team were handed l  and the sport s two highest profile matchup both lived up to the hype   <BRK> let s get to the   main thing you need to know about the weekend that wa in college hoop  <BRK> the     indiana hoosier could share a celebratory champagne toast if they wanted to  or if bob knight would return their call  after saturday  the hoosier are guaranteed to be college basketball s most recent undefeated national champion for at least another year   <BRK> no    michigan kicked saturday off with a     loss to the team that ha become john beilein s kryptonite  wisconsin  the loss wa the wolverine  first in   game this season  the best start in program history  it also marked the program s first regular season loss since feb        michigan s only defeat between then and saturday  to villanova in last year s national title game   <BRK> about six hour after the final horn sounded in madison  virginia also saw it perfect season come to an end  the cavalier came up just short in the game of the weekend  falling     at no    duke  more on that in a bit   <BRK> this is actually the second straight season where the country s last remaining unbeaten team have lost on the same day  last season it wa actually three team all tasting defeat on the first day  on dec        villanova lost to butler and tcu fell to oklahoma  those defeat coming a few hour before arizona state  technically the last remaining unbeaten  lost by six to in state rival arizona   <BRK> with no college or professional football being played on a saturday for the first time in     the showcase came between duke and virginia likely had a few more eye than it would have had their been more sporting competition  a healthy chunk of those eye were tuning in to see one man in particular  jack salt   <BRK> or zion williamson  definitely one of the two   <BRK> for those flipping to espn to get their first extended fix of the most talked about college basketball player in the world  he did not disappoint  williamson connected on   of his   field goal attempt  scored   point  grabbed nine rebound  and treated the world to one of his most impressive highlight of       <BRK> this exchange from zion williamson  my word  grab and go rebound  ditch jerome with an in and out crossover at top speed  to the finish over a   footer with his off hand  wow  pic twitter com ojzyn r c <BRK> if you ve been unhappy about the attention williamson ha received up to this point  i ve got some news you might want to lie down for   <BRK> in the post super bowl world  where many sport fan start really paying attention to college basketball for the first time  zion is going to receive even more attention  forget player  team  coach  whatever  williamson is going to be the most talked about thing throughout the buildup to the ncaa tournament and throughout march madness itself   <BRK> so set your advanced muting option on twitter right now or do whatever you need to do  because it s going to get worse  and it should  we ve never seen a freak show quite like this in college basketball  and we might not ever see it again  the fact that he s playing for the highest profile program in the sport and alongside two freshman who could very well join him in the top five of the nba draft in a few month doesn t hurt matter either   <BRK> kansa is suddenly without a reliable big man  it freshman guard aren t maturing the way bill self wa hoping they would  they re getting next to nothing from their bench  and they just lost to a west virginia team that entered the weekend     in conference play and     overall   <BRK> the logical jumping point from all of this is onto a note explaining that ku s run of   straight big   regular season title is about to come to an end   <BRK> there s a problem with that  for the streak to end  at least one team ha to be able to reach out and grab the gift kansa is holding in it extended hand  <BRK> texas tech  which entered last week     in the big   and no    in the ap poll  just lost at home to iowa state and then on the road to an average baylor team  that iowa state team arrived in lubbock coming off back to back league loss  kansa state wa wildly underwhelming in non conference play  and bean it league run with two straight loss  but ha since reeled off four consecutive win   <BRK> the result of all this is four team tied atop the league standing with     conference record  and another  baylor  a half game behind the quartet at       <BRK> kansa ha a significant number of issue at the moment  none of those issue involve a rock solid conference mate who appears poised to steal their crown even if ku get it other affair in order    <BRK> two saturday ago  florida state appeared to be headed for the top of the college hoop world  the  th ranked seminole had outplayed duke all afternoon and were     second away from their most significant regular season win in who know how long  then  cam reddish got wide open on a baseline out of bound set  buried a game winning three pointer  and broke heart across tallahassee  despite the loss  fsu actually moved up two spot to no    in last week s ap poll   <BRK> leonard hamilton s team may not even be in this week s poll   <BRK> perhaps it wa a hangover from the duke loss  but florida state appeared to be more or le going through the motion during a     loss at pittsburgh monday evening  they then had a full six day to get their mind right and prepare for a bounce back performance at boston college on sunday  instead  fsu allowed the eagle to score   second half point and squandered a   point halftime advantage in an     loss   <BRK> in nine day  florida state went from     second away from a signature win and a top   ranking  to losing to the team that had been the only winless squad in the acc  and suddenly finding itself part of a five way tie for last place in the conference   <BRK> it wa a big week for murray state superstar and soon to be nba millionaire ja morant  <BRK> first  he made national headline and led sportscenter with this dunk in the racer  midweek win over eastern illinois  <BRK> ja morant  mother of god  pic twitter com xhmnnibxyy <BRK> then  in saturday s     win over siu edwardsville  morant did all of the following  <BRK>  scored a career high   point  <BRK>  became the first division i player in two decade to make   free throw without missing  <BRK>  became the first division i player in two decade to post a stat line of   point    assist and five steal in a regulation game   <BRK>  scored or assisted on   of murray state s   point   <BRK> morant now lead the nation in assist  averaging a whopping     dime per game  no one is even within shouting distance of that total   <BRK> oh  and at     ppg  he s also the nation s sixth leading scorer   <BRK> morant and the racer have a big week ahead  facing both of their toughest challenger in the ovc   belmont and jacksonville state   <BRK> again  please let this man play in the ncaa tournament   <BRK> to backtrack a bit on that sub heading  indiana s resume at the moment still ha no terrible loss  a pair of quality win over marquette and louisville  and a respectable net ranking of    that would all be good enough to land the hoosier in the field of   if the tournament started today   <BRK> the issue is where the hoosier are and where their recent performance say they re heading   <BRK> indiana ha lost four straight  three of those loss coming by double digit  their most recent defeat  a     shellacking at the hand of arch rival purdue  directly mirrored a monday loss to nebraka in which iu s opponent appeared to be in firm control of the contest from the opening tip to the final whistle  criticism in the hoosier state continues to ramp up a a team with two of the program s best player in recent memory   one which ha spent almost all of this seaon nationally ranked   suddenly find itself in a dangerous spot   <BRK> the primary issue with indiana is pretty straightforward   <BRK> romeo langford   the program s anointed savior   ha been a good a advertised  averaging     ppg and establishing himself a one of the best finisher in the country  it s not hard to argue that the   mr  baketball in the state of indiana ha been the third best freshman in college baketball so far this seaon  juwan morgan  a expected  ha played at an all big ten level  averaging     point and     rebound   <BRK> after that  ehh     not much   <BRK> the fear with indiana heading into the season wa that the hoosier looked too much like a two man team  the hope wa that at least one member of the supporting cast would evolve into a good  if not great  third option  that hasn t come to close to happening  injury deserve a portion of the blame for that  but far from all of it  on day like saturday where langford struggle and morgan can t dominate the post without resistance  the hoosier simply have no counter   <BRK> there are exception  but more time than not  team basically are who they are by this point in the season   <BRK> at this point in the seaon  indiana is a horrible shooting team with a superstar freshman guard and a reliable senior forward and nothing else of note  unless that change dramatically over the coming week  archie miller s second seaon in bloomington is going to be remembered a a disappointment   <BRK> a week ago  georgia state beat louisiana monroe at the buzzer on this controversial bucket by d marcus simonds   <BRK> don t see how this is not a travel pic twitter com lobcap bf <BRK> adding to insult to injury for ulm were two thing  first  they had also been beaten at the buzzer by georgia southern just two day earlier  second  simonds took to twitter after the game to admit that he both walked and pushed off to secure the game s final two point   <BRK> the sun belt would later suspend the officiating crew that worked the game  which likely offered little solace to louisiana monroe   <BRK> what might have made the warhawks feel better wa what troy did to georgia state on saturday   <BRK> j o r d o n  v a r n a d o g a m e     pic twitter com shnlny ljm <BRK> the loss wa the first in league play for georgia state  which sits tied atop the conference standing with texas state at       <BRK> shout to the fun belt for always living up to it nickname   <BRK> after murry bartow took over a ucla s interim head coach and promptly led the bruin to a     start in pac   play  there wa some early chatter   mostly jokingly  because it would be hilarious   that bartow could wind up being the league s coach of the year  that dream now appears to be falling apart  a ucla ha dropped consecutive game to slip to     in the league   <BRK> the talented bruin  most recent defeat came at the hand of their equally talented but equally disinterested city rival  usc  the trojan snapped a four game skid in the series with an     home victory  both team are now     in the pac    a full two game behind conference leader washington   <BRK> there wa a healthy amount of talk about  corner turning  after kentucky ended a disappointing non conference run with back to back win over north carolina and louisville  the wildcat then promptly followed that turn with another  starting sec play with a surprising     road loss to alabama   <BRK> the cat have since won four straight  their most recent being their most significant  an     road triumph over no    auburn  the win wa the first for a john calipari coached kentucky team on the road against a top   sec opponent   <BRK> there are reaon to believe this second corner turn is worthy of more faith than the first  for starter  ahton hagans ha become the dynamic point guard every successful calipari team ha to have  he s also continuing to establish himself a one of the best  if not the best  on ball defender in the country  tyler herro ha broken out of his early shooting slump to become the reliable and clutch scorer he wa made out to be heading into the year  latly  keldon johnson is playing   with the game against georgia on tuesday a an exception   like the lottery pick he ha to be for this team to be a reliable final four threat   <BRK> there are still some glaring issue with this kentucky team  they don t shoot it well from the outside for long stretch  they re not getting enough from their bench  and their two big men are both about     of the player calipari need them to be inside  even so  uk is much closer now to what we thought they were going to be heading into the year than it looked like they were going to be a month ago   <BRK> not the good type of drama either   <BRK> outside of houston s feel good     start  the american is a bit down this year  wichita state is down significantly  uconn ha been a disappointment after a promising start  cincinnati is very good  but not great like a season ago  and preseason favorite ucf wa handed disappointing non con loss by missouri and florida atlantic   <BRK> the most notable thing about the american in     thus far ha been the behavior of it head coach and official   <BRK> first  there wa penny hardaway getting into it with rick barnes  and anyone associated with tennessee basketball  back in december  the  there wa this past week  where four different aac head coach were ejected from game   <BRK> first up wa cincinnati s mick cronin  who wa none too pleased about getting the boot in the middle of his team s eventual     win over south florida   <BRK>  his tough guy buddy threw me out   cronin said of the official in question   what they did  they almost penalized a group of kid and they should be suspended  instead  the league office is monitoring my press conference right now to see if i say anything wrong  that s the problem with our sport   <BRK> cronin lamented that nothing would change a the referee are independent contractor  <BRK>  nothing will happen   cronin said   they just go about their business and they do what they do   <BRK> one night later  uconn s dan hurley and tulsa s frank haith both got the axe under unusual circumstance  after both head coach were assessed a technical for arguing with one another  they appeared to approach each other to shake hand and bury the hatchet  that s when each wa hit with a second technical and forced to watch the remainder of the action from the locker room   <BRK> afterwards  both coach were befuddled   <BRK>  i ve never seen anything like that   hurley said after tulsa s     win   it wa surreal  i would say      watch what happened on tv  it s very clear  i wa talking to the official  and then i wa engaged by someone on the other sideline  they said my name  in my direction  so i turned and looked  with  kind of a look of surprise  <BRK>  i ve known frank for a very long time   probably         year  back to when i wa a high school coach and he recruited my player  i feel a though that situation escalated because of the official and the way they handled the situation   <BRK> haith concurred that the ejection were not warranted and said he considered hurley a friend  <BRK> this lead u to saturday  where wichita state s gregg marshall almost didn t make it through all   minute of the shocker  home loss to cincinnati   <BRK>  i felt like the road team today   wsu coach gregg marshall said  <BRK>     <BRK> whatever stevenson said  referee olandis poole deemed it worthy of a technical  after stevenson relayed to marshall what he said  marshall ripped into poole  then poole s colleague marque pettigrew and finally crew chief pat adam before earning a technical foul himself from adam  <BRK> the snap second decision by marshall resulted in another technical and another two point for cincinnati  but he felt like it wa justified after the game  <BRK>  i felt like at that point  i had to back my player   marshall said   if that s a technical foul in that type of game with all the chit chat going on     <BRK>  i hope the whistle wa better than i thought it wa during the game  when i look at it  i certainly hope it wa better than i think it is right now   <BRK>     <BRK>  you can write about  you can talk about it   marshall answered at the podium when asked about the officiating   unfortunately  i can t  i d like to   <BRK> it should be noted that two of the official involved in the ejection of haith and hurley   marque pettigrew and pat adam   were the two who assessed the technical to marshall on saturday   <BRK> hey  if your league s going to be a bit down in term of overall strength  i m not going to hate on you for finding other way to make it interesting a hell  kudos to the american   <BRK>
