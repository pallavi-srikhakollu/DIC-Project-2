on sunday  the patriot and ram aren t just tasked with shutting down two of the nfl s top offense   they ll also have to figure out how to function in two of the league s loudest stadium  <BRK>kansa city s arrowhead stadium will be rocking despite freezing temperature a the chief host their first afc championship game in franchise history  new orleans  mercedes benz superdome is the perfect echo for crowd noise   and now it s set to host the saint  biggest game since   <BRK>but which team will get the biggest boost on their road to the super bowl from their hometown fan  that s a tough question   especially when you consider how that advantage rattled their sunday opponent in the past <BRK>new orleans cat off a challenge from the ram back in week    giving ram head coach sean mcvay plenty to think about a he plan his return trip to louisiana <BRK> it definitely force you to adjust and adapt and it limit your ability to communicate a lot of thing that you would be able to do otherwise  if you were at home   mcvay said of his upcoming return to the superdome   so  that s definitely something that we have to be aware of <BRK> fortunately  we ve played in this environment earlier in the year  but i would imagine that it s going to be an even better atmosphere just based on the magnitude of the game  <BRK>that s loud  but it s not  jet engine on an aircraft carrier  loud  which is what the patriot faced the last time they were sent to kansa city   a     week   loss back in    from the boston globe <BRK>for the chief  it wa a historic night for a different reason  with a guinness book of world record representative present  the arrowhead crowd crescendoed at an ear splitting     decibel in the second quarter  it wa a world record for stadium noise  breaking the mark of     set in seattle the year before  the crowd s roar even went beyond the decibel level of a jet taking off from an aircraft carrier  which a purdue university study found to be around   decibel <BRK>the patriot have endured plenty of roster turnover since then  but key party like bill belichick  tom brady  james white  julian edelman  rob gronkowski  dont a hightower  and devin mccourty are still with the franchise and will have that memory fresh in their mind sunday <BRK>so if you were taking the field for a playoff game with one of these rabid fanbases behind you  which would you choose <BRK>not only do the chief have a stadium a loud a the deck of an aircraft carrier on their side  they ve also got the weather  sunday night s playoff game won t be the frigid affair that once mystified larry king  but a   degree evening is still an unkind welcome to the city of blue and barbecue   especially if your quarterback happens to be a   year old supernova who owes his longevity to flexibility <BRK>kansa city already played through the cold and snow to greedily chew up the colt  fairy tale ending to the   seaon  proving it can gah opponent on the ground in inclement weather just a efficiently a it doe through the air  it turn out patrick mahomes can crush you with his leg just a eaily a with his arm  which isn t entirely germane to the debate  but is equal part impressive and useful when it s so cold out your   toyota camry refuse to start <BRK>the cold never bothered him anyway     pic twitter com zefsnwbqem<BRK>then you ve got the crowd  which will be absolutely out of it mind on hot chocolate and peppermint schnapps  or irish creme  or cinnamon whiskey  in the biggest postseason game ever played in kansa city  this crowd wa so hyped up to beat the colt last week that fun dad andy reid had to admonish his fan for throwing snowball  you think they re going to get le churlish when the patriot   the team everyone outside of new england hate   come to town <BRK>nope  arrowhead stadium is going to be a  s woodstock ian mess sunday night  the    version if they win  and a le assaulty    version if they don t  everyone there is going to be at least half a mess and it s going to be glorious  the   afc championship game will set the unofficial record for  most mini bottle of fireball swept up after a sporting event   and that s going to make it one of the toughest place for a visiting team to play in nfl history <BRK>drew brees and the saint  offense are just unstoppable at home  this season  the saint only lost one game at home with brees at quarterback   a     loss to the tampa bay buccaneer in the first week of the season <BRK>at home  brees ha throw for   touchdown and just one interception in the seven home game that he played  he s also completed     percent of his pass and averaged     yard per attempt in those home game <BRK>a a tandem  drew brees and sean payton are     in home playoff game <BRK>along with the saint  offense just eviscerating defense at home  the superdome is one of the loudest place to play in the league  this sunday  saint head coach sean payton is aking for saint fan to bring the noise a they play in the nfc championship game against the los angeles ram  <BRK>  seanpayton message to  saint fan for sunday  bring the noise earlier  and louder than normal         homeinthedome pic twitter com wyn dwdrvi<BRK>during the saint  divisional round game against the philadelphia eagle  the superdome got so loud that it even started making the press box start shaking <BRK>they re now playing choppa style and the superdome is rocking  cameron jordan getting down on the sideline  a is demario davis  the press box is shaking <BRK>pairing the saint  home offense with a hellacious home crowd make this not only a tougher place to play than arrowhead stadium  but arguably the toughest place to play in the entire league <BRK>this poll is closed <BRK>
