the atlanta falcon were not playing in either of the conference championship game on sunday  but because the saint were involved  the falcon and their fan were watching a if the dirty bird were playing  when the saint lost to the ram thanks in part to a controversial no call  that only cranked up the pettiness <BRK>this wa the play  a clear a day pas interference by nickell robey coleman on tommylee lewis <BRK>if the saint get that call  they take a few kneel down  kick a field goal  and win      but that s not what happened  and the ram are now going to atlanta for super bowl   <BRK>falcon saint is the best rivalry in the nfl  there s a pinch of bias in there  considering i m an atlanta native and falcon fan  however  it s not some duty rivalry like any of the one in the nfc east that get forced upon u in primetime  the only other modern day  rivalry  i m willing to say come close to this one is raven steelers  those are always fun <BRK>so yeah  when the saint lost a brutal playoff game for the second consecutive year  falcon fan were happy  it wa a little sweeter  because it meant we don t have to worry about the possibility of the saint    coming to atlanta and    winning the super bowl on the falcon  home turf <BRK>with all that said  let s get to the list of falcon fan enjoyed with a petty spirit in the moment after the ram clinched their super bowl berth <BRK>a play so nice  we have to look at it twice   extremely tv broadcaster voice  let s take a look from another angle <BRK>much like stefon diggs  minneapolis miracle  that will be a play that will have saint fan seething for the rest of their life <BRK>that wa definitely pas interference  a shame  really <BRK>there s a first time for everything  and saint fan would tell falcon fan the same after that since vacated super bowl li <BRK>per  espnstatsinfo  since     nfl team that win the toss and receive in ot in the playoff are now     in ot  the only loss wa today by the saint <BRK>robey coleman owned it  that part make it even worse  if you re a saint fan  it s not like robey coleman is even trying to get away with it  and you can argue that he s a lying jackass <BRK>he is openly admitting that the play that cost your team a trip to the super bowl wa indeed bullshit <BRK>he hadn t seen it  so i showed nickell robey coleman the replay of his hit on tommylee lewis   oh  hell yeah   he said   that wa pi   while admitting that  he also gave a fascinating  entirely convincing breakdown of why and how it wa a smart play <BRK>robey coleman wan t even like  ah man  yeah   no  he went with a full on   oh  hell yeah  that wa pi  <BRK>brutal  and hilariously awesome <BRK>let s go to referee bill vinovich  surely he s got an answer for u <BRK>bill vinovich  statement to  amie_just shed basically no light on the controversial no call in  ram  win over  saint  pic twitter com em bdndtp<BRK>vinovich probably should have   i don t know   looked at the play before giving a statement on the play in question <BRK>nah  it s actually better this way <BRK> we were robbed <BRK>this just in  on the pontchartrain causeway    pic twitter com  lnryw b<BRK>the reason that this is so deliciously funny  is that it just further reiterates that you are mad  a lot of football fan around the country are going to understandably feel bad for the saint <BRK>however  when you get to the point where you are taking down highway safety notice or reminder to further display your anger  it make the saltiness even funnier for u falcon fan <BRK>a solid reminder that the saint got their fair share of favorable call in the game a well <BRK> ref cost u the game  pic twitter com sjkqbzdirj<BRK>take it away  governor of louisiana <BRK>heartbreaking loss for the  saint today  but at least the ref can t take away mardi gras   whodat<BRK>i would be interested in the result from a poll of saint fan  asking whether they d give up the traditional mardi gras celebration in   for that pi call <BRK>because if so  there s a christmas eve game from   we should revisit  your friend on the internet jason kirk didn t forget <BRK>thought y all wanted nola rule football pic twitter com zyse qsudd<BRK> hella thinking emojis  mhm <BRK>they did it by tweeting the ram    creation   let s ram it  <BRK>hey  ramsnfl  nice win    pic twitter com q rw xrysh<BRK>you should watch the whole thing  by the way  jackie slater is rippin  the sax at the coliseum <BRK>a locker room video of the ram dancing to  choppa style   that teddy bridgewater helped bring back to life and the saint have been doing  wan t quite a entertaining a a marcus peter press conference whilst consuming gumbo would have been  but it wa still great <BRK>choppa time in the  ramsnfl locker room   via tj_bchillen instagram pic twitter com sb yidblg<BRK>this work <BRK>other than enjoying the hate this video produce  i will refrain from further comment with regard to the content <BRK>when the  ramsnfl hit the game winner and you did not want the saint playing for super bowl in your city   atlantafalcons pic twitter com oylzimz hh<BRK>your effort are appreciated  todd <BRK>his contact wa almost a impressive a robey coleman s on lewis <BRK>man     pic twitter com seqixs slp<BRK>almost <BRK>somebody created this phenomenal piece of art  and todd gurley finished the drill by posting it on his instagram with three skull emojis  and four laughing emojis <BRK>  <BRK>a post shared by  todd gurley   tg hunnid  on jan      at    pm pst<BRK>the post and emojis by gurley were the garnish on what wa already a wonderfully petty dish created by somebody else <BRK>mcvay   the one thing i respect about the ref today is they let the guy play  <BRK>lol  they sure did <BRK>sean payton on the loss   we ll probably never get over it  <BRK>he s right   because falcon fan will never let them <BRK>
