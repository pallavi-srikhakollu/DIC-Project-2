earlier this week  i made a few prediction about what i think will happen in the nfl this offseason  how the steelers  drama with antonio brown play out and where le veon bell will sign are obviously two major storyline that we re all watching unfold  but are they the biggest  not necessarily  <BRK>here are what i consider two of the biggest question this offseason <BRK>without being over the top  this is clearly the no    storyline for the   nfl draft and maybe even the offseason  all domino will fall after this pick  <BRK>last season  the cardinal traded up to take josh rosen out of ucla with the  th pick in the draft  his rookie season wa a wreck  but it wan t all his fault  the cardinal had a poor offense and poor offensive scheme  rosen wa asked to make chicken salad from chicken shit  and he didn t  the cardinal fired their coaching staff and hired an offensive mind in kliff kingsbury  <BRK>kingsbury is thought of a traditional air raid offensive scheme coach  but we ve seen him move more toward a hybrid air raid  almost  but not really   close to how lincoln riley at oklahoma ha morphed his offense  riley and kingsbury use the quarterback a a multi purpose weapon  a player who can threaten a defense with his leg while still throwing the ball enough to satisfy a heavy pasing offense  that s not rosen  <BRK>no matter how often the general manager  president owner  and or kingsbury say rosen is their guy for the future  i don t believe it  here s what i think will happen <BRK>so why kyler murray at no     kingsbury heaped praise on murray during a game week when his texas tech squad wa playing oklahoma last season  compliment are given to opponent during those game week  but this comment wa above and beyond the usual praise  there s clearly an appreciation there  and kingsbury ha imagined his offense with murray  <BRK>well  now his team can draft that player   which i believe the cardinal will do   a he fit what kingsbury want in a quarterback  <BRK>in this scenario  he s not the starter anymore and the cardinal have multiple option on how they go about moving rosen to a backup role or getting rid of him  <BRK>   keep him on the roster a the backup  with the rookie wage scale  this option isn t terrible  rosen s cap number for   is slightly under    million  which is a decent number for a backup quarterback  he d be able to learn under kingsbury and be ready if murray wan t able to start week   or for injury  <BRK>fair or unfair  there wa a stigma out of college that rosen wa tough to work with  and this option could be rough in the quarterback room if rosen doesn t handle it like a professional  <BRK>   release rosen  this option is extremely unlikely  if the cardinal released rosen they d have nearly      million in dead money on the book  according to over the cap  i can t see this option being a viable one <BRK>   trade rosen  this option is clearly the one the cardinal will pursue  a trade of rosen would produce an    million cap hit  but the cardinal would get something back for rosen  <BRK>people are already thinking rosen is a bust  however  rosen s rookie season wa similar to jared goff s disaster of a rookie season and i think in the right system  rosen would flourish  <BRK>i ve always been  higher  on rosen than most  there are team who believe in rosen like i do  but their price tag might be something that would be embarrasing for the cardinal  the cardinal are highly unlikely to receive a first round pick for rosen unless the new england patriot think rosen can be the next tom brady  that would be the  nd pick  would the cardinal accept a mid second round pick  or even a package that included a third rounder a the highest pick  yikes  it would be an awful transaction for the cardinal  <BRK>the  th pick in   go for something far le in    but when you draft a quarterback at   without the infrastructure to help him succeed and then fire everyone  that s on you  could the cardinal get bailed out with a future first rounder  i guess  but that s hard to predict  <BRK>i sure hope not  jay glazer  maybe the most connected medium member in the nfl  wa asked during a q a for the athletic for a bold offseason prediction  he answered with the giant trading odell beckham jr   for glazer to even suggest that mean there s been aggressive talk about moving obj in the past  or even now  then  new nbc sport analyst chris simms shared that new england wa heavily pursuing beckham before the start of the   season  <BRK>

  <BRK>if y all have read me for a while  you know that i don t value high paid running back and wide receiver like most  i don t think you need one to win a super bowl  and i ve been proven right year after year  that being said  if you have the major part of your team set  adding  or giving an extension to a game changer at either of those position is totally fine with me  i d normally be in a favor of a team trading a player like beckham for multiple high level draft pick  <BRK>however  this case is special  odell is a special player  we can point to example where he s won the game for the giant    against dallas and the raven  for example  short slant  long run  ball game  he s beloved in the locker room for his personality  work ethic  and drive to win  it would a disaster for the giant if beckham leaf  <BRK>if the giant keep eli manning for one more season  or draft dwayne haskins at no     they will need a player like beckham to help those quarterback  i just can t see the benefit for the giant in trading him <BRK>
