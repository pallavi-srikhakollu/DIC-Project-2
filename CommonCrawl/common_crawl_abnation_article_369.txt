start following the wnba  <BRK> kevin garnett  i first fell in love with the woman s game with dawn staley  she wa my inspiration  i wa infatuated with the point guard position  i always wanted to try and become the first     point guard  she wa my first inspiration when it came to woman s basketball  and i used to wear my rubber band around my head like her  that s where it started  <BRK> sb  how wa catching up with sue bird in denver  <BRK> garnett  it wa a day in the life  i wanted to piggyback her and see what a day in the life with her wa like  when i first heard she got the position  i reached out to the producer and i said  ayo  sue bird just got a player personnel position in denver  can we ask if we can follow her around to kind of see her day in the life of a new position    <BRK> once i started talking with her  it wasn t jut one particular position  it had multiple within it  from scouting to assessment to intangible  being a point guard  she s been able to pick up on a lot of thing  so she let u piggyback and have access to the court and see the player and workout and her perspective  <BRK> i feel like opportunity when thing align like this have to be celebrated  it ha to be shouted  she s dope people  she s cool people  we ve done olympics  she s always been a   it s nice i can be able to do something like this for a friend  for someone cool like her  <BRK> sb  did you talk to any nugget player about what they ve learned from bird  <BRK> garnett  i didn t get into the in depth of that  i asked guy how they felt about sue being in there  it wasn t even about having a woman in there  just having sue in there   <BRK> all of u are fan  and that s the first thing you have to realize  everyone wa a fan of sue bird and it wa dope to have her around  good energy around that  ya know  <BRK> sb  what should young player pick up about sue bird s game  <BRK> garnett  sue is patient  she s not the fastest  but she s very patient  most point guard who are very good have a rhythm to them  and she is our female version of magic johnson or  allen iverson  and  stephen curry   having the handle  the perception  the perspective  her knowledge  she s done it at all level  in college  the olympics  the wnba  there s no better fairytale than hers  she s battled through injury   <BRK> come on man  she s dope  she s proven  bro  and she s little a shit  man  she s little a shit  you gotta have a presence  that s nothing eay   <BRK> the point guard position is the hardest because you have to demand everybody to do what they re supposed to do on top of whatever you re doing  natural leader  she s fit for the position  <BRK> sb  to you  why is it important that nba team hire wnba player to put in front office and coaching role  <BRK> garnett  i think it go both way  the wnba should take on men a we re taking on woman in position  it help it all  i think the nba need to invest more into the wnba  it d be nice to see them on a shinier stage  a shinier plateau   <BRK> if i wa the wnba  i d be more aggressive towards sponsorship  if you can t get those dollar  i d be aggressive and try and grab dollar where the partnership fit and think outside the box and be innovative about the whole thing   <BRK> there s no better game than the wnba  and i love celebrating it  it s baketball at the end of the day to me  i don t see it a gender   <BRK> sb  what made you decide to bring wnba player on area    <BRK> garnett  the game of basketball ha to be celebrated from both side  you can t just tell one side of the story  i don t think the wnba get celebrated on the level that it should be  so i try to tell both side  highlight both side  give the woman their due  if the woman have something exciting i m always trying to highlight it or repeat it   <BRK> in order to progress  we a a league have to do our part  this is a big ol  fraternity and a family  and it s baketball at the end of the day  you know  at the end of the day  i m always trying to motivate people to be better and give opportunity  this is my chance  i have a platform  i m able to highlight thing i think are interesting and cool  and show their perspective  <BRK> sb  do you feel like what you re doing is breaking open people s mind to watching the wnba  everyone in the nba and wnba are such fan of each other  but the fan sometimes miss that   <BRK> garnett  i don t think it translates into television  or translates into view  you see some of these highlight with the young girl in high school and college coming into the wnba  man  these girl are catching oops  the line ha been pushed a we speak  we re in the midst of transition  at some point  the momentum ha to go this way  and i feel like i m ahead of it  <BRK>   stanfordwbb commit fran belibi slamming down alley oops now    pic twitter com xg tfks e <BRK> at the end of the day it s basketball to me  it s all basketball  you re learning from it whether a man is doing it or a woman is doing it   <BRK> sb  what wa your relationship with candace parker before you brought her on the show  <BRK> garnett  candace  that s the little homie  we ve always had cool energy  she s always had an opinion when it came to basketball and when it came to certain move  i respect her a lot in what she s accomplished  but more importantly  her mind and how she see it  she see the game alike  and when we talk basketball  it s king and queen shit  i can t describe it no other way   <BRK> we re on that level where we just go back and forth on how we would guard something  defense  offense  strategy  passing  moving without the ball  she definitely ha a high iq for basketball  i love talking basketball with her  <BRK> sb  did you see her potential a a broadcater before  <BRK> garnett  it didn t surprise me at all  this job we re doing is nothing but what we ve been taught our whole basketball career  we re able to articulate and have a fanbase  and from that articulation  we re telling perspective  we re letting you in the mind of great offensive player  great defensive player  and what made them great  that s one of the dope thing about listening to her  she let you in for a little bit inside her mind on how she saw the offense and how she saw the defense  and she countered with this   <BRK> the dopest joint wa when she hit steve smith with the shimmy fade in heel  it don t get no hotter than that yo   <BRK> weak contest from steve smith on the candace parker fadeaway pic twitter com sejn oevi  <BRK> sb  how do you think the lynx come back and compete for a title this year  <BRK> garnett  we re going into a new era  and this is the first process of that  i think there s going to be more change  for them to get back to championship caliber basketball  you re going to have to make some change   <BRK> the first part is identifying and growing with whoever the young point guard is going to be and the young nucleus  mixing the young generation and old generation to carry this tradition  they ve built a tradition there  the lynx  they have a formula that work   <BRK> it s about transitioning position and getting that synergy  they have a formula and i look for them to fill in those key piece and get back to what they know   and that s winning  <BRK> sb  i guess any team with maya moore can figure thing out  <BRK> garnett  that s what i m trying to tell you  we got the cream of the cream  ya feel me  we got bucket  she s bucket  that s bucket for day  you understand  however you want it  <BRK>  <BRK> sb  what do you think about ryan saunders  early tenure with the timberwolves replacing tom thibodeau   <BRK> garnett  i wa excited he finally got an opportunity  i know his pop would be super proud  i know a lot of his determination and a lot of his will is wanting to be better than his dad and have his own mark in this league  it s very hard to get a head coaching position  <BRK> at the same time it s unfortunate for thibs  thibs is a really good coach  the new era is going to contest a lot of the coach who are kind of yesteryear into making a transition  but he s a good coach and i see him landing on his foot  i don t see him having a problem being back in the league  <BRK> but i m glad ryno got a chance  he s doing a great job  he s vibrant  he s young  he understands this era of basketball  and i see him making adjustment when he ha to  he s not one of these know it alls  he s always been a person trying to be better and learn more  i look for big thing coming from ryno and the wolf  <BRK> sb  what doe karl anthony town have to do to lead this team to the playoff now that jimmy butler is gone  <BRK> garnett  consistency  consistency make u better or le than the one who came before u   <BRK> i ve told him to focus on hooping and playing versus chatting and talking  kat like to let you know a lot  he s very confident  but man  continue to work  you never want to get in a position where you feel like you don t have to work anymore  i m always telling him to continue to work and be better   <BRK> listen  they re underachieving and they know that  they re a better team than what their record show  and they have to be more consistent at the end of the day   <BRK>
