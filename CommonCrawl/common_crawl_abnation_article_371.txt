two month ago  in one of my first column here  i opined that ousmane dembele had to shape up or be shipped out  <BRK> reading over the piece again  it s clear that i wa fairly scathing of his attitude at that time  <BRK> well  i m holding my hand up  because it look like i wa wrong about him  <BRK> or at least  i can look back now and know that all of the thing which were stopping dembele from fulfilling his obvious potential are no longer talking point  <BRK> with his goal against levante on thursday night  the frenchman ha become the only barcelona player to have scored in every competition this season  <BRK>      dembouz is the first  fcbarcelona player to score in four different competition this season  spanish supercup  liga   championsleague   copa del rey  performance pic twitter com jiim fnwrx <BRK> and  importantly  he s started to become the difference maker that everyone hoped he could be  <BRK> there s been a sea change in attitude too  gone is the lackadaisical   can t be bothered  way of being  and in it place is a driven and focussed wide man  no more rumour of lateness to training either  <BRK> he s thriving on the responsibility of wanting to be involved  and woe betide any full back that let him put on the afterburner in a one on one   <BRK> in short  it s a joy to watch him fully express himself now  and it s no wonder that the camp nou rose a one to acclaim him when ernesto valverde decided it wa time to hook him late in the game against levante  <BRK> prior to his substitution  he d enjoyed a wonderful evening s work  <BRK> ousmane dembélé v levante   minute  goal  pas   pas accuracy   dribble won  key pas  tackle won  interception  duel wonhe ha outplayed leo messi  how often do you see that  incredible performance  what a player     pic twitter com m olvlgxlp <BRK> the green shoot of a great relationship with messi continue to develop  and there s no longer a reticence from his team mate to give him the ball  <BRK> credit ha to be given to valverde too   <BRK> when all around   including this writer       were suggesting that dembele just wasn t worth the hassle any longer  the coach dug his heel in and insisted that the frenchman remained part of his plan  <BRK> for whatever reason when a player is struggling  the importance of getting that kind of backing can t be downplayed and surely helped in getting the player to turn the corner  <BRK> goal     of them now in       will have helped dembele s confidence no end  and he now ha genuine claim to be one of the first name on the team sheet each week   <BRK> could we really have foreseen that back in the earlier part of the campaign  <BRK> ousmane dembélé this season    game    goal    assist  directly involved in a goal every   minutescrack     <BRK> whether or not barca are allowed to continue in the copa del rey this season is a moot point  because dembele s skill set will be needed in the champion league and at the business end of the la liga campaign in any event  <BRK> the kid s making a real name for himself now    and i for one am happy to eat some humble pie  <BRK>
