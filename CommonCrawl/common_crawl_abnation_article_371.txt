we re two month into a golf year that s been noteworthy for many reason  few of them having to do with golf shot  it s been a traveling circus of bad behavior and mistake and controversy  tiger wood hit a golf shot at the wgc mexico championship late in his second round on friday evening  the high from it will not last more than   hour  but it wa nice to marvel at an actual golf shot for little bit and have that be the biggest story of the day  <BRK>the shot is a piece of art  worth celebrating on it own for eternity  here are   thought about a   iron from   yard <BRK>   this is  vintage tiger   a term that s been thrown around haphazardly in the last year  because it ha it all  there s the aggression and gumption to even try it  there is the artistry to conceive it  there is the mind to calculate how to do it best  and the obvious talent to pull it all off  this is the full package reminiscent of his peak power and illustrative of the greatest golfing specimen the world ha ever seen  <BRK> what a swing  what a shot   unbelievable   tigerwoods    liveunderpar<BRK>a post shared by  pga tour   pgatour  on feb      at    pm pst<BRK>   you are not supposed to be able to bend the ball that much from that close in range  every pro can shape the ball in a variety of way  the big banana cut happen with room and space  not from this distance and angle and rarely from the sand  this wa from just   yard  from the sand  behind a tree  and he got it up and out and able to curve that much in that short amount of distance <BRK>   tiger s greatest shot come from the most precarious position  and many of those spot have been in the sand  there s the shot from the fairway bunker at hazeltine  which he ha gone on record to call the greatest of his career  there s the shot from the fairway bunker over water at glen abbey  and now this from the fairway bunker in mexico <BRK>this is not an original point and far smarter golf mind have made it in recent year but  this shot is another reminder in an era obsessed with distance and exclamatory shout about speed and power that the best highlight are never the latest   yard drive  power may be a important a it ever been  but the best highlight come from the fairway or around the green  the spot that remind you it can still be a game of skill and art and touch  <BRK>tiger is the greatest of all time in that area and here  at   year old  wa another demonstration  how many of these career highlight are the booming   yard drive  a my podcat co host andy johnson often say  the greatest shot in the history of golf  the one seared into our memory  are not tee shot <BRK>   i m not sure if the shot is best appreciated through video  with the ball dramatically darting across the green  or in still image  because the photo were a engrossing a the live action <BRK>i will take a slight diversion and say that golf produce the best photograph of any sport  i will hear argument for the nba   this is an incredible image but it s one of dozen that i know i ll be able to instantly recall just from the lat five year alone  between the setting and the character  the photo and photographer out there chaing are a good a it get in sport  <BRK>   the finish  this is an obvious one and close tiger watcher  especially here late in his career  have become familiar with the maaaaaaybe sometimes slightly exaggerated finish on a shot that he need to dig out of the rough or shape in one extreme direction  the image of this finish should be the new pga tour logo  <BRK>   the easiest thing to do in sport analysis is to say it used to be better or more challenging in the past  not to go all  in my day i walked uphill both way to school  but this kind of shotmaking may be lost  or at least endangered  in the new generation of pure power and trackman data fed automaton  you ll hear story about tiger teaching the next generation how to control the ball in way they d never even conceived  and then show them how to hit shot that seem like they re out of a video game  these aren t some scrub at a clinic   they re the best player in the world and at the very top of the ranking  <BRK>i want to believe there s no one under   playing the game right now that would attempt this and execute this and only a few who even understand how it work  maybe jordan spieth  and i m not sure how many there are over   who would even try it or understand it  i m probably being too dismissive of all the other incredible talent  but like i said  it s what i want to believe dammit <BRK>   two day ago  tiger said during his pre tournament press conference that  the ball just doen t curve at this altitude   it curved pretty well here  so maybe this thing would have been an even more extreme bender had we been at sea level  a golf channel s brandel chamblee pointed out  however  it doe still spin at altitude and this wgc mexico had the highest spin rate of any event on tour lat year  that certainly helped once the ball got on the ground and decided to race over toward the pin <BRK>   it is a pleasant shot of dopamine to watch tiger be happy to talk about the shot and what went into it  he is always at his most valuable and insightful when he get in the weed on golf  from shotmaking to style to course setup  also  here we get the term  duck slice  <BRK> to slice a   iron like that wa pretty good    tigerwoods give golftv the breakdown of his  miraculous  final hole bunker shot in friday s locker room lowdown  pic twitter com subxrfuobu<BRK>   i do not care that he missed the putt  although he seemed pretty pissed about it  it doe not matter  the shot is the shot in a vacuum and talking about the putt is like nitpicking about some potential travel call before a legendary in game dunk  phil mickelson s shot from the pine straw at augusta wa not diminished by the missed putt and neither is this  <BRK>   i wrote this approximately   time last year during that incredible comeback season  but the fact that this highlight exists after the prior five year is still staggering  and  whatever you think of tiger personally  it s a gift  it s a gift to watch the greatest golf mind and creative talent execute this kind of shotmaking when it seemed almost certain that he would never play on the pga tour again  it s permissible to get a little saccharine and cherish it <BRK>
