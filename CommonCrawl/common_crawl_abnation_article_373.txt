every player that make it to the super bowl is important  some are just much  much more important than others  <BRK> both the ram and patriot live and die by their quarterback  for new england  a sixth nfl championship rest on the   year old shoulder of tom brady  who is making his ninth super bowl appearance and working for his fifth super bowl mvp award  <BRK> tom brady ha     passing yard in the super bowl   just  the super bowl that s more than   other no longer active first round quarterback had in their entire nfl career  including tim tebowtodd marinovichjohnny manzielakili smithandre warejim druckenmiller <BRK> on the opposite sideline will be a   year old passer making his fourth postseason start  jared goff wa the first man selected at the   nfl draft  and he s rewarded the ram  faith by developing into one of the league s top passer  now he ll step onto the biggest stage of his football career and attempt to keep the patriot from their familiar throne   <BRK> but while these two quarterback will be super bowl   s headliner  they can t will their team to ultimate victory on their own  both new england and los angeles will be relying on star studded supporting cast   but the most important player on the field might not be the pro bowler and all pro you expect  <BRK> consider whitworth the representative of his entire offensive line  the veteran left tackle had a typically solid season in    leading a unit that only allowed quarterback jared goff to be sacked   time during the regular season  los angeles      percent sack allowed rate ranked sixth in the nfl last fall  <BRK> he ll have his hand full against an aggressive new england pa rush that threw patrick mahomes off his game early in the afc championship game  the pat sacked mahomes three time in the first half alone  accounting in    net yard a the chief went scoreless in the first two quarter  one week earlier  they sacked phillip river twice and hit him seven more time in a divisional round rout  <BRK> peter lead a heady group of defensive back that also includes former all pro aqib talib  nfc title game cheater nickell robey coleman  and nfc title game interception haver john johnson  <BRK>   iamjohnthethird interception confirmed     pic twitter com dtilfv eq  <BRK> that s a rich vein of defender who will be tasked with shutting down tom brady  a man with   pasing yard in two playoff game so far  that group  led by the boom or bust peter  helped hold drew brees to just     yard per pas sunday  turning him into short brock osweiler in the process  now they re tasked with shutting down another future hall of famer in the biggest game of the season  <BRK> that mean peter and his crew will have to shut down    <BRK> new england s lack of target wa a legitimate concern entering the postseaon  but gronkowski and edelman have proven to be a clutch a their quarterback after showing up in a masive way in the afc title game  the pat  wr te duo combined for six catch and   yard   including three incredibly important third down conversion   on the three drive that gave new england the lead late in the fourth quarter or in overtime  <BRK> the patriot have worked hard to establish their running game early on  using sony michel  james white  and a litany of short pass to lure opposing safety toward the line of scrimmage and jump start their play action passing game  gronk and edelman may not have an immediate impact in super bowl    but they ll be ready when brady need them the most on a stage they re intimately familiar with  <BRK> the best way to ground tom brady s pasing attack in the super bowl is to drive him into the ground repeatedly  that s the blueprint the giant followed to earn a pair of lombardi trophy in famous upset  that s what ram  defensive coordinator wade phillips will attempt to recreate february   behind a dominant defensive line led by streaking comet of pas rushing rage aaron donald  <BRK> mason  pro football focus s top rated guard  is the keystone to one of the league s most powerful offensive line  new england hasn t given up a sack this postseason thanks in part to a dominant showing from the team s interior blocker   mason  center david andrew  and right guard joe thuney  that group will be counted on to shut down a defensive line that only ranked  th in the league in sack rate  but still came up big when it came to making drew brees uncomfortable in the pocket  sacking him twice and hitting him seven more time in an nfc title game victory  <BRK> stephon gilmore will earn the assignment covering the ram  top receiving threat   either brandin cook or robert wood  depending on defensive coordinator brian flores  strategizing  jason mccourty  resurgent after fleeing cleveland  will probably handle whoever gilmore doesn t cover  <BRK> that leaf jackson  an undrafted free agent rookie cornerback  to cover josh reynolds and whomever else the ram throw at him  reynolds ha emerged a a playmaking third option for la s high powered attack  averaging just under   yard per game in his lat eight appearance but averaging a devatating     yard per catch  he had five touch for   yard to wear down the saint in the nfc title game  exploiting whatever tiny hole the new orleans secondary allowed  <BRK> the chief picked on jackson sunday  drawing a pair of pas interference call and a defensive holding penalty against the first year player  sean mcvay is going to do the same  but jackson exceeded expectation in    and new england ha a history of getting impressive performance from undrafted free agent rookie cornerback in the super bowl  <BRK> no one know what the hell happened to gurley in the nfc title game  the   and   first team all pro earned only one more carry than his team s wide receiver  botched asignment a a pas blocker  and made a pair of catatrophic drop on third down that ended one scoring drive and granted the saint one of their own  <BRK> gurley told josina anderson after the game that he wasn t hurt  just having the worst week of his nfl career at a terrible time  that mean he should be good to go for the super bowl  where he ll attempt to reclaim the early postseason glory that s accompanied his rise to fantasy draft across the world  the fourth year tailback s first two playoff game saw him explode for    rushing yard in each of them  if c j  anderson ha another back to earth     yard per carry performance against new england  the ram are going to need their all world starting running back to cover that deficit and provide the potent counterpunch to jared goff s passing attack  <BRK> donald  who will almost certainly be   s defensive player of the year  ha been better than almost anyone realizes   <BRK> he s also had a quiet postseason  the pocket crumpling defensive lineman ha been held without a sack for the past two game   only his third sack le streak to stretch into multiple game since november     but he s still made his presence felt in the playoff  on sunday  he wa part of a fierce pas rush forced drew brees into an inefficient performance and  most importantly  a game changing interception in overtime  <BRK> he ll take on the playoff  top offensive line at super bowl    the patriot have been superlative when it come to protecting their   year old paser so far  keeping stalwart like joey bosa  dee ford  chris jones  and justin houston without so much a a qb hit in the postseaon   <BRK> goff fulfilled his potential a   s no    overall pick this fall  going from  mediocre  to  good  to  great  and emerging a a bonafide mvp candidate in his third seaon a a pro  a late seaon slump kept him from making a real run at an award that s almost certainly going to be patrick mahomes   but it doesn t make his rise from  potential bust  to  franchise quarterback  any le impressive  <BRK> goff ranked fourth in the league in paing yard  fourth in yard per pa        and third among all quarterback with four fourth quarter comeback   and that doesn t count his rally at the nfc title game  where he overcame an early     deficit and led his team   yard a time wound down to kick an equalizing field goal that sent the game into overtime  <BRK> he wasn t especially efficient in the clutch   he completed only six of his final   pass   but he made those strike count  earning first down on three of those completion  but after throwing for    yard eight time in the regular season  he s yet to hit that mark in any postseason  in fact  after recording a     passer rating this past two season  his playoff rating is just      in big game  he s gone from an mvp candidate to blake bortles  <BRK> the good news is bortles wa able to give the pat a scare in last year s afc title game  the bad news is  you know     <BRK> blake bortles  <BRK> like it could be anyone else   <BRK> any doubt about brady s regression from great in   and   to just  pretty good  in   were erased when he led three different fourth quarter drive to take the lead against the chief in a hostile arrowhead stadium  and now he s back in the super bowl  where he s thrown for   yard per game and hold a     passer rating  <BRK> eight previous super bowl have lived and died on the throw of tom brady  super bowl   won t be any different  <BRK>
