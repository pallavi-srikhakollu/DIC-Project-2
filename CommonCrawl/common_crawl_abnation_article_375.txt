last week  i highlighted a shift that s taken place in the yankee  farm system  it s loaded with pitching  perhaps not close to the major  high probability pitching prospect  but pitching nonetheless  after churning out a number of premier hitting prospect  like gleyber torres  gary sanchez  and aaron judge  the current yankee  system is dominated by young  hard throwing  right handed hurler <BRK>this might appear concerning to some  a i mentioned in that piece  tinstaapp  there is no such thing a a pitching prospect  is a pervaive  and not unconvincing  idea  pitching prospect profile a inherently volatile  and far riskier than their hitting counterpart  in the likeliest scenario  most of the yankee  flamethrowing prospect bust <BRK>on the other hand  the yankee might just beat tinstaapp by sheer brute force  the overwhelming number of interesting  live armed right handers populating the system raise a legitimate possibility  that the yankee have an ace lurking in the minor right now  but we just don t know who it is yet <BRK>think about it  sure  no single prospect in the yankee  system rank among the game s elite  none of them have even better than coin flip odds at becoming established major leaguers  there s no forrest whitley  or sixto sanchez  or casey mize  instead  there s such a large number of player with a slim shot at putting it all together that chance are  one will <BRK>scan any of the public s top ranking of the yankee  farmhand  whether it s fangraphs  baseball propsectus  or mlb pipeline  and grab a name  or five  perhaps it s deivi garcia  the undersized   year old with a hard fastball with an elite spin rate  and a curveball that s already plus  maybe you choose jonathan loaisiga  who might actually start the year in the major  and showed last year that his overpowering stuff can get hitter out right now <BRK>it could be roansy contrera  a teenager whose stuff fangraphs described a  a luis severino starter kit   and whose makeup draw raf from the yankee  how about luis gil  this   year old right hander ha bumped his velocity up from the lower  s to the upper  s with the yankee  even touching a high a   mph  or else luis medina is more your speed  another right hander that ha  you guessed it  touched   mph <BRK>i could go on for age with these live armed prospect with eye popping velocity and wipeout breaking ball  i ll spare you the full list  if only because there s only so many way to describe a right hander that flah triple digit and a knee buckling slider before you begin to repeat yourself  this doesn t even bring up the pitchability type  such a michael king and garrett whitlock  who may not have the overbearing velocity of some of the other prospect but have excelled in the yankee  system nonetheless  <BRK>in all  the yankee have well over a dozen pitching prospect that all appear unlikely to make it a productive big leaguers  but have a shot  many will fall short  they either will get injured  or fail to refine their command enough to play anything more than a middle relief role  or struggle to find a third pitch  or prove unable to hold up to the rigor of the long mlb seaon  <BRK>but one or two might make it  if  for simplicity s sake  each one of these low level prospect ha  say  a tiny seven percent chance at becoming a front line starter  then the yankee actually have a strong shot at converting one of them into an ace  the odds that every single one of these arm fails just aren t all that high <BRK>to better visualize the odds  i ve found the estimated fv  future value  probability distribution fangraphs put together to be instructive  their prospect team estimated the chance each player on their top   list fall into different fv bucket  ranging from backup to mvp candidate  <BRK>consider sandy alcantara  a marlin pitcher  and  th prospect on fangraphs  list  alcantara is basically the kind of prospect any one of the yankee  pitcher might become in a year a two  he ha the mid to upper  s fastball and the above average slider  but he s also come across a good changeup and workable command  which he parlayed into an mlb debut last seaosn  here s his estimated fv outcome chart <BRK>a fringe top   guy like alcantara  something any number of yankee prospect might look like come this time next year  probably ha something between a    and   percent shot at turning into an all star or cy young contender  not to mention an equally good chance at becoming a quality role player  in essence  if even a handful of the yankee  legion of young right handers progress somewhat into top   conversation  the odds are solid one turn into something special <BRK>this is all pretty abstract  and treat the player themselves a lottery ticket  each and every one of them is an actual pitcher  an athlete with a story and talent and presumably a strong work ethic to make it even this far  i personally would love to see all of them make good on their dream to make it to the major  <BRK>most of them won t  the yankee are betting that some will  and that enough of them do that maybe  just maybe  one or two really pop  it s hard to bet on any one of them  it might be even harder to bet against all of them <BRK><BRK>
