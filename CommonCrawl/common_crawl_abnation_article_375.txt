the memphis grizzly gave it a good effort  <BRK> after a depressing     that started with a derailing mike conley injury  evolved into a job killing spat between david fizdale and marc gasol  and finished with a month long tank job  the grizzly ran it back with a healthy and bolstered squad in      conley got back on the court  and the front office added jaren jackson jr  from the nba draft  garrett temple via trade  and kyle anderson in free agency   <BRK> it worked for a while  gasol and conley looked rejuvenated in october and november  having filled the court with grime amid a new offensive revolution  memphis wa     and even in first place in the west for a brief moment   <BRK> but it s over now  gasol ha been pretty bad for a month  and memphis doesn t have the juice to keep up in the brutal western conference  that s why the grizzly have put gasol and conley on the trade market  according to report  <BRK>

   <BRK> if even the grizzly realize it s time to move on from gasol and conley  their day in memphis are numbered  gasol s gigante contract expires after the     season unless he opts out of    million  which seems unwise  but given that cap space is at a premium for the   free agency session  the big spaniard might not be tradable until july  once some team with cap space and high expectation strike out   <BRK> conley ha an additional year beyond gasol on his enormous contract  but he s three year younger without the burgeoning reputation for moodiness that gasol carry  could a desperate team like the sun or piston make a play for conley  what would memphis want or expect in exchange for one of the best and most beloved player in franchise history  would it be wiser to wait for the summer and see if whichever team land kevin durant  assuming it s not the warrior  need a point guard  <BRK> and whither bickerstaff  who took over on an interim bais lat seaon  finished the inglorious tank job successfully  and quickly got hired to coach what wa expected internally to be a good team  will the memphis brain trust   whoever that includes these day  a it s tough to keep up with the vicious  volatile internal politics in grizzlyland   trust bickerstaff with an actual rebuild if the team go that way  <BRK> will the team ever go that way  <BRK>

   <BRK> we hear so often that team in small market can t afford to strip it down bare and rebuild   the business model requires butt in seat  and people don t show up for     season  here s the rub  people don t show up for     season either  and that s what memphis is headed for  or worse   the question is not if     is more or le sustainable in a business sense than      it s how you get back to     and a playoff chase  <BRK> you don t do it by tinkering with this team  unfortunately  kyle anderson  jaren jackson  and the shell of the once glorious mike conley and marc gasol aren t going to do it  <BRK> the revised draft lottery odds and the fact that the grizzly owe the celtic their first round pick make decision making around this issue more urgent  memphis must give boston it   pick unless it is in the top eight  up through last season  the grizzly could have basically guaranteed they would keep their selection by finishing with the seventh worst record  and would have had a   in   chance of keeping it by finishing with the eighth worst record   <BRK> but the odds have been smoothed out going into this lottery  which is bad news for memphis  under the new system  memphis would need to finish with the fifth worst record to have a nearly   percent probability of keeping it pick and the sixth worst record to have a   percent probability of keeping it  being the seventh worst team would leave a   percent probability they d lose the pick  being the eighth worst would make it a     proposition  a of jan     memphis is the sixth worst team in the league  <BRK>  all told  being terrible is the best play for memphis now  the grizzly need another blue chipper  and a good shot at a superstar  to build around  if losing conley and gasol help that  so be it   <BRK> where memphis is now  though  is not where it ought to want to be  the only way up is to go down  <BRK> nba news and link delivered to your inbox each weekday  so you never miss out  <BRK>
