a far a position player go  the yankee roster seems pretty much set for    there s a clear cut starter at every position  and the recent addition of dj lemahieu signifies that the bench is just about locked down too  over the pat few seaons  the yankee have shown an affinity for an eight man bullpen with three position player on the bench  meaning there s just one spot left for multiple player <BRK>keeping a greg bird  clint frazier  tyler wade rotation for the third bench spot seems like it might work out best for the yankee in    no doubt  these guy haven t had the most stellar career to this point  between injury  performance issue  or both  they just haven t been a good a initially advertised  but the yankee shouldn t just give up on them  it s not like these guy are expensive  and bird is the eldest of the three at age    the yankee don t need these guy to be all star or to even start  but they each bring something different to the table that help supplement the yankee roster  <BRK>a the proud owner of a greg bird shirsey  it hurt so much to see bird struggle the way he ha the pat two seaons while luke voit stormed onto the scene and rightfully won the starting first bae job  bird just didn t look like a major leaguer lat seaon  he wa getting blown away by   mph fatballs and when he did make contact  it wan t hard  bird s average exit velocity lat seaon put him in the  th percentile of the league  not a good look <BRK>aaron boone speculated last season that while bird wa  healthy   the multiple injury he s had since   had sapped his stamen and strength  a right shoulder surgery and two right ankle surgery isn t insignificant  perhaps with more time removed since his last surgery  bird can get back to being a promising young player  should bird figure thing out in triple a  he could be a valuable piece for the yankee in   <BRK>here s why  we don t know how good luke voit is going to be  the major league data we do have is great  after joining the yankee  he wa a           hitter with a   wrc   but that wa   game  neither albert pujols nor paul goldschmidt have put up a full season that good  so i m not betting voit will  should voit run into some sophomore struggle  the yankee could once again fall back on bird <BRK>i m fully aware that bird s ability to contribute at the major league level is completely contingent on him figuring thing out in triple a  maybe that happens  maybe it doen t  if it doe  bird is there to provide depth at first and give a left handed presence off the bench  something the yankee don t really have in their lineup  this is the first time in a long time the yankee haven t been counting on bird  hopefully  he ll be able to iron out his issue and can contribute off the bench this season <BRK>clint frazier is unlikely to break camp a the starting left fielder next seaon after post concussion symptom kept him sidelined for most of    a trip to triple a to begin the seaon just to knock off the rust seems like the most likely scenario for him  frazier announced yesterday on twitter that he s been fully cleared to participate in spring training though  which mean he should be good to go whenever the yankee need him  <BRK>after a longggggggg battle with the concussion like symptom i m happy to tell u i ve been cleared to participate in spring training and go after what i ve wanted since being traded over here  to win an outfield job and show u guy what i can do  i m readyyyyyyy  pic twitter com qsi lcmmbr<BRK>whenever that call come  frazier would be a perfect candidate for the three man bench rotation  the fact that he s a right handed left fielder mean he d be a pretty great platoon option for brett gardner  who did not fare well against lefty last season  plus  the time spent in triple a mean he d be able to find consistent at bat  which is not something he wa able to do last season  <BRK>the need for bird and frazier is a bit obvious  asuming bird right the ship  he can provide some left handed thump and backup voit when needed  similarly  frazier will be around to give gardy s   year old leg some rest and to hit lefty  tyler wade s inclusion in my hypothetical rotation isn t necessarily a straightforward because dj lemahieu already occupies the utility infielder role  <BRK>wade fit into this rotation because the yankee could benefit from having a second utility infielder  using troy tulowitzki a the everyday shortstop is a real gamble  he played just   game in   and ha only eclipsed   game played in a seaon four time since    he just find a way to get hurt  combine this with the fact that miguel andujar might still be terrible at third bae  and we ve got ourselves a shortage of usable infielder  which is where wade come in <BRK>like bird  wade need some time in triple a to figure out if he can still hit because he hasn t done much of that since his triple a season in    even without the bat  the yankee still might find need of his glove at some point in   <BRK>a lot of fan have seemingly given up on these guy  but there s not really a reaon to  true  they haven t been a good a advertised  but they re still young  cheap  and none of them are currently in a position where the yankee absolutely need them to produce  let them figure thing out in triple a and bring one of them up a the situation call for it  the yankee could use their third bench spot to service a different team need at any given point in the seaon  and who know  by the end of the seaon they might have three guy ready to contribute at the major league level  <BRK>
