well  this is a piece that i did not expect to write this season  the all star break is officially upon islander land with long island s own a surprising leader of the pack in the metropolitan division  yes  you read that correctly  the islander are in first place at the all star break   <BRK> lat week  i did my best to deep dive the islander in a more analytical view that wa not solely baed on self fulfilling perception  since then  the islander have played four game to a    attempt share and    high danger share via natural stat trick  they have given up a total of three goal  plus one more in a shootout loss   i had pegged them a a solidly average team getting a boost by goaltending  their performance since is that of a team much better than average  <BRK> even if the team come back to earth a bit  which they will   the islander have had a long enough run where the mentality ha shifted from  hey maybe this team is good enough to hang around  to  who is this team going to play in the first round   and frankly  that s not without merit  <BRK> the above chart from reagan king s corsisle  which average out some of the key statistical playoff model  show the math is currently working pretty heavily in the isle  favor  and if you have watched the islander  you can see they have created a culture of suffocating defense and opportunistic offense  it show on the ice and in the number  over the last   game  they are  th in score adjusted attempt share         and second in score adjusted high danger chance          <BRK> those are  quite simply  not the result of a team that is over reliant on pdo  while the pdo boost      over their lat    doe exist  it s more important to call out the improvement of the islander  underlying number  a stated  the way to mitigate pdo ebb and flow is to improve shot attempt share  and of late  the islander have succeeded in doing that  <BRK> so  here we are  the islander are good  why wouldn t they be aggressive at the deadline  <BRK> let s dig in  <BRK> last year  i went onto lighthouse contributor garik s videocast making a plea for former gm garth snow to take advantage of the rare case of having two franchise center on the roster  at the time  the islander were well above nhl    and looked to be cruising  they were       at the time  with one of the most potent offense in the league   <BRK> thing fell off the rail  garth snow did nothing  john tavares left in free agency  and thing looked    fairly bleak  <BRK>     <BRK> well  here we are again   except this time it s late january and a division leader  the islander are the surprise of the nhl  this year  they have another unique situation   or a combination of them  this year s edition includes a hall of fame coach  a group of player who continue to play at level above any reaonable expectation  a franchise center still on his entry level contract  one of the best performing goaltending tandem in the league  and a lot of cap space  <BRK> so i m going to say it again  the islander should be adding at the deadline  <BRK> this is not my normal point of view  though it may seem that way after two consecutive year of advertising such a strategy  but my reason is simple  the islander have uncovered a unique set of circumstance that may be difficult to repeat in future year   <BRK> let s think about it   <BRK> okay  this is repeatable  barry trotz is not going anywhere  and no  i don t think anyone think he suck  <BRK> sure this is possible for it to happen again  but is it something you can bank on  probably not  considering the bar is undoubtedly raised going into next season   <BRK> you got one more year of this  then he s going to be expensive  like  really expensive  <BRK> impossible to predict  not only do the islander not have a signed tandem for next season  it s been proven that goaltending is volatile year to year and is not correlated to higher salary  <BRK> here one minute  gone the next if you re not pragmatic about it   this wasn t meant to be a cheap plug  by the way  i think   <BRK>    <BRK> and i get the opposing point of view here  there are always reaon not to go through with something  this situation isn t different  in fact  there s plenty of logic to the notion that the islander are working towards belmont  that they should hold onto their farm of aset a lou lamoriello continues to evaluate  that the team just isn t ready   <BRK> at the same time  gosh  you could have said the same thing in the     season   <BRK>  the islander are working towards brooklyn   <BRK>  the islander should hold onto all of their prospect  including griffin reinhart  michael dal colle  and ryan pulock   <BRK>  the islander just aren t ready to win yet    okay  that one is the same  <BRK> that team  and the subsequent     team  also had a similar set of unique circumstance  the former management regime stayed fairly inactive  and that era of islander hockey came and went with a singular playoff series victory  ala  <BRK>    <BRK> now at this point  i m sure you re asking who the islander could realistically acquire  and i am going to give a total cop out answer here  i don t really know who is available  what they would cost  and what go into facilitating trade in the nhl   <BRK> here s what i will say  the islander could use an upgrade down the middle  they could use upgrade on the third line  they could definitely use another scorer  a goal become at a premium for the playoff and the islander don t really have enough of those pure goal scoring type of player   <BRK> those are just off the cuff observation based on the body of work of this season to date  they may be able to fill one or all of these gap  but i ll leave that to lou lamoriello  <BRK>    <BRK> at the end of the day  thing can change very quickly  we saw it from   into    and again from   into    so below are few key future point to remember  a this perfect storm of circumstance present themselves   <BRK> when mathew barzal s contract expires  thing will change  when the islander leave the coliseum  again   thing will change  when the calendar change to the     season  thing will change  for now  however  an opportunity ha presented itself  <BRK> bottom line  it s time for the islander to take it   <BRK>
