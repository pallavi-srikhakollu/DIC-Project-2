in case you didn t know  the steelers and antonio brown are on the out   <BRK> this ha happened before between the two party the fight  the disagreement  the hurt feeling but the issue were always resolved  however  unlike real life couple who vow to never go to bed angry at one another  the steelers and their star wide receiver have spent many night week  actually not only angry at each other  but engaging in the old silent treatment  at least the star receiver ha  <BRK> brown is incommunicado with his employer at the moment  but  gosh darn it  he s vowed to come out with his side of the story one  of  these  day   <BRK> for their part  the steelers don t seem to be too emotionally distraught over brown s latest reason for giving them the old silent treatment  and it ha been reported that parting way with him via trade is something the organization is seriously considering   <BRK> i get it  i really do  i m getting fed up with brown s antic  too  of course  i never thought these antic would tempt the steelers to get rid of him  a legacy player  someone who is already one of the greatest in team history  but  then again  i don t have to live with brown  i don t have to work with brown  and  perhaps  most importantly  i don t have to reason with brown on a seemingly endless basis   <BRK> the steelers owner  general manager  coach and player must do all of these thing  which is why they may be a willing to part way with brown a your average facebook poster who say  get rid of fire him   without really worrying about the consequence   <BRK> and the consequence of parting way with brown may be huge  sure  you re losing a constant distraction  but you re also losing the greatest receiver in the game  sure  you might bet your jolly off watching a frustrated brown fall to piece on a totally horrible jet team  but would you get your jolly off watching the like of eli rogers and the totally unproven james washington try to replace him  <BRK> this is just a guess but probably not not unless you have a different idea of what getting your jolly off mean   <BRK> they say you can t win with a player like brown  but i don t buy that for a second  a far a i m concerned  there are few player in team history more clutch in big moment than no     and the number of time he s come through with either a big catch or a big touchdown are just too numerous to document in this little article   <BRK> but  again  i don t have to live with brown  i  don t have to deal with a potential volcano erupting in   and doing more damage to the steelers super bowl chance than inserting eli rogers into the lineup ever could   <BRK> so if you have to trade brown  trade him  but  damn it  you better make it right   <BRK> apparently  the  er particularly jerry rice would love to have antonio brown come to their organization and catch pas from handsome jimmy garoppolo  fine  but if i m the steeler  i want san francisco s premium first round draft pick  none of this second round pick business  a my brother tell me in every text involving a potential trade in whatever sport   you gotta give to get    <BRK> damn right  you do   <BRK> a much a you might want to see brown go  the chance of the steelers being better off without him are pretty slim if they don t get fair value in return   <BRK> to sort of give what i said earlier a different twist  you don t have to live with antonio brown  you don t have to work with antonio brown  you don t have to reason with antonio brown   <BRK> and since you insist on putting your entire heart and soul into cheering for the pittsburgh steelers  you probably aren t too eager to see a depleted edition in    therefore  shipping brown off for anything below a first round pick  and even that might be too low if the first round pick belongs to a playoff team  is simply out of the question  <BRK> fortunately  unlike the fan  the steelers aren t in the business of making rash decision  they are  however  in the business of winning   <BRK> and if they don t trade brown away this offseason  they ll still have the service of one of the nfl s best play maker next regular season   <BRK> how will that work after everything that s gone down  it s way too early to know at this point  it s amazing how a heart to heart conversation can really clear  the air and make thing right   <BRK> speaking of making thing right  if the steelers really are thinking of shipping brown off to the highest bidder  well  they damn well better make sure it s the highest bidder   <BRK> i m certainly not in the business of watching inferior steelers football in     <BRK>   <BRK>  <BRK>
