  <BRK>ryan  i will remember it a the start of a new streak of tourney bid <BRK>drew  it wa a good  yet disappointing  season  finishing fourth in the big ten this year is nothing to scoff at <BRK>jake   especially this season <BRK>drew  losing in the first round of the tournament is a disappointment  however  honestly  if you ask me in two year about this season  i bet i ll look back fondly on ethan happ s career and khalil iverson s late season heroic <BRK>ryan  iverson s surge made me wonder where he wa before then <BRK>drew  this wa not a championship team  of any sort   and they punched above their weight in a lot of game but lost to better team  iverson wa too deferential in past year  he threw all that out the window when he knew his career wa winding down <BRK>ryan  at time he wa the best player on the court  wa great to see him turn it on <BRK>jake  and a you mentioned in the b g roat  drew  he hit a three <BRK>

  <BRK>drew  that made me very happy  good for him <BRK>ryan  this season also wa a good look at what the future will bring  trice and reuvers showed a lot of promise <BRK>jake  drew s right where a couple year from now  and looking at the roster  this team will be thought of in much fonder term <BRK>ryan  and i love king assertiveness at time  make me excited to see what he can do <BRK>ryan  i think the offense will open up more      will be able to shoot the three <BRK>drew  the offense  hopefully  won t grind to a halt like it sometimes did when happ touched the ball in the post  there will be more movement on offense and le lane clogging <BRK>jake  two word  micah  potter  i think potter will be an interesting piece of the puzzle <BRK>drew  the defense will be worse and will need to find itself quickly or risk being blown out by team in non conference <BRK>ryan  i love happ  but sometime i felt like he handcuffed the offense  at time they relied far too much on him  and at time  like drew said  we slowed down too much when he wa in the paint <BRK>jake  like you said  drew  the defense will need to find itself  especially with the team s two best defender gone  this will be reuvers  time to shine  and it will be interesting to see the jump between second and third year <BRK>drew  potter ha become sort of an interesting  cure all  for fan looking ahead to next year  there are some who think that simply inserting him  a big that can shoot  into the starting lineup will make the badger a well oiled offensive machine <BRK>ryan  personally  i think reuvers will further his game on defense  at time he wa a great shot blocker and i think it will only begin to get better and consistent <BRK>drew  the badger will have no  go to guy  on offense next year unless someone make an unexpected  kaminsky jump  this offseason  and uw may end up missing happ more than we thought <BRK>ryan  i think trice is close to being that guy <BRK>drew  reuvers being a deterrent at the rim will definitely smooth out some of the rough edge on defense to start but if he get in foul trouble the team could struggle early <BRK>jake  trice ha the leadership quality  and he actually wa passing the ball around nicely if you look at his stat sheet and assist  the big thing will be hitting that consistent jumper again that made him that viable secondary option and the perfect outside complement to happ s inside game earlier in the year <BRK>ryan  his hot start wa quit apparent when you look at how poorly he shot toward the end and he still shot   percent from outside on the year <BRK>jake  he won t shoot   percent all year like he did earlier in the season <BRK>ryan  yeah  hard to keep up that pace <BRK>ryan  kobe king and aleem ford <BRK>drew  kobe king and brad davison  although  ford s willingness to stick his nose in the mix and grab rebound loose ball near the end of the year is something i d like to see continue <BRK>ryan  it seemed to take him a while to get comfortable <BRK>jake  that wa a promising sign from ford <BRK>drew  king need to turn the aggressiveness up a notch next year  i hope he saw iverson hunting his shot at the end of the season and think  i m not going to wait until the end of my senior year to do that   <BRK>ryan  he really doe and you have to think that he will  because more minute have to be opening up for him <BRK>drew  davison should work on moving his foot on defense so he isn t always in these     scenario and getting cheap foul called because the ref don t want to call the charge <BRK>jake  working back from that knee injury  king will have that full season and offseason to continue his development <BRK>ryan  should do him well <BRK>drew  here s hoping  an all conference season out of king  while unlikely  wouldn t be completely unexpected either <BRK>ryan  he s the one guy on the team that i can see being able to create for himself both inside and out <BRK>drew  indeed  he could turn into a  go to guy  <BRK>ryan  here s to hoping <BRK>jake  for me  i think it s reuvers  there need to be an inside presence for wisconsin on both end  happ is gone  reuvers showed he can create his  natereuversblockparty with his block  if he contributes offensively with double digit scoring  then attack the glass more with grabbing rebound  he and potter could offset a lot of lost production with happ and iverson departing <BRK>jake  is it the same person for you all  because i d say king or even ford here <BRK>ryan  kobe  hand down <BRK>drew  much like my undying love for rob wheelwright  i will continue to bang the drum for kobe king until he exhaust his eligibility <BRK>ryan  amen <BRK>
