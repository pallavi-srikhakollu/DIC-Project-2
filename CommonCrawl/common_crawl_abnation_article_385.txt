when the nfl offseason heat up  one of the biggest storyline to watch every year is which player get the franchise tag  team have a two week window to apply the one year tender  player who get the tag have to either sign their tender or negotiate a long term contract with their team before the july   deadline  <BRK> the franchise tag is essentially a one year contract that guarantee a predetermined salary for player  the salary amount is set by the averaging the top five salary by position for the previous league year  or if it s higher    percent of a player s salary the previous season  so player like quarterback and defensive end will have a much higher tag salary than position like kicker or punter  <BRK> with the salary cap climbing to an estimated    million  here are the estimated salary for each position under the franchise tag in    <BRK> quarterback       millionrunning back       millionwide receiver       milliontight end       millionoffensive linemen       milliondefensive tackle       milliondefensive end       millionlinebackers       millioncornerback       millionsafeties       millionkickers punter       million <BRK> team can only use the tag once per year  there are three different type of tag a team can assign  <BRK> just what the name implies  the player is locked into his team and cannot negotiate with any other team during the free agency period  <BRK> the player is allowed to negotiate with other team  but if a competing team make a free agent offer  the original team ha the right to match it  if they don t match the offer  they get two first round pick in compensation  in other word  this is basically a convoluted trade scenario  <BRK> similar to the non exclusive tag  except the player get paid an average of the top   salary at his position  rather than top five  transition tagged player are free to negotiate with other team  but unlike non exclusive player  the original team get no compensation if it fails to match an offer  <BRK> once a player get tagged  that s when the real drama begin  both side have until mid july to negotiate a long term contract  this ramp up the sense of urgency  team don t want to use the tag because it tie up a huge chunk of their salary cap for just one year  the player don t like it because they don t have any financial security beyond that one year  and have almost no leverage outside of threatening to hold out  if they fail to agree to a long term deal before the deadline  the player is set for his one year contract  <BRK> fortunately for most player  they re often able to secure a new contract with their team and the franchise tag doesn t have to come into play   at least until the next offseason  <BRK> the number of player who are franchise tagged varies by year  six player received the tag this year  six player got some form of a tag last year  and the year before it wa seven  in    there were nine   <BRK> here are the six who were given the tag in    <BRK> frank clark  de  seattle seahawks <BRK>   wa supposed to be a rebuilding year in seattle after the dismantling of the legion of boom defense  clark s career high   sack and   quarterback hit helped lead the seahawks into the postseason instead  with plenty of cap space available  tagging clark could be the franchise s first step in working out a long term deal with the budding star  <BRK> the  seahawks are expected to use the franchise tag on frank clark  source tell  pschrags and me  hope continues to be a long term deal  <BRK> jadeveon clowney  olb  houston texan <BRK> clowney ha been very good in his five seaon a a pro  but he ha yet to unleah that extra gear that made him terrifying at the university of south carolina  his baeline is a pro bowl edge rusher who can approach double digit sack each seaon  but his ceiling is a michael strahan level disruptor who terrorizes quarterback on a series by series bais  tagging him give the texan another seaon to determine whether he s worth a record setting contract   and whether he can keep his recent streak of relatively healthy seaon intact  <BRK> the houston texan have placed the non exclusive franchise designation on de olb jadeveon clowney  the team announced today  pic twitter com hmy qtzwj <BRK> dee ford  olb  kansa city chief <BRK> ford wa part of a triumvirate of pas rusher in kansa city  along with justin houston and chris jones  who made life difficult for quarterback across the afc the past two season  but the club is set to release houston  carving out the space to franchise ford and potentially negotiate a long term deal in the coming week   <BRK> this is important for a chief team that wa too often undone by a weak defensive effort  the club gave up     yard per play    th best in the nfl   even with ford s   sack and league leading seven forced fumble  they re buying in hard that ford can replicate those number  even without houston around to provide a pas rushing bookend at the second level  <BRK> robbie gould  k  san francisco  er <BRK> gould wa the nfl s most accurate kicker last fall  making   of his   kick for a struggling san francisco team  tagging him will keep him in the bay area for a little le than    million  though it seems more likely the niner will sign him to a longer deal before the   season begin  <BRK> the   er have placed the franchise tag on  robbiegould  detail  http   t co t pygyvsif pic twitter com lzlw wnfoy <BRK> grady jarrett  dt  atlanta falcon <BRK> jarrett is a big  blocker absorbing presence in the middle of the atlanta defensive line  and he showed off a little extra pas rushing punch with six sack in   game last fall  he would have had his share of suitor this spring  but the falcon aren t even going to risk it  keeping him in town for one year and      million  locking him in will ensure some stability up front for a defense that need all the help it can get in the nfc south  <BRK> demarcus lawrence  de  dallas cowboy <BRK> lawrence wa put to the test after being tagged in    he pased with flying color  recording double digit sack for the second straight seaon and emerging a one of the league s most powerful pas rusher  the cowboy reportedly tried to work out a deal with him before the franchise tag deadline  but if they couldn t agree on term  that ha left lawrence staring down another year under the tag  this time  he d get a   percent bump over lat year s salary under nfl rule  which put him at      million for    <BRK> however  lawrence ha said he won t sign a second tender  the two side have until july   to reach a multiyear deal  <BRK> here are a few notable name who will hit free agency  <BRK> le veon bell  rb  pittsburgh steelers <BRK> one player who won t be franchised   for the first time since     is steelers  tailback le veon bell  who sat out all of    he s finally headed for unrestricted free agency  <BRK> landon collins  s  new york giant <BRK> collins ha starred in new york s disheveled secondary  emerging a a rare bright spot in an otherwise regrettable stretch for the giant  he could be a building block for the future  but pat shurmur s team isn t flush with cah this offseaon  <BRK> collins reportedly cleaned out his locker in the giant  facility  and certainly didn t seem like he wanted to stay in new york  <BRK> the stuff in that locker that i have left i do not need  <BRK> good news for collins  then  the giant are going to let him walk  <BRK> the  giant have now informed s landon collins that he won t be franchise tagged  putting a top player on the free agent market  source say  <BRK> trey flower  de  new england patriot <BRK> flower  versatility ha been tremendously valuable in new england  a his ability to take on different role across the trench ha helped a pair of defensive coordinator level up to head coaching position the pat two year  the former fourth round pick ha led the patriot in sack in each of the pat three seaons  even if his overall number in that span     isn t especially impressive  flower ha proven himself a perfect fit up front for bill belichick   the question now is whether the patriot can meet his aking price in free agency after the club declined to retain him with the franchise tag this spring  <BRK> nick foles  qb  philadelphia eagle <BRK> the eagle could have traded foles rather than allow him to leave in free agency with no compensation  locking him down with the non exclusive tag would allow the team to gauge trade request while keeping the door open for the super bowl   mvp to return to philadelphia   albeit at a high price   <BRK> instead  general manager howie roseman say the eagle won t tag foles  allowing him to remain an unrestricted free agent  he s expected to sign with the jaguar once the new league year start  <BRK> c j  mosley  ilb  baltimore raven <BRK> mosley ha been a sideline to sideline wrecking ball for the raven  keeping up a proud tradition of dynamic linebacker play in maryland  while the club hope to keep him in black and purple in    it won t do so with the franchise tag  <BRK> donovan smith  ot  tampa bay buccaneer <BRK> smith ha started all   game with the bucs since being drafted in    and the team value his consistency at left tackle  while tampa wa expected to place the franchise tag on smith  it s keeping him around in a different way instead  with a new deal  <BRK> the  buccaneer have reached agreement on a three year       million deal with lt donovan  smith  source say  he get    million fully guaranteed  team and smith avoid the franchise tag  he stick in tampa  <BRK> five player received the franchise tag and one  bear cornerback kyle fuller  wa given the transition tag  one  jarvis landry  wa traded from miami to cleveland after being tagged  another  le veon bell  opted to sit out the year and shoot for a long term contract in   instead  the other three player to be tagged were lawrence  ram safety lamarcus joyner  and lion defensive end ezekiel ansah  <BRK>
