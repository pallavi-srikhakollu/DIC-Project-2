it feel a though we ve been through this before   perhaps several time   iowa  insert sport team here  is off to a really good start  but the fanbae is more focused on how they are going to collapse than enjoying the ride   in fact  it feel like we go through this at leat once a year with one of the program  <BRK> yet  here we are again   your iowa men s basketball team is waking this morning       they ran the table in what many thought wa going to be a very difficult non conference schedule  look  i get it  there were a bunch of sub   team in there  but you measure the strength of a non con by the top rather than the bottom  and nearly half way through the big ten schedule  they re now sitting a half game out of the top   in what is arguably the best conference in america  <BRK> despite that  there are still a number of question from fan   the biggest seems to be whether this team can keep it hot streak alive a the schedule stiffens   if you re in the minority who han t spent the   game winning streak looking ahead  here it is  <BRK>         msu at home  likely to move higher in today s ranking        minnesota        michigan at home  likely to fall a bit after losing to wisconsin           indiana  likely to fall out of the ranking today  <BRK> an optimist and look at that stretch and see the two toughest opponent coming to carver   a pessimist look at it and see that iowa ha to travel to the two team they would have the best opportunity to beat   both are equally correct  <BRK> all told    of iowa s   remaining game will be against team that were ranked last week   five of the seven against unranked opponent are on the road    that s a season defining stretch  <BRK> so for once  hawkeye fan  perpetual wait for the other shoe to drop may be warranted   but what if it s not   are you prepared for a genuinely successful iowa basketball season   have you spoken with your child about the possibility that this hawkeye team is just good  <BRK> a fierce a that remaining schedule is  all indication so far are that this group is  in fact  for real   how for real   how about only the second time under fran mccaffery the team ha started       that lat time   that wa    <BRK> the team finished with a collapse  losing   of   down the stretch   but despite their best effort  they still walked into the ncaa tournament with a   seed and advanced to the round of      <BRK> this team  despite their very difficult schedule down the stretch  is now likely to do the same   they may never reach the ranking height of that    squad  they were ranked a high a    with the football team also in the top     sigh   but this team is headed to the ncaa tournament barring a collapse wherein they lose essentially every game for the rest of the year  <BRK> the question now is how this group will respond to the pressure of being ranked inside the top    frankly  it would be criminal if they aren t ranked there by the end of today  with big time game with a pair of top   team coming up   in    thing got disastrous down the stretch  but this season appears to be different    <BRK> in addition to those difficulty facing the team outlined above  this year s version also ha a pair of game against rutgers and a home date with the same northwestern team they defeated in evanston without tyler cook   in a glass half full world  they do get a number of the toughest opponent at home   and this team is damn good at home  <BRK> yesterday  for example  this group shot an astounding    from the field   the only thing more blistering than the overall field goal percentage wa the   point percentage   a mind numbing     <BRK> today wa iowa s best shooting performance under coach fran mccaffery           fg  broke the previous best of      against maryland  feb                    fg  broke the previous best of            against northern illinois  nov        hawkeyes <BRK> one of the top reason for the unreal shooting performance wa joe wieskamp   the freshman ha been on fire of late  scoring in double figure in   of the last   game   on sunday  he dropped   on     shooting  including     from beyond the arc    <BRK> from a roster standpoint  the only difference between this year s top   team and last year s    win season is joe wieskamp   the rest ha been addition by subtraction   nothing against any of those player absent from this year s squad  but the limited number ha forced mccaffery s hand in term of rotation and minute    <BRK> this year s rotation is noticeably tighter than in year past   that is presumably in large part due to the limited number of body   it s also mean a slightly longer leash for player who have a head scratching turnover or an ill timed foul    <BRK> that ha allowed guy like isaiah moss to ebb and flow in their minute based on their game with a bit of a longer leash   in game like the one iowa played in happy valley on wednesday  that mean moss spends much of the second half on the bench while the hot hand get plenty of run   in game like sunday  he get   minute to knock down     pointer and score   point against him home state school  <BRK> each game  we re seeing someone different step up   the defensive intensity ha had some minor lapse  but by and large it s a gigantic step up from what we saw a season ago   that intensity ha led to continued offensive success  <BRK> despite injury to some of iowa s most important player  including both big men  tyler cook and luka garza   the hawkeyes are a finding a way to win and to win comfortably   without cook on wednesday  iowa wa still able to pound the ball inside   they got a combined   point from garza and ryan kriener off the bench    <BRK> what ankle injury  iamtc  rise for the highlight  iowahoops hammer  btnstandout x  autoownersins pic twitter com o ockzpgo <BRK> in cook s sunday return  he only scored   point in his   minute  but wa still a major factor   garza  meanwhile  continues to be a force inside with the oldest of old man game that ha to utterly infuriate a team like illinois that s built on pure athleticism   he finished with    making it three hawkeyes over the mark  joining wieskamp at   and moss at     <BRK> this is a well rounded group that can beat team from the inside our out   they don t have the penetrator that a number of top team posse  but they have tool all over the court   there will be night a number of guy are off  but given the volume of scorer  it s unlikely there won t be anyone capable of putting the team on their back  <BRK> the combination of that versatility  the potency of the offense and the new found defensive effort make this iowa team different from any we ve seen in the mccaffery era   it harkens back to some of the early redacted team or the tom davis team before that  <BRK> it s in our nature to expect thing to fall apart   a hawkeye fan  we are always expecting the inevitable  there s a collapse just around the corner   but this time  the fall may not be so far   the piece are there   the road ahead is long and arduous  but it s not insurmountable and the work already done is likely enough to eliminate the possibility of being left out of the tournament    <BRK> it s time to talk with your kid about the real possibility that this iowa basketball team is simply good  <BRK>     pic twitter com  w znthyfp <BRK> happy monday   come out firing this week like
