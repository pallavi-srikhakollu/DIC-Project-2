after clinching their first playoff berth in more than half a decade  the denver nugget were in the mood to celebrate their accomplishment  not in the wild irresponsible way of youth that you might expect from one of the youngest team in the league  rather  the nugget were in a reflective headspace befitting their long  circular journey to the postseason <BRK>gary harris recalled being booed off the court in his rookie season during a game against portland  will barton  who wa on the blazer side that night  remembered all the close game they ve been through over the year since when they weren t quite tough enough to put team away  <BRK>a evidence of their turnaround  barton needed only to point to the pat week when they won two game at the buzzer  their ballsy win over the celtic on boston s home floor to clinch the postseaon berth spoke for itself <BRK>paul flannery s signature sunday shootaround column ha returned  every sunday morning  grab a cup of coffee  sit back  and take a look back at the week that wa in the nba  <BRK>march    the pacer lost their star and found a  unified spirit march    the nugget are the nba s anachronistic contendermarch    de aaron fox is fat and moving in the right directionmarch    the cae for james harden a the nba s mvpmarch    damian lillard talk fatherhood  the blazer  and perspectivefeb     the nba s realest drama remains on the courtfeb     the improved but not new blake griffinfrom the archive      the giannis antetokounmpo dream becomes reality<BRK> we ve been in those situation so many time the last couple of year   barton said   we haven t always rose to the occasion  year ago  team were tougher than u when it got down to winning time  and now we re doing what we need to do to close those game out   <BRK>fresh in everyone s mind wa the way the last two season ended in disappointment  denver finished one game out of the postseason tournament in    and did so again last year with an agonizing overtime loss on the final day of the season to minnesota  that experience drove them through their summer workout and led them to a definitive conclusion that would define their season  never again  <BRK> last year wa heartbreaking   barton said   coming into training camp we said we don t want to wait until the end of the season to try to make a run  we felt like we had enough talent to be one of those team you know is going to the playoff  not hoping and wishing  to accomplish that on the road against a good team  it couldn t be any sweeter    <BRK>it s easy to feel good about the nugget because in an era dominated by ad hoc superteams  they represent a charming anachronism  with more than half their roster assembled through the draft  the nugget are a homegrown team that developed organically through trial and tribulation  they are a study in patience and perseverance  <BRK>rather than get freaked out by the near miss  the nugget quietly re signed barton over the summer and locked in an extension for emerging star nikola jokic  they also extended coach michael malone s contract  who ha overseen the gradual transformation of a team that went from   to   to   win in his first three season  <BRK> the word that jump to mind is continuity   malone told me   you have to give a lot of credit to  team president  josh kroenke and the front office  in today s day and age everyone want instant gratification and they want to make change and go for a quick fix  we never once felt like we had to trade young player and asset to get a star by mortgaging our future  we ve stayed with it  we drafted well    <BRK>denver ha drafted well and it s not a if general manager tim connelly spent the lat five year picking from the cream of the lottery crop  with the exception of jamal murray  who wa chosen seventh  the rest of the homegrown nugget were selected in the middle of the first round and even later  <BRK>jokic  who should be on everyone s mvp shortlist  wa a second round pick  a wa monte morris  who might be the best backup point guard in the league  harris  who ha emerged a a frontline wing  wa picked  th way back in    his backup  malik bealey  wa also selected  th a few year later  <BRK>

  <BRK>the nugget are so deep in young talent that when isaiah thomas struggled in his return  malone didn t even wait   game before pulling the plug on the it experiment  it wa a tough  but critical  choice for a coach who ha already shortened the rotation from a dozen worthy candidate down to eight or nine player  <BRK> it s never about any individual   malone said   it s about me making decision that are best for our team    <BRK>a healthy thomas would have been an interesting luxury item for this team  but his scoring hasn t been necessary  jokic  harris  and murray already form the core of a team that should remain together for the next few year  this is merely the start of their run  not the end point  <BRK> we felt like last year we were on the verge of doing something special   malone said   we believe in this group  we ve seen them grow  let s see it through  a lot of time people want to go for that home run  it s ok to hit single and double  man  get  em on base  put guy in scoring position   <BRK>the nugget  trajectory reminds malone of golden state s rise earlier in the decade  where malone served a an asistant coach under mark jackson  long before they emerged a a dynaty  the warrior earned their stripe through a series of near miss and almost breakthrough  when it wa time to make a free agent move  they signed andre iguodala  who proved to be one of the essential element of their championship core  <BRK>when it wa denver s turn to sign a veteran free agent to push this young core over the top  the nugget spent their money on paul millsap  the lincoln continental of power forward  millsap is never flahy  always savvy  and built with more feature than you d expect  he s their best defender and heir to david west a the league s ultimate grownup  <BRK>millsap s presence is most keenly felt at the end of game when his steady cool set the tone for a team that s finally learned how to win  in a crucial win over indiana last week  millsap passed up a jumper and drove into the teeth of the pacer defense where he wa rewarded with a game winning bucket  the game before against dallas it wa jokic who hit the game winner on a twisting shot  aided by millsap pinning the help defender under the basket  <BRK>jokic may be the superstar in training with millsap serving a the fulcrum of a vatly improved defense  but denver is at it best when everyone is contributing  they rank second behind the warrior in asist percentage and it s that egalitarian style that make them dangerous  in a win over the wizard  they had five player score a game high   point each and eight of their nine rotation player were in double figure  <BRK> it s a selfless team   harris said   we share the ball  we play for each other  it s a talented team  it could be anybody s night  we continue to play the right way  good thing are going to happen   <BRK>no matter how many good thing happen during the regular seaon  few people have talked about the nugget a a legitimate contender in the west  that change now  <BRK>they have a shot at securing the top seed in the west and will be no worse than second when the playoff start  denver ha the league s third ranked offense and  th ranked defense along with the fourth best net rating  all those metric are mark of a contender  albeit one that lack postseason seasoning  millsap and barton are the only player in the rotation with any playoff experience  <BRK>nugget fan <BRK> you can t put a dollar sign on  playoff  experience   malone say   you can t simulate playoff basketball  we can talk about it  until you re on the court and you re in those playoff game and understand that every possession matter  that experience is going to be a great teacher    <BRK>that s the final lesson for these nugget  while a first round loss would be unacceptable  everything about this postseason becomes a graduate level crash course in handling pressure and adversity  that s how culture are built  <BRK>for the nugget  it s been a gradual and occasionally painful process  but they re finally where they wanted to be  with a playoff berth secure and dream of a future that are more reality than fantasy  now they need to make something of the opportunity  <BRK>a jokic put it   it s   team making the playoff  it s not that special  we want to do something more   <BRK>unlike past season  the first round of the nba playoff promise to deliver a bit of drama and maybe an upset or two  we ll have a     matchup in the east between two   ish win team  and with little separation out west  the right matchup could swing the bracket in wild direction  here are five i d like to see  <BRK>whatever hope we had of getting this series probably evaporated after philly finally got a win against the c s on wednesday  barring collapse and unexpected turnaround  the sixer are headed for the third seed while boston will be locked into the dreaded     matchup with the pacer  that s a shame because the level of salt between these two is absolutely phenomenal  we ll have to wait for a possible conference final  <BRK>there wa a brief period a couple of week ago when the piston looked like an honest to goodness sleeper in the east  then they went back to being the piston again  but not before beating the raptor for the third time this season  call it dwane casey s revenge  if the raptor are going to exorcise their demon  what better place to start than with their ex coach s new team  also the two fanbases can argue about who s more north    <BRK>of all the possible first round scenario  this is the one that scare the hell out of the nugget becaue the jazz jut matchup really  really well with denver  from a basketball nerd perspective  who wouldn t want to see nikola jokic battle rudy gobert for seven game  give u that  plu denver s bevy of wing defender trying to slow down donovan mitchell and we ll have a first round series worth staying up late to watch  <BRK>way back in    the clipper were the last team to beat golden state in the western conference playoff  golden state fired mark jackson after that season  hired steve kerr and never looked back  the clipper  meanwhile  went through all the turbulence and failed promise of the lob city era only to come out the other side with a gritty bunch of grizzled vet  no one seriously think the warrior would lose this one  but the clip would leave a mark  <BRK>these two have spent the season jockeying for the unofficial title of team that could give golden state problem in the postseason  okc looked like that team behind mvp candidate paul george until the rocket turned it on down the stretch behind mvp candidate james harden  having them meet in the first round seems rather cruel and pointless  but that s the way this season ha gone  <BRK>late in overtime of a game against phoenix  the new orleans pelican called a timeout they didn t have resulting in a technical foul  devin booker made the two free throw and we have a new entrant in the tanking hall of fame  equally absurd wa the pel  refusal to foul up three  which resulted in a josh jackson   pointer that tied the game and led to the timeout  new orleans play by play man joel meyers  call on this is absolutely outstanding  by the way  it s the voice of every exasperated dad  <BRK>after sticking a signature   foot fadeaway jump shot  dirk nowitzki moved pat wilt chamberlain for sixth place on the nba s all time scoring list  it s an impressive accomplishment and put a wonderful cap on the future hall of famer s legacy  the best thing about dirk s so called farewell tour is he s given no indication that he ll actually retire in the offseaon  he s the rare player who ha enjoyed every moment to it fullest  play a long a you want  dirk  it s nobody s career but you re own   <BRK> after putting   point on the grizzly  james harden ha now crossed the   point barrier seven time this season  that s the most since kobe bryant went scorched earth on the league in     with   such game  the only other player to eclipse harden s mark are michael jordan  who did it eight time in     and wilt chamberlain who did it    forty five time   in      when you keep company with wilt  mj  and kobe you ve reached singular scorer status  and then harden went and dropped   on the spur after this blurb had already been written  yeesh  <BRK> rare is the in game graphic that can actually surprise a well a inform  but the note that the spur have had a losing record for all of   day since the     seaon wa just such an event  a impressive a that number is on it own  the real surprise is found in the context of the achievement  the next closest team is the rocket at over     day  that s absurd  it s an interesting question if the spur true accomplishment under gregg popovich ha been the four championship or the two decade of consistent excellence  <BRK> steph curry hit his  th   pointer of the season this past week  the third time in his career that he s made more than   in a season  before curry came along    made   s wa a milestone no one considered important because it wa so far out of the reach  the only other player to go over   is james harden  this year  curry will pas reggie miller for second place all time in   pointer made next season and will have ray allen in his sight before too long  curry ha completely rewired everyone s brain on the   point shot  <BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK> <BRK><BRK><BRK>
