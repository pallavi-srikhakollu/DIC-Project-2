espn recently had a panel of their so called  nfl expert  make a bunch of prediction for the   nfl offseason  one of the portion of their feature ha a section called  designing realistic offseason trade that help both team   this section contains three different trade idea involving the philadelphia eagle  so let s take a look and grade each of them  <BRK> dan graziano s explanation   why not  the jaguar have clearly soured on fournette  and the eagle obviously don t need foles at the franchise tag price  fournette would give philadelphia the kind of back legarrette blount wa for them during their super bowl run  only better  if he can stay healthy   and the salary relief  fournette is scheduled to make about      million this year and      million next  could help jacksonville take on foles on a new contract   <BRK> blg s take  this idea ha been previously suggested  i get where it come from  the jag really need a quarterback and the eagle really need a running back  fournette clearly isn t in the best standing with jacksonville following the jag  decision to void all the guarantee in his contract  but while this swap might make sense in madden  i don t see it happening  fournette s career     yard per rush attempt isn t particularly enticing  neither are his durability and maturity issue  fournette also carry a      million cap hit in   and a      million cap hit in    so he s not quite a affordable a graziano make it seem  i think the eagle would  rightfully  rather receive a   third round pick from jacksonville than fournette   <BRK> grade the trade  what say you  <BRK> this poll is closed  <BRK> k c  joyner s explanation  philadelphia doesn t have anyone in it secondary who can shut down amari cooper  odell beckham jr  or the rest of the powerhouse nfc wide receiver  a first round pick is a big price to pay  but ramsey hasn t been happy in jacksonville and could be a perfect fit for a team with super bowl ambition  <BRK> blg s take  it d be nice if the eagle could just trade foles for ramsey  but that ain t happening  should the eagle trade a first round pick for ramsey  if cap space wasn t an issue  absolutely  unfortunately for philly  the eagle do have to weigh getting five year of cost controlled talent by drafting someone in the first round versus giving up a pick for an outspoken player who s soon projected to be highest paid cornerback in league history  ramsey is under contract at a relatively reasonable      million cap number in   and the eagle could activate his fifth year option for   if they traded for him  it s a fun idea to think about  but i think philly will keep their pick and stick with the talented youth they already have at corner  i also think it would take more than just the eagle  late first round selection to pry ramsey away from jacksonville  so  not a perfectly realistic proposal   <BRK> grade the trade  what say you  <BRK> this poll is closed  <BRK> field yates  explanation  this idea wa floated in advance of the trade deadline following the early season injury to jay ajayi  with reason to understand the motivation  the eagle were one of just two team to not have a single player rush for   or more yard this past season  mccoy enters the final year of his contract and ha seen a declining level of production over the past two season  a change of scenery could spark a return to form and allow philly to streamline it backfield  <BRK> blg s take  it s hard to totally dismiss this possibility when you consider the eagle reportedly tried to trade for mccoy back in    a yates mentioned  the eagle also reportedly  reached out  to the bill regarding mccoy s availability prior to the   trade deadline  so  yeah  i wouldn t be absolutely shocked if the eagle brought shady back to philly  then again  mccoy s age  turn   in july   declining production      average in     and off field issue  read more  all represent red flag  mccoy ha been rumored to be a potential salary cap caualty so maybe the eagle won t even have to give up anything for him if they truly want him back   <BRK> grade the trade  what say you  <BRK> this poll is closed  <BRK> which trade would you make for the eagle  <BRK> this poll is closed  <BRK>
