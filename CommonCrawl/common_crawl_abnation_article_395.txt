von miller  j j  watt  khalil mack  demarcus lawrence  cameron jordan  ryan kerrigan  carlos dunlap  danielle hunter  t j  watt  cameron wake  <BRK> there used to be a time  not too long ago in fact  when left tackle were seen a having a much higher value than right tackle for most team  part of the argument in favor of this wa because they were protecting the quarterback s  blindside   provided the quarterback wa right handed  a the overwhelming majority of nfl quarterback have been   another part of the argument  however  wa that left tackle usually had to go against their opponent s best edge rusher  and a lot of defense back then did put their best edge rusher on the right side for a variety of reaons  <BRK> well  do you see those name listed up above  one thing they have in common is they all do a great job of pas rushing from the edge  the other thing they have in common is they all primarily rush from the defensive left edge  these day  if your right tackle isn t top notch too  your quarterback is likely going to be running for his life damn near every week   <BRK> enter former florida right tackle jawaan taylor  <BRK> taylor actually would be an upgrade for most team at right tackle from what i saw in these four game of his i watched  he doesn t block people a much a he maul them  and that s the kind of mean streak i want in my offensive linemen   <BRK> i loved the edge he played with and the way he tried to dominate his opposition on every play  he came off the ball hard  exploded out of his hip  and fired into people all game long  watching him come off and drive defender off the line of scrimmage wa like watching an avalanche fall on somebody and seeing it wah them away a if they were never there  <BRK> while preparing to write this column i saw taylor benched pressed   pound   time at the combine  which isn t bad  but also isn t exactly eye popping  either  i just want to tell you  flat out  that i don t really give a damn about that bench press number  what i saw on film made it obvious to me that this is a very powerful young man  <BRK> he served up plenty enough pancake to make me a believer  <BRK> i don t have any question about whether taylor is strong enough to be dominant in the nfl  if you watch a few play of his tape you wouldn t have any  either   <BRK> of course  i know there aren t a lot of nfl team playing smashmouth football on offense anymore  so being a big time run blocker doen t necessarily carry the kind of weight that it used to  but i still personally appreciate an offensive lineman who so conspicuously relish run blocking the way that taylor doe  he wan t just making block   he wa steamrolling people   <BRK> and some of taylor s double team with his right guard   chef s kiss  <BRK> oh man  lining up between taylor and the right guard and catching that double whammy wasn t any fun at all  <BRK> but  just to be clear  taylor didn t necessarily need any help to put defender on their back  that guy wa like a grizzly bear out there manhandling fool   <BRK> where taylor separated himself wa in being able to maul people in space almost a well a he wa able to maul people lined up right across from him  i wa particularly impressed with how he wa able to work his way up to the second level and get on a linebacker and not only stick to them  but actually drive block them  too  <BRK> that take good footwork  a lot of coordination  and uncommon balance for a man taylor s size  it s usually a lot harder than it look  too   <BRK> for a much a taylor like to flex his physicality  the guy is seriously athletic a well  he can be a clasic road grader type a a run blocker for sure  but he s also quick and nimble on his foot when the situation called for it  <BRK> he wa even excellent at pulling  which isn t always true for a lot of offensive tackle  the few time florida asked him to pull to his left in the four game i watched  he looked fast  fluid  and under control every time   <BRK> but those weren t the only time that taylor wa able to showcase his athleticism  he also had to sprint outside to try to block cornerback on few screen play  <BRK> it wan t always pretty  but he did a good job with his blocking in those situation a well   <BRK> with his athleticism and power taylor should fit in with pretty much any running game scheme the team that draft him might run  whether he is doing a lot of zone blocking or man blocking  whoever is lined up across from him better bring their lunch pail and hard hat that day  <BRK> somebody might want to warn the pa rusher about him  because taylor wa not too shabby at pa blocking  a a matter of fact  i wa really impressed with how often he seemed to baically envelop edge rusher at time  it wan t just that he wa winning the rep  he wa forcing pa rusher to abandon their hope of reaching the quarterback   <BRK> time and time again i m watching these different cat come off the ball well  but then a soon a they locked up with taylor  it wa like someone had flipped their switch to off  their foot stopped moving and so did their arm  and they just kinda stood there waiting for the ball to be thrown after that  <BRK> i can promise you a a former defensive lineman who later went on to coach a little bit  those edge rusher did not want to see those play in the film room with their position coach and the rest of the defensive line the next day  <BRK> you can bet that   <BRK> let me also say that it is fairly uncommon to see an offensive tackle shut guy down like that on a pretty regular bais the way that taylor did  a with his run blocking  he wan t just winning those rep  he wa dominating his competition   <BRK> even when the edge rusher were able to keep working their move  taylor wa usually able to hold them off from getting to his quarterback  whether it wa a power rush or a speed rush  i thought he held up remarkably well in pas protection over that four game span  <BRK> his pas set wa consistent  his punch wa good too  and he did a great job of not panicking when a pas rusher got by him momentarily   <BRK> his ability to recover and push the edge rusher wide on several play where it looked like he had been beaten around the corner wa one of the thing about taylor that definitely stood out to me  not only did he not give up on those play  but he wa actually athletic enough to turn and catch up in time to keep those guy off his quarterback   <BRK> having said that  there wa something that gave me a little bit of concern about taylor s tape  he wan t beaten all that often in pas protection  but when he wa it always seemed to be some kind of inside move  <BRK> sometimes it wa the pas rusher s initial move  sometimes it wa a counter move off a speed rush  <BRK> regardless  the fact it happened multiple time mean it s not something i can completely ignore   <BRK> from the top   free agent  to mock draft  to scouting report  we ve got everything you need to get through the offseason  all in one place  <BRK> this seems like a good time to point out that we have reached that threshold of draft seaon where i have done enough of them that i get to see some of the subject of my previous draft profile play against the guy i m currently breaking down  i wa able to watch taylor compete against former kentucky linebacker josh allen and former mississippi state defensive end montez sweat  which wa fun because i have already declared how much i like those two guy a prospect  <BRK> i don t think it wa any coincidence that of the handful of time taylor wa  beaten  at all in pas protection  allen and sweat were the two main culprit  but  with the caveat that neither guy rushed against him a lot in either game  i do not believe that either guy came close to working taylor over  <BRK> he held his own and there were a few play where he gave them the business   <BRK> at the end of the day  no offensive lineman is going to win every battle  so i m not tripping off of a few time when he didn t quite get a couple of first round talent blocked  especially when he didn t give up any sack in the game i watched  <BRK> i think taylor should work on getting better at handling counter move inside  of course  but i wouldn t make a mountain out of a molehill  i saw him handle plenty of inside move just fine  so i m not exactly going to freak out about it   <BRK> on the whole  i thoroughly enjoyed watching taylor s film because he really like to get after people and it show  i see him a a guy who can come in and start from day one at right tackle and be an anchor for his offensive line for the next decade  barring injury  he can be a tempo setter who brings an attitude and an edge to the running game and who can also hold his own just fine on pasing down  <BRK> if for some odd reason he doesn t work out at tackle  taylor also appears to move well enough to kick inside at guard if need be  too  at     and   pound he ha the size to play either position  and evidently the people say his arm are  long enough  too  i think he is worthy of a mid first round pick at least  and certainly higher for a team that either ha a need at right tackle  and or ha to face several guy in that murderer s row of edge rusher i noted up above  <BRK> taylor will match up with those guy about a well a any right tackle could  in my estimation  so i suggest those right tackle needy team run  not walk  to turn his name in on draft night if they are fortunate enough to get the opportunity to select him   <BRK> for the purpose of this breakdown  i watched former florida right tackle jawaan taylor play against kentucky  mississippi state  lsu  and georgia  those represented the second  fifth  sixth  and eighth game on florida s schedule last season  respectively  <BRK>
