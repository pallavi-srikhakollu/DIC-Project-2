last summer  oakland a s draft pick kyler murray signed a contract with a      million signing bonus  after a heisman winning football season  murray then declared for the nfl draft  opening a door that seemed like it had closed  <BRK> now he s in a rare position a a professional athlete  not only doe he have the option to play one of two pro sport  he s likely going to end up being taken in the first round of both draft   <BRK> making his situation even more unusual  he won t even be the first person in his family to face a similar career decision   <BRK> both his father  kevin  and uncle  calvin  were pro baseball player  calvin wa actually at bat when randy johnson exploded that bird   kevin signed in two sport coming out of high school  he did so once with texas a m s football program in february of his senior year      and again in june s mlb draft  after some time in the minor  he decided he wanted to play football    <BRK> murray originally signed a      deal in   with the milwaukee brewer to play professional baseball  murray played in   game for the brewer  rookie league team in pikeville  kentucky   batting     before heading home for dallas   week in  <BRK>  it ha a culture shock   he said   i wasn t mature enough to deal with it at that point in my life   <BRK> murray enrolled at texas a m in january   with plan of playing football  <BRK>  my arm just wasn t used to baseball  i almost ruined my elbow  i got some tendinitis in there  and it still hurt a little bit   murray told the austin american statesman in     <BRK> that triggered a legal battle for that      guaranteed signing bonus  <BRK> the brewer filed suit and sought an injunction to prevent him from playing for the aggies  arguing breach of contract  according to the statesman  murray thought his obligation to the brewer wa only for one year  the brewer said he signed a deal that gave the team the right to renew the pact each year for six year  per an article by the galveston daily news   <BRK> a brewer executive said under oath that an a m booster had given kevin a car and other incentive  kevin denied that under oath   in the early   s  when the southwest conference wa the wild west of recruiting violation  that s not out of the realm of possibility  the allegation followed him for year   <BRK> murray wa allowed to play football when a judge struck down the injunction   <BRK> the judge ruled murray breached his contract with the brewer and in so doing wa no longer bound by a contract clause that forbade him to play football  she also ruled the contract amounted to involuntary servitude  prohibited by the  th amendment  <BRK> he then led the aggies to two conference championship and broke some record  but after being passed on in the nfl draft  he ended up not fulfilling his professional promise  some of that had to do with injury concern  but his former offensive coordinator alleged murray wa  blackballed    <BRK> while his father s spat wa over a      bonus  kyler ha already earned considerably more   <BRK> the a s are allowed by rule to give murray an mlb deal for much more than his     m signing bonus if he opts for baseball but sunday s meeting  which also included mlb marketing chief barbara mchugh  only regarded the a s belief in his baseball potential  no   were discussed  <BRK> if he stay on a standard rookie deal  he ll earn a league minimum of around      per at least his first two season  most likely three  in baseball  rookie deal work like a normal nfl deal  signing bonus up front  but the team can cut him   <BRK> if he s a first round nfl draft pick  at minimum he s looking at a four year     million deal with a    million signing bonus up front  based off projection at each pick slot  if he s a top   pick     million     million signing bonus  rookie nfl deal for first round player are guaranteed for four year   <BRK> here s the money in the immediate future of each path  <BRK> murray know the nfl will pay him major league money up front  baseball might have to do the same just to get him in a minor league bus   <BRK> there were rumor that kyler s camp  he s repped by baseball super agent scott boras  set a hard number to re do his deal with    million more guaranteed from the a s  clearly due to this nfl leverage  <BRK> furthermore  re doing murray s deal would amount to accelerating the regular process  baseball contract go to arbitration for the best player in year    that s when the team writes what they think he s worth  murray writes what he think he s worth  and a third party settle it  but that s only after  most likely  his third year in the major     and there s no guarantee he d make the major  <BRK> basically  a reworked deal would mean the a s giving murray the if you panned out money up front  <BRK> top a s exec are in dallas meeting with kyler murray to try to convince him to stick with baseball  the heisman trophy winner ha until tomorrow to declare for nfl draft  oakland gave him    m bonus after making him a  st rounder in mlb draft  scout love his bat and foot speed  <BRK> football wa a fallback for kyler s father  he fell out of love with baseball  he wa an  th round baseball pick and got passed over by the nfl draft  plenty of athlete have done what kevin did   <BRK> but kyler s beyond even the vast majority of athlete drafted by either the nfl or mlb  he s basically in the    percent of    percent  not even bo jackson wa taken in two first round   <BRK> the likely last date we ll figure out if kyler will play pro football is in mid february  when he s supposed to report to spring training  following that is the nfl combine  if he doesn t go to the combine  this might have been a pure leverage play all along   <BRK> the boardroom aspect is separately incredible  only coming about because the a s let him play another season of football   <BRK> whether they let him do it in good faith or murray boras hardballed their ass off  there is no first round nfl potential if he didn t play football in    the a s were within their right to tell him to sit football out  although that would have likely nuked the relationship  murray s contract left the door open  and his athletic talent broke it down  <BRK> kevin murray is a metaphor for every other athlete caught between two sport  he wa just like any employee in any other industry at the mercy of the court  kyler murray  however  took an opportunity and ran with it to a place nobody could have envisioned  <BRK>
