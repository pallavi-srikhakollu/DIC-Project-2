very moment  i let the pressure sink into my mind   guy wrote  he explained how the loss felt almost surreal  how after hunter had to drag him off of the court  he apologized to the senior before sitting in the shower and cry   there aren t many people who know what it s like to be the only person  program in this instance  in the world to be on the wrong side of history   no one understands the sheer pain and fear to be ridiculed  misery love company     <BRK> but guy also wrote how the loss wa a turning point   it wa also at this moment a i walked off the stage that i vowed to not quit and to not let this define me  that feeling of drowning while being able to see everyone else breathe   i wa going to work my as off to never feel this way again   <BRK>  that wa me opening up  so people knew that they weren t alone   guy say   even if you think someone s having the greatest life  being a no    seed and a third team all american  they still go through stuff  don t be so quick to judge   <BRK> guy deleted all social medium apps from his phone  he finished the semester  often walking around campus with his head down  earbuds in  <BRK>  in college  basketball aside  you go through a lot   say guy s roommate and teammate grant kersey   then you add basketball   we just go out to breakfast and he get recognized  people see when the light are on  they don t see the other side   <BRK> when the semester ended  grant drove to charlottesville to pick up guy  on the ride home  grant reminded guy that he couldn t please everyone  or he d be a hamster on a wheel   when you are number one  and you have million of eye on you  you have a platform   grant reminded guy   and if you re a pleaser  it can be a recipe for disaster  that wear on you   <BRK> grant and his family

talk  noting the envy and jealousy that stem from social medium scanning  morin share her own struggle  including the sudden loss of her mother  her first husband  and her father in law   <BRK>  the only way to get through uncomfortable emotion  to deal with them  is you have to go through them   morin say   to let yourself feel sad and then move on  and to gain confidence in your ability to deal with that discomfort    <BRK>  i think initially  he wanted to sweep  the ncaa tournament loss  the season s stress  under the rug  but now he s embraced it and the emotion that come with that   grant say   he wa still kind of in a gray area  emotionally  but i could tell he wa on his way back up   <BRK> just before   p m  on thursday  nov     guy sat inside the football team meeting room at uva s mccue center  he d arrived to moderate an inaugural student athlete mental health panel  designed to encourage conversation among uva student athlete about the stigma of mental health  and how to work through them  <BRK> when planning who might speak   we wanted to bring kyle in because we knew it would draw a bigger crowd   say sophomore nicola ferris  one of the co organizer  she emailed guy  who happily agreed to take part  <BRK> guy opened the discussion with the   plus attendee by detailing the aftermath following his team s final game  he talked about the death threat  the hate mail  and how he and his teammate   young men playing a game they love   were the recipient of such intense vitriol  he still hadn t completely recovered from the season s abrupt end  however  he had found way to work through those pressure and move forward   <BRK>  everyone struggle through something   say uva senior baeball pitcher chesdin harrington  who attended the event   we talked a lot  at the panel  about how  a athlete  you re expected to be mentally tough and to perform at the highest level  continuously  without aking for help  but you have to let thing go and ak for help  whether it s a teammate  a friend  or a professional   <BRK> initially  guy wa reticent to see freeman  after their first meeting last year   i didn t want to be that person that ha to see a sport psychologist   guy say  but jenkins pressed him to continue the conversation  they began to meet weekly  a process they ve continued   it didn t just help me on the court  it helped me in life   guy add  <BRK> freeman ha worked at uva in various therapeutic and research capacity for   year  along with his colleague  associate sport psychologist dr  karen egan  he spends hour each day talking individually with many of the   uva student athlete   <BRK>  my main headline is that mental health is health   freeman say   so  to separate that or make it lesser than or different than health creates stigma and barrier to actually treating anything that s going on with the person    <BRK> according to freeman  uva us an all encompassing approach to supporting student health  whether addressing sport concussion  learning issue and how they affect performance  mental health issue and how they affect well being or performance psychology  and other area   <BRK> a one seed s first round loss in the men s ncaa tournament wa unprecedented  so there wa no precedent for coping  coach bennett did his best to help   <BRK>  at a church service i attended  the pator talked about this idea of  trembling courage over meaured cowardice   i like that   bennett say   i want to let the guy know  it s ok to have doubt  it s ok to be anxious at time  you can be that way and still pursue all that you are worth  a long a you know that you can live with whatever come your way  success or failure  that wa a great lesson in lat year s situation   you are still ok  and we will still go after it   <BRK> before each game  guy walk out  crouch at mid court  and say a prayer  he look at the crowd around him  taking it all in  the fan  the heckler  the light  the camera   an atmosphere of adrenaline and expectation   <BRK>  i chase the high  for sure   guy say   but not adrenaline  like i need to jump off the cliff  more utopian    <BRK> playing at home against towson university on nov     guy missed several open jump shot in the game s early minute  during a first half timeout  despite the cavalier  lead  his expression wa a grimace of frustration  he finished the game with only five point    <BRK> five day later  a fifth ranked uva faced george wahington university  guy wa rejuvenated  with four minute to play in the first half  he drove to the baket  split two defender  and nailed a reverse lay up  a the crowd cheered  he grinned toward uva s bench  shrugging his shoulder with a steph curry esque  i don t know how that happened either  expression  guy and fellow backcourt starter ty jerome scored   point apiece  accounting for more than half of uva s total offense  <BRK> guy dominated in the cavalier  final non conference game before acc play  setting career high in point      three pointer      and rebound     in a   point win over marshall  <BRK> the challenge and triumph of uva s redemptive seaon have meant accepting that his baketball journey is no longer his own  there s no fix for the fact that so many people have invested their emotion into how he and the cavalier perform  but he can help himself a best he can   <BRK>  since lat year wa so rough for me  i approached this year

pressure  guy ha found himself in a much better place  including being more open with his family and close friend   <BRK>  i wish that there wa this one big moment for me  but there wan t   guy say   it took a lot of hard work  and the people around me helping me through it  the more i stayed in a routine and made mistake with it  the more i learned about how i wa going to cope with it  and it gradually got better  i haven t had a panic attack in a very long time  i m thankful  and i m happy that i figured it out    <BRK> early in the season  guy considered posting a third facebook entry  he wrote it  jenkins edited again  but the day before posting  jenkins questioned his intent   are you posting this for you  or for other people   jenkins asked   because if you are doing this  it should be for you   and no one else   he decided not to post it  <BRK> now  guy record his thought in a journal  both handwritten and on his computer  if he want to post or check on his social medium

one seems to know how to let it go  so we might a well relish the moment  i don t really care who s in the stand   <BRK> he admits that his response would have been much different a year ago  <BRK>  i
