antonio brown and the steelers appear to be parting way and everyone is trying to work out how it got to this point  after extensive research i believe i ve uncovered the root of the problem   brown wa on the cover of madden   <BRK> see  most people are pointing to declining steelers  production  an aging team  and a growing rift with quarterback ben roethlisberger  i think all these are fine explanation  but they ignore the clear and obvious fact that brown wa on the cover of madden  <BRK> doing a close reading of the cover it becomes obvious that there wa trouble in paradise  one might mistake brown s expression for one of adulation  but what if it isn t  the all pro wide receiver is surrounded by yellow  enveloped by it   trying desperately to shine despite having the ever pervasive shade of his team surround him  this is not a look of happiness  but one of agony  realizing he cannot escape the steelers  <BRK>

   <BRK> brown wa still one of the best receiver in the nfl in    posting yet another     yard season  but he toiled away joylessly  feeling his talent were unappreciated he hid away  withdrew  and went under the radar  <BRK> i don t know when they filmed the masked singer  but brown performing bobby brown s  my prerogative  wa astonishingly apt considering the issue he wa having with the steelers in     <BRK> everybody s talkin  all this stuff about me  now now why don t they just let me live  oh oh oh i don t need permissionmake my own decision  oh that s my prerogative <BRK> so here you have a man  driven by a lack of attention and respect out of college  still being doubted despite being one of the best in the league  and feeling trapped in a situation he had to get out of  sure  a lot of people give brown credit in his own right   but just a many continue to credit roethlisberger for  making  brown  which partially kicked this whole thing off in the first place  <BRK> the madden cover didn t cause brown to become unhappy with the steelers  it revealed his unhappiness to him  now  normally the madden curse is resigned to injury  poor performance or a combination of both   but this year s is perhaps the greatest curse leveraged  the once of self realization   <BRK> so brown  staring at himself on the cover of madden    see that oppressive yellow overshadowing him  see his situation and feel claustrophobic  what doe someone do when they feel like this  well  if you re an nfl player you likely look to others for advice  follow in their footstep   and who better than a newly minted hall of famer to fuel that  <BRK> the madden   hall of fame edition  is an upgraded copy of madden    brown saw terrell owen on the cover  wearing a cowboy uniform and saw a man who started his career on a team where he wa beloved  made a change and said  that could be me    <BRK> owen played for the  er for eight season  brown with the steeler for nine   <BRK> owen averaged     yard and     tdsbrown averaged     yard and     tds  <BRK> then you realize that brown and owen have been in contact  with brown specifically asking for his advice  we re through the looking glass here  people  <BRK> the tl dr is this  brown wa put on the cover of madden   and realized that the steelers weren t right for him anymore  seeking help  he looked at the cover of madden   hall of fame edition  saw owen and said  if t o  can do it  i can too    <BRK> also he sang a song dressed like a hippo   <BRK> the madden curse is real  and it s terrifying  <BRK>
