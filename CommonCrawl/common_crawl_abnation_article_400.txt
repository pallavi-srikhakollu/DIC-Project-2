freddie kitchen only ha eight game of experience a a coordinator in either the college or pro rank  so when he earned the chance to take the rein a the brown   th head coach in the pat   year  he made sure to surround himself with experienced talent in the latest effort to rebuild the league s most snakebitten franchise <BRK>and he s done a pretty great job with it <BRK>kitchen  simultaneously an off the radar hire and a man who can stay the course of cleveland s late season success  ha helped assemble a coaching staff capable of filling the gap on his resume with nfl experience  he s loaded his top assistant position with respected hand who can help quiet the doubt that come with interaction like this <BRK> wa i ready to be a head coach  i don t know  were you ready to be a parent    brown head coach freddie kitchen pic twitter com lapg oo sj<BRK>proud papa kitchen ha drafted up a supporting cast of caretaker to assuage concern across cleveland  his two top coordinator bring experience and an aggressive style who won t just elevate the brown  but also make them one of the most exciting team to watch  here s why  <BRK>monken s background a an air raid style offensive coordinator should have earned him plenty of head coaching consideration in a league that just promoted kliff kingsbury from     texa tech coach to the arizona cardinal  top guy  instead  he wa swept out with deposed tampa head coach dirk koetter  fielded a couple interview with no real significant interest  and wa left with oc offer across the league <BRK>he landed in cleveland  where he ll have the chance to use the brown a a stepping stone to a potential job top in     and that s a good thing  <BRK>monken will upgrade from juggling jameis winston and ryan fitzpatrick to engineering a game plan for   offensive rookie of the year frontrunner baker mayfield in cleveland  and if he can translate any of his success in tampa  it should lead to big gain for the second year quarterback  monken oversaw the league s third most prolific offense last fall   the buccaneer averaged     yard per game   despite having no reliable running game whatsoever <BRK>monken won t be calling the play for the brown   that duty will remain with kitchen  whose spread the wealth philosophy elevated mayfield s game to new height over the last half of the season  that s similar to the role he filled in tampa under koetter  who also called play for the bucs  he ll still be a trusted consigliere for the man who earned his spin on cleveland s coaching carousel thanks to his proven success in northeastern ohio <BRK>that kitchen monken pairing ha general manager john dorsey   the guy who turned the pick former gm sashi brown accumulated into a cache of dynamic young player   excited about his team s future <BRK> todd is very creative with a lot of his offensive package stuff   said dorsey after the team announced it suite of coaching hire   i would love to sit in that meeting on monday  tuesday  wednesday  just watch them install a game plan  cause they re both very creative  <BRK>but if the brown can t outrun opponent in a collection of   boat race  they ll have a shot at dragged opponent into the mud and beating them in low scoring slopfests  too <BRK>first thing first  wilks  run a the cardinal  head coach wa a disater  he had nothing to offer rookie quarterback josh rosen in his first seaon a a pro  his offense wa unwatchable  and the team wa so bad it had all pro cornerback patrick peterson searching for an exit in the run up to the trade deadline <BRK>wilks wasn t able to turn a defense that included peterson  chandler jones  and the rest of a depleted roster into a top squad  his cardinal were great at stopping big play and awful at pretty much everything else <BRK>but wilks is still the respected defensive mind that earned a shot at arizona s top job in the first place  he rose through the rank in the nfl after a decade plus in the ncaa  building and eventually commanding the panther  defense in     a resurgent year for a franchise that typically alternate good season with terrible one  wilks  ability to bring consistent quarterback pressure through a variety of blitz package is a sought after commodity in a league that s leaning more and more on it passing game <BRK>that s an area where his cardinal actually thrived  ranking third in the league in sack rate on blitz down         his   panther defense ranked third in the nfl when it came to overall sack rate a well  those number aren t part of a small sample size  either  wilks dialed up blitz on more than    of his play over the pat two year <BRK>with myles garrett providing pressure on the edge and larry ogunjobi crumpling pocket from the inside out  wilks will have a solid  young bae from which to work  expect the brown to be more aggressive on defense than they were in     and expect another all pro seaon from garrett a a result <BRK>cleveland pried stump mitchell from the jet to serve a the team s running back coach  he d previously served the same role in new york  with uneven return  while he wa able to turn former brown isaiah crowell into a dangerous  dynamic back  the jet were predictably ineffective on the ground in his two seaons with todd bowles  hiring the former nfl back reunites him with kitchen  the pair served on the same staff under bruce arians with the cardinal from   to   <BRK>he ll replace ryan lindley  who move from rb coach to quarterback coach  this move make lot of sense  but mostly because lindley had seven career rushing yard and     pasing yard in four seaon a an nfl qb  lindley s resume is thin   he spent the two seaon before taking the brown  job in   a a san diego state graduate asistant   but he helped hone cleveland s tailback into a group that had much more of an impact in the pasing game a the seaon wore on  <BRK>tyler tettleton  who spent two year a a graduate asistant at oklahoma while mayfield wa slinging touchdown pases and winning a heisman trophy  is an offensive quality control coach  former viking special team coach mike priefer  who previously served a multiple game suspension in minnesota for making homophobic remark  will hold the same title in cleveland <BRK>kitchen  staff ha a handful of young ish  rising assistant  but it s mostly filled with veteran coordinator and position coach who can provide a powerful cantilever to support the head coach s lack of top level experience  guy like monken and tettleton are there to take mayfield s meteoric development in   and add an extra gear to his top speed  wilks will have the chance to rebuild his reputation after one failed season in arizona by commanding one of the league s most talented young defense   even if that unit han t figured out how to turn potential into performance <BRK>freddie wanted  a thorough search    he wanted to compete and win the job  even though my daughter had to show me how to do the power point  <BRK>and that s great  because for all kitchen  on field success to close out    he absolutely need an experienced support staff to smooth off some of the rougher edge that will alienate some fan and make others absolutely    <BRK>hc freddie kitchen say he wa a brown fan growing up in alabama  on sunday  you had to do something other than go to church or eat a lot  <BRK>love    <BRK>kitchen said he wanted to wear the dawg pound hoodie  but pr wouldn t let him  they didn t want him in the ballcap either  but he won that battle  brown sport coat  orange tie  brown ballcap  http   t co bxzdtsqoc <BRK>him <BRK>hiring monken and wilks isn t just a hedge  it s good business  kitchen ha a talented  proven pairing at his coordinator position  and that s got the brown in position for their first playoff berth since    or  in other word  for the brown to stop being the brown   at least for the foreseeable future <BRK>
