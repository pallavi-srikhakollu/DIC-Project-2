the pga tour season never really end  there may be a few week it go into hibernation around the holiday  but that s it  the  season  now wrap around two different year and just go on and on with playing opportunity available for it member almost year round  <BRK>there are a few categorical section we can discern in the constant march  there are different  swing  such a the florida swing or hawaii swing and then there is  of course  the all important  playoff  at the end  which will now come before labor day and avoid being swallowed whole by football  we are now entering the west coat swing  the annual five week stretch in california and arizona that may just be the best cluster on the entire schedule  it is definitely the best  <BRK>there s no major championship snapping the sport world s attention to golf and most of the country is frozen thinking about football and basketball  but this stretch includes the tour s best run of venue  field  and tradition  the west coast swing ha it all  even if you re not fully paying attention to golf yet  it also mark the return of tiger wood  who annually come back to the tour at torrey pine and will do so again in   <BRK>here s your schedule for this year <BRK>with such a nice  delineated portion of the schedule to examine  we decided to kick around a few topic and potential discussion point for the next five week  it s a great stretch for the pga tour  even if you re not exactly ready to jump headfirst into the golf season <BRK>brendan  riviera  this is the best stretch on the schedule  in my opinion  and there are multiple great event  but the answer to this will always be riviera  it is one of the rare venue on the pga tour rota that is worth a pilgrimage  in the same way you might go visit a famous venue in another sport  such a wrigley field or lambeau field  it s that good  you re dropped in a canyon in the middle of los angeles that boats one of the great clasic course in the country  also  the field continues to be absolutely loaded  every top player from across the world want to come to the only stop in la and now that tiger s foundation is hosting it  they get the tiger bounce too  this is the pga tour s best event  even including the player <BRK>kyle  scottsdale  baby  you can have your traditionalism at riv  that s fine  it s a good event  the people s open is and will always be exactly what i want a modern golf tournament to look like  it is loud and stupid and boorish and gauche and there s a music festival on site  it s an event  not a golf tournament   and the pomp and circumstance     of lot of   year old mutual fund wholesaler named chad getting drunk in a desert is something i can t pas up  i m making my first pilgrimage this year <BRK>oh  and yeah  the finish are usually great even if   hole of the course are rather forgettable  <BRK>brendan  i think tiger make the cut at torrey  finish around  th  and then miss the cut at riviera  it s been awhile since we saw him in competition and he didn t exactly light it up after his tour championship win  i think he begin the year easing his way into it and torrey is not exactly a perfect fit for his game anymore  despite his saying it fit his eye  he s never done well at riviera  where bomber have a distinct advantage  tiger will try to whale away and get caught up in the sycamore and eucalyptus  i so  so bad want him to show out at riviera and light it up in la but i don t think it happens this year  he s going to get some rep with an eye on augusta <BRK>kyle  my expectation are honestly through the floor low  i m expecting a bit of a regression from that tour championship mania to start this year  surely we flew too close to the sun in   with the near miss at birkdale and bellerive  and the win at east lake  right  cat s had a long layoff  looked somewhat shaky in both the match and hero world challenge  you hit on all of his struggle at riv  and i ll agree that aging tiger isn t built for torrey s milquetoast length anymore  i ll go cut cut to start the year  though i don t think it ll be anything worth extrapolating too much from  it s golf  form fluctuates  he ll be fine <BRK>brendan  i don t think anyone absolutely ha to play well  it s the first quarter of the seaon and what happens in february can mean little for april through july  but jordan spieth sure could use some positive round  i think he is the one player most in the crosshairs at the start of the year and his comment at the sony open did little to instill confidence that he s close to figuring it out  he sounded lost and even resigned at time  he ha added torrey pine to the schedule for the first time in a few year  and ha won at pebble beach  where he always show up to shake hand a the title sponsor s golden boy  if he miss every cut until march  i still think he can show up to augusta and win with his game in shamble and complete trah of a statistical profile  but every round and meeting with the press he ha until then won t be particularly carefree if he bomb on the west coat swing  <BRK>kyle  thought exercise  i m going to ask you to rattle off a list of   something pga tour pro that have won exactly one time on tour in the last three season  seem difficult  impossible  of course it is  that list contains a bunch of just  uh  guy   and also rickie fowler <BRK>that s right  one of america s biggest golf  star  ha the same number of tour win a aaron baddeley and ted potter  jr  over the lat three seaons  he s now    he ha four career pga tour win  yes  he contends  yes  he s an elite level talent  but  how long are we going to keep this up  at what point do you just become chris kirk with a motocross bike <BRK>winning at riv or in scottsdale won t get the burden off rick s back  but what it might do is warm up a bit of confidence upstairs if he find himself in contention at a major in    is this the year he finally break through at the wmpo after near miss each of the last three year <BRK>brendan  can i interest you in a steve marino comeback arc   no  ok  well i am interested in this  i did a double take when i saw him in the field at the sony and it appears marino is in relatively good enough health and shape to play a full pga tour schedule here at the top of the year  he s on the field list for the desert classic  torrey pine  phoenix open  and pebble pro am  that s a damn full run for marino  who is a bit of an off course legend and everyman that i would love to see pop again on the pga tour  we need more character <BRK>brendan  the obvious and correct answer here is jose de jesus rodriguez  the   year old mexican with the most triumphant story of getting to the pga tour in the league s history  it s a damn inspiration and everyone should be rooting for the rookie to get a win on this west coast swing to lock up a spot in the master  but outside of that obvious choice  i ll go with chris thompson  the   year old rookie that go completely against the trend of the modern game  thompson may not bubble with personality and he s exactly the kind of rookie the tour doe not want to promote  they want the   year old that hit it   yard  there are dozen of those robot coming to plug in to the latest live under par ad  so for now  i ll watch and root for thompson to make some noise on the most competitive tour in the world <BRK>kyle  sorry  yell at me  fine  i know the cool and hot thing to do is lament the effect of drivebots on today s game  but i will mainline all the cam champ you can possibly supply me  i m all in on a freakish athlete who fly the ball mile pat other long hitter on tour  especially one with a backstory a interesting a champ s  he s already won once this year  and i ll be more surprised if it doesn t happen again this year <BRK>brendan  i am very into that  too  i wa just looking for some non champ answer  he will be awesome to watch  especially at these venue <BRK>brendan  i am verrrry worried that the suffocating mainstream golf medium is going to choke the joy out of following hosung choi  if they haven t already done so  choi will be a treat to watch at pebble beach  the one story i am already sick of is putting with the pin still in the cup  that s going to continue to get lot of love a cbs join the broadcat fray and more and more fan tune in for the first time this year  i m over it  it s fine and cool and let s move on from talking about the new rule <BRK>kyle  bryson  i m tired of bryson  the bit is old  i m tired of the putting with the pin in  i m tired of the carefully crafted pseudoscience used to develop brand power for cobra puma  i m tired of the driving range mental breakdown that are sure to come  i m tired of the  well  christ had hater too  attitude toward anyone who dare doubt his transparent grift in the name of physic  i beg you to get this man off my television  until someone finally asks his thought on global warming during a press conference <BRK>brendan  yes  despite his spicy commentary and gruff exterior  i think johnny is an emotional softie and this is the end of a legendary run  also  remember when he oddly got choked up talking about keegan bradley at the end of last year s bmw championship  that wa one of the weirder and more unexpected turn of the   season <BRK>kyle  no  absolutely not  i present you this quote on why he made phoenix his last stop  via golf digest <BRK> i wa always known a the  desert fox   my best golf  besides that final round at oakmont  came in the desert  especially in   when i won by   shot in phoenix and by nine shot in tucson  i wa playing at a level of golf those two week a good or better than i ve ever seen anyone hit the ball  <BRK>emotion and reflection requires self awareness  of which john ha none  we d have him no other way <BRK>brendan  jordan spieth doe not make a cut on the west coast swing and someone proclaims he is completely washed  phil mickelson win in phoenix  and in keeping with tradition  doe so in a playoff against hideki matsuyama that run into the halftime show of the super bowl <BRK>kyle  cam champ win again before we head to florida  and a whole bunch of people throw way  way too much money on him at the superbook before we get to augusta <BRK>
