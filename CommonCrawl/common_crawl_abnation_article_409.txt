in her biggest decision since taking over the pelican eleven month ago  gayle benson relieved longtime general manger dell demps of his duty friday  in doing so  she marked the earnest beginning of a new era of new orleans ownership   <BRK> when benson initially took over following the death of her late husband  the pelican were flying high  the team wa just starting to come together on the court for what would be a blazing hot finish to the season that saw the pelican advance to the second round of the playoff   <BRK> given the success of the prior season  it wa no surprise that benson decided to stick with demps to see if he could finally turn the pelican into a consistent winner  fast forward eleven month and it s clear he could not  culminating in the exhaustively covered anthony davis trade request  now benson stand on the door step of what could eventually turn her into the most powerful woman in sport  <BRK>  rd nfl franchise <BRK> one familiar motif amongst many sport pundit before the ad trade request ha been the idea that the saint take precedent over the pelican in the mind of ownership  the current saga ha only furthered that notion  while there is definitely some truth to that line of thought a every corporation allocates more resource to larger business unit a opposed to smaller one  i think there is a bit more nuance to the situation than that   <BRK> the seed for this this perception were planted right at the beginning of the benson tenure  tom benson purchased the pelican from the nba in   and immediately placed loomis in charge of his new acquisition  of course the idea of putting a  football guy  in charge of an nba franchise wa head scratching  but given deeper thought it made perfect sense given the totality of the situation  <BRK> prior to her death a few year ago  my grandmother suffered from dementia  in her case it wa a slow and painful decline in which she slowly lost her prized mental faculty that had helped her become a successful black female entrepreneur in the segregated jim crow south   something she wa proud of until her final day  in watching the benson situation with the pelican unfold  i saw several parallel with my grandmother that i feel gave me a greater insight into the early decision made by new orleans ownership   <BRK> the interesting thing about many of our elder a they decline is that they know it happening  they know they should remember your name  they know you are an important figure in their life but they can t quite place you all the time  this is very frightening because they fully understand how vulnerable they are in that state and yet  except for a few intermittent moment of clarity  they are powerless to stop it  consequently  the group around people in this situation begin to shrink  only the most trusted advisor are allowed in  people who wouldn t take advantage of you even if they could  <BRK> this wa true for my grandmother a well a she would only discus issue of money with my mother  who wa her caretaker for the final decade of her life  while she loved all of her five child  she didn t trust them with sensitive information because quite frankly they weren t in the trench with her everyday  they weren t taking her to doctor appointment  leaving work early to check on her  or making sure she got exercise  thus  it didn t surprise me that tom benson selected valued and trusted longtime advisor mickey loomis to head his newly purchaed franchise  tom benson knew all to well of the legal battle that wa coming and knowing that he couldn t manage a much a he used to he wanted someone that he could trust above all else   <BRK> this explanation doesn t make the original management structure of the benson pelican optimal  but from the perspective of a business man with declining health in the midst of a bitter estate battle it make complete sense  however  that period in franchise history is over and it is time to look forward and begin operating like a regular nba entity  <BRK> pelican first <BRK>  th century banker baron rothschild wa once said   the time to buy is when there s blood in the street   rothschild wa in many way one of the forefather of the modern banking system and his quote express an investment philosophy that is still coveted by modern investor  that concept say the very best time to invest in something is when everyone hate it  when no one ha anything good to say about it  and it s unthinkable to the outside world that the situation could ever get better  people like warren buffett credit this investment philosophy with helping them attain some of the largest fortune ever amassed  <BRK> doe that description of the  blood on the street  metaphor remind you of anything   <BRK> of course  try our lowly lovable pelican  scan the national television or print medium and you ll hardly find a soul who is willing to mention a single redeemable quality about new orleans  there is no doubt that the pelican haven t done everything correctly over the year  but to portray them a dumpster fire   only alvin gentry s use of the term when talking about the anthony davis trade fiaco   is hyperbole and often portends the general ignorance of the pundit in question  <BRK> however  if we were sitting down with baron rothschild  he would likely be considering on making a bid for the pelican  thankfully they re not for sale so owner gayle benson ha a real chance to put her mark on this franchise  to be honest  the pelican  not the saint  are her chance to leave a lasting impression on new orleans  the saint are a well oiled machine  mickey loomis and sean payton are saint lifer  and with a young team that look poised for future success  don t expect the cast to be leaving town anytime soon   <BRK> when gayle walk around the saint facility  everyone she see wa hired and or mentored by tom benson  while we can be sure she love all of these folk greatly  everything involving saint leadership is about the legend  real or perceived  of  good ole mr  b   no  it is with the floundering pelican that gayle can really make her mark   <BRK> with the dismissal of longtime general manager dell demps  mr  benson is ready to begin the process of building her own legacy   <BRK> within a few short month  key personnel leading the pelican organization will have been interviewed and hired by gayle benson  surely  others will help her make important decision  but the new general manager and his or her subsequently hired staff will answer to mr  b   she will ultimately be held responsible for future success or failure  because of this dynamic  i think the truth about gayle benson s allegiance to her sport franchise may ultimately end up being the inverse of how they are currently perceived  think about it  don t you take more pride in thing that you have built yourself over something that is just handed to you  <BRK> future pelican management won t have any old story about what tom did for them or how instrumental he wa in their career  they  likely  won t have picture in their office of tom doing his trademark off rhythm umbrella dance  they won t go on and on about the valuable business lesson he taught them  i m sure gayle loved hearing these story  but i m also sure she want to write some of her own  while the saint will always be important to her   after all  they are a freaking cash cow  only in turning around the pelican can she truly separate herself from the family name   <BRK> a relatively quick pelican turnaround would change the openly misogynistic view of her a  just tom benson s widow  and into the most powerful woman in sport a one of only two individual who owns a team in both the nfl and nba  establishing herself a a power player in the sport world would benefit both franchise and unlock unique opportunity presented by owning two major sport franchise  i m not saying that success is guaranteed  but i am saying we need to give her a chance   <BRK> dismiss people who view her only a  the widow    a ringer ceo bill simmons referred to her repeatedly on his podcat   and those who express skepticism about her decision making  first  we haven t seen her make any big decision prior to firing dell demps so it s too early to even make that judgement  second  we all know why they are so unsure  no one expressed concern when the york family turned the san francisco  er over to then   year old jed york  similarly  no one expressed concern when al davis pased away and left the team to his son   not unrelated  the raider a of this writing still do not know where they will play next seaon   <BRK> gayle benson doesn t deserve a pa  but like all of u  she only deserves a chance  a chance to prove that she can be the owner the pelican need her to be  i can t see inside of her brain  i can t envision the future  but i can read the tea leaf  and if mr  benson is a smart a i think she is  she will too   <BRK> every time she walk into the super dome  mr  b walk past the towering status of her late husband  if gayle benson is to ever have a statue erected in her honor  it should probably be placed outside of the smoothie king center  <BRK>
