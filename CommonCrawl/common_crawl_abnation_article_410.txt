linebacker vontaze burfict is exactly what every nfl team wanted from a middle linebacker about   or   year ago  player like dick butkus and jack lambert had reputation a mean and scary enforcer who didn t just make tackle  but attempted to set the tone for anybody who dared to go to the middle of the field  <BRK> highlight reel showed clothesline tackle  helmet to helmet hit  and boasted about the rough and tough linebacker of lore  <BRK> but the best linebacker of football today are those who can channel the aggression and violence of the game without crossing the line  that s something that burfict ha struggled with  <BRK> in seven nfl season with the cincinnati bengal  burfict     racked up over      million in career fine and forfeited pay  in march    after unsuccessful attempt to trade burfict  the bengal released the linebacker  he wa only a free agent for a day  which is surprising   largely because his play ha dropped off  but also because of his reckless play  the raider signed him to a one year deal and in oakland  he ll be teammate with someone he ha bad history with  antonio brown  <BRK> many of his biggest punishment came against brown and one of the bengal  biggest rival  the pittsburgh steelers  burfict seems to dial up his recklessness to another level against them  <BRK> his most recent infraction came against the steelers  his second game back after a four game suspension  this time the league is reviewing a series of hit  but the one that stand out is the elbow he delivered to antonio brown s head during a tackle   <BRK> it ended up being costly for burfict  <BRK> source   bengal lb vontaze burfict wa fined      for multiple play that constituted unnecessary roughness in week   game against pittsburgh  including the play involving the steelers  antonio brown      in  rd quarter  and james conner      in  rd quarter   <BRK> pittsburgh quarterback ben roethlisberger said after the game that burfict wa also threatening juju smith schuster  telling the steelers receiver  you re next  while the two team were lined up before the snap   <BRK> it wa reminiscent of perhaps his most egregious run in with the steelers  when he drew a massive      fine in december   for a combination of two unsportsmanlike conduct penalty and a hit on ben roethlisberger in a loss to the steelers  a month later  burfict wa suspended three game for a helmet to helmet hit on antonio brown in the playoff that concussed the wide receiver  <BRK> the nfl informed burfict during the week that another move like this one could get him suspended   <BRK> but burfict s lengthy history of rash play go way beyond the afc north rivalry  <BRK> the top two recruit in the state of california on just about everyone s ranking for the clas of   were burfict and mater dei quarterback matt barkley  the pair of five star prospect met for game against each other a both junior and senior  and it certainly appeared a though burfict aimed to hit barkley in the knee in one of those game  <BRK> year later  barkley held a grudge over burfict s play in high school and accused him of attempting to injure him  <BRK>  he s a dirty player   barkley told the los angeles time before the two were set to meet in a game in college   his switch is always on  and it s not a good switch   <BRK> burfict s targeting of barkley especially raised eyebrow because both player were committed to usc  the linebacker later made a last second switch to arizona state on national signing day  <BRK> burfict quickly developed a reputation for being a destroyer of world at asu  in his first college game  burfict demolished idaho state quarterback russell hill  and a couple of week later  he made a pair of huge stop against no    georgia late in the game   <BRK> the second stop wa an impressive dive over the line of scrimmage on fourth down that came right after burfict shoved the ref and almost gave up a free first down  <BRK> burfict finished the year with pac   defensive freshman of the year honor  but he quickly developed a reputation for personal foul  by midseason  he wa already told to rein it in after drawing three personal foul in an october game against wahington   <BRK>  he got carried away   asu coach dennis erickson told the arizona republic   that s how he is  but he s got to control it  i love his intensity  i don t want to slow his intensity down because it s contagious for the rest of the player  for the fan and for everybody involved in the program  but he s got to be smart  and i know he will   <BRK> he never got around to being smart  burfict kept on crushing opposing player and drawing personal foul every step of the way  even in practice  burfict wa a problem  <BRK>  there were more practice fight in vontaze s year than i ve seen in  current coach  todd graham s entire four year at au   chris karpman of sun devil source told the press enterprise in january   i think in the first week after he d been cleared academically a a freshman  he wa in a fight every day of practice that following week   <BRK> sporting news dubbed burfict  the meanest man in college football  in    but erickson wa forced to bench the linebacker a few time   sometime unsuccessfully  <BRK>  i know one thing   oregon state coach mike riley told sporting news   somebody is taking a blow every play  burfict is  on the field   <BRK> burfict entered the   nfl draft after his junior season  finishing his collegiate career with   personal foul in   game with the sun devil   <BRK> despite first team all american honor a a sophomore in    burfict s declining play a a junior  concern about his lack of discipline  a failed drug test at the nfl combine  and poor testing time all combined to boot him from the   nfl draft entirely  <BRK>  i watched three tape and really didn t like him a a football player   nfl network s mike mayock said a week before the draft   i think he s a nondraftable kid  for me  he s a free agent   <BRK> the bengal scooped up burfict a a free agent  and it immediately paid off with the rookie starting   game and leading the team in tackle with    the bengal finished no    in total defense but allowed     more yard per play when burfict wa off the field  yet  he managed to go the whole year without a fine  <BRK> he earned a    million extension in    but burfict reverted to his former self  racking up personal foul and fine that have since come to define his play  despite the fact that he s one of the nfl s better linebacker  <BRK> burfict got his first fine in the nfl for hitting green bay packer tight end ryan taylor in a not so nice place   <BRK> taylor wa penalized during the game  but the nfl gave burfict a      fine after replay showed what made taylor so mad in the first place  <BRK> burfict also received a      fine in the same game for a hit on james jones that drew a flag because the packer receiver wa deemed defenseless  <BRK> burfict made up for it later in the game when he told bengal defensive coordinator mike zimmer to change a play call on the final drive of the game  <BRK>  he wanted to call one play and i said   coach  that s not going to work   burfict told bengal com   let s just go base and hopefully we get  aaron  rodgers to start scrambling and we plaster their guy and it worked   <BRK> rodgers threw a pas on fourth down that wa tipped by bengal defensive end michael johnson  sealing a     win for the bengal  <BRK> official called three   yard penalty on burfict in a game against the buffalo bill  but he only received a      fine for a facemask on running back fred jackson     <BRK> burfict earned another      fine about a month later when he speared new york jet wide receiver stephen hill with his helmet  it upped his   fine total to        a huge chunk of his modest      base salary in the second year of his undrafted contract  <BRK> the only fine of the   season for burfict wa a      penalty for twisting the ankle of both carolina panther quarterback cam newton and panther tight end greg olsen  <BRK> both newton and olsen dealt with ankle injury earlier in the season  and olsen argued that burfict should be suspended for his action  <BRK>  in instance like that that are so clearly premeditated  that he had in his mind that if he had those opportunity that he wa going to try to attack guy  leg  but guy who are coming off ankle problem specifically  there s no room for it   olsen told the charlotte observer   <BRK>  guy like that don t learn from that stuff  he s been fined   time for head hunting and he did it to  panther receiver  kelvin  benjamin  again   <BRK> benjamin suffered a concussion on the final play from scrimmage for the panther when burfict hit him  but the tackle did not draw a flag  <BRK> burfict s bad blood with the steelers really boiled over in a week   game between two team jockeying for a playoff position  the linebacker made a tackle on running back le veon bell that forced him to have season ending knee surgery  and player on the steelers   including offensive lineman ramon foster   said that burfict celebrated the injury  <BRK>  if you re on the field with him  you know what i mean by that   foster said  via chris adamski of the pittsburgh tribune review   they ll play it off  he ll act dumb about it  but you don t run across the field hyped  celebrating  jumping up and down when a guy go down like that   <BRK> after the game  burfict insisted he didn t celebrate the injury and said he s friend with bell off the field  <BRK> at the next meeting between the team  burfict and james harrison got after each other in pregame warm ups  but that wa just the beginning of the feud between the team  <BRK> burfict earned fine for three separate play   two unnecessary roughness penalty and a hit low on roethlisberger   totaling       the hit on roethlisberger drew the most attention a it appeared the linebacker made an effort to dive at the quarterback s knee  although burfict said he wa pushed  <BRK>  he said  i got pushed into you  my bad    roethlisberger told     the fan two day later   i turned my phone on afterwards and one of the text i got from a former player and a friend of mine say   how is this not a fine or a penalty by burfict   and he showed me the clip of it  and since then i have seen the clip  and i don t buy that he wa pushed  you know  i think that he definitely wa diving in low and going for my leg   <BRK> the play did not draw a flag  but it wa still one of the three play that resulted in a huge fine for burfict  <BRK> year of burfict being a stellar linebacker  but also a player seemingly out for blood  culminated in a single game that seemed to be a microcosm of his entire football life   <BRK> first  burfict injured roethlisberger on a perfectly legal sack that forced the quarterback to be carted off the field  he eventually returned to the game  despite suffering a shoulder injury that seemed to clearly hinder his play  <BRK> then burfict appeared to seal the game for the bengal by intercepting a pas from landry jones with     remaining  seemingly icing the team s     lead   <BRK> but the bengal fumbled the ball right back to the steelers  and roethlisberger re entered the game with the chance to set up a game winning field goal  pittsburgh eventually got that field goal  and it wa due to a vicious  head hunting hit delivered by burfict on antonio brown that drew a   yard penalty  <BRK> a   yard penalty wa given to adam  pacman  jones in the chaos that followed  and the steelers hit a chip shot to win  burfict wa suspended three game for the hit that concussed brown and knocked him out of the steelers  next playoff game  <BRK> with roethlisberger dealing with a shoulder injury and brown out of action  the steelers lost     to the denver bronco  <BRK> after sitting out the first three game of the   season  burfict s first fine of the year came in the third game when he wa docked      for stomping on new england patriot running back legarrette blount  <BRK> fresh off a suspension for a reckless play  the hefty fine made sense given the linebacker s history  but it also seemed odd that it wouldn t draw another suspension for a player clearly on a short leash  <BRK> it also bear questioning if another player would have been punished  a replay seemed to show no stomp happened at all  <BRK> his next regular season fine came after he flipped double finger to the buffalo crowd in a week   loss to the bill  <BRK> video of  bengal lb vontaze  dirtfict  burfict giving the double middle finger to fan during  bill loss http   t co uqtkqlsdxv <BRK> burfict wa fined      for the middle finger  upping his mammoth career total  <BRK> in training camp  burfict started a brawl with his own team when he tackled running back gio bernard by diving at his knee  bernard had just resumed practicing again after recovering from his acl tear the year before   <BRK> in cincinnati s second preseason game  burfict took down chief fullback anthony sherman with a big hit while he wa running a passing route  the league ha a new rule against just such a move this season  and burfict wa suspended five game  but had the punishment reduced to three game after an appeal  <BRK> burfict wa ejected from a game against the titan for contact with an official  camera never showed what the interaction wa that got him tossed  but it came after a questionable late hit call that frustrated the linebacker  <BRK> he walked off the field holding up the money sign a la johnny manziel  burfict wasn t fined for the incident  <BRK> espn s adam schefter reported that burfict received a four game suspension for violating the nfl s performance enhancing drug policy  in april  he lost an appeal of the punishment and the suspension wa upheld  <BRK> after his return from suspension  it took burfict just two game to get back into trouble  three different tackle made by burfict against the steelers came under review by the nfl  including an elbow to the helmet of antonio brown   reminiscent of the hit in january   that created controversy  <BRK> he didn t receive another suspension for the hit  but he did get a      fine   the largest of his career  <BRK> in his seven season in the nfl  and even long before that  vontaze burfict ha toed the line between violent linebacker and out of control player with malicious intent   <BRK> his history a a repeat offender in the nfl already resulted in a suspension and ha upped his fine total to far beyond the number of the average nfl player  no other player is in jeopardy of serious ramification for a single personal foul  but burfict ha reached that point  <BRK> maybe in another era  burfict s disregard for the well being of his opponent would have been revered  but it ha meant trouble more often than not for the linebacker during his career  <BRK>  <BRK>
