the nfl s annual league meeting is the starting point for the rule that could change the game  every march  nfl owner and coach gather to discus the season that wa  the season that will be  and the potential tweak that can make the game fairer and or sand down any advantage the patriot may have gleaned the year prior   <BRK> the meeting is the genesis of idea like replay challenge  good   relaxed team celebration rule  good   the language that gave u catch that had to survive the ground  bad   and the language that kinda sorta cleared that mess up      ok   it serf a the jumping off point for reform that will earn hour of debate throughout the offseaon before either working their way into the rulebook  or being tabled until the rule committee or one enterprising team decides to broach the subject at the spring league meeting in may  <BRK> but it s not just a gathering to discus the rulebook  the confluence of coach and owner mean plenty of juicy gossip leak out of phoenix  last year we heard about everything from how much the ram  new stadium will cost to baker mayfield s pied piper potential  hee hee   to todd bowles  amazing defense of christian hackenberg  <BRK> bowles on hackenberg   he s a quarterback on our team   <BRK> this year s meeting wa supposed to take place from march      but the league wrapped it up by march     <BRK> here s everything that happened  starting with the big headliner  <BRK> the biggest proposal this week revolved around expanding the use of instant replay  primarily in response to the pas interference no call that cost the saint a spot in super bowl     <BRK> on tuesday  the league owner made a major change  that offensive and defensive pas interference call  including non call  are now subject to review during the   season  <BRK> a coach can challenge up until the final two minute of each half  and at that point  it s up to the replay booth to review it  team owner approved it by a margin of      the bengal were reportedly the dissenting vote   <BRK> under this new rule  which will be on a one year trial basis  the no call in the nfc championship and another in the super bowl would have been reviewed  interestingly enough  the original rule change up for debate this week wouldn t have included those  <BRK> however  a new proposal   the one that passed   wa added to the agenda tuesday  <BRK> per saint coach sean payton  competition committee ha agreed to a proposal that would allow coach challenge on play where offensive or defensive pas interference is not called  if it pases  that would address non call similar to the one in the saint ram nfc champ  <BRK> that s a clear victory for sean payton and the saint  who fought hard to get the rule changed  <BRK> pic twitter com cmtf dhqz <BRK> from the top   free agent  to mock draft  to scouting report  we ve got everything you need to get through the offseason  all in one place  <BRK> to start of the week  the discussion wa centered around whether or not to make penalty called on the field like interference  roughing the passer  and defenseless player foul reviewable   a distinction that could extend the running time of game but also ensure a call doesn t prematurely end a team s season   <BRK> there were initially two proposal on the table  the first would ve added pa interference penalty to the list of reviewable call  the second would ve also included pa interference  a well a other   yard personal foul like roughing the paer  <BRK>  the goal is to correct clear officiating error on impactful play   troy vincent  nfl s executive vice president of football operation said in an interview in advance of sunday s meeting   our credibility is on the line   <BRK> while vincent and the league s competition committee are receptive to change  some owner aren t  the steelers in particular came out against expanded replay in the run up to the debate  <BRK>  first of all  i would not want to see the length of the game be expanded   team president art rooney ii said in an interview released friday   one other thing i ll add to that is replay  at the end of the day  is another human being interpreting the play  while it can be helpful in a lot of case  when you start talking about judgment call   pas interference in particular   you re still putting another human being in a spot of having to make that decision  you re just never going to get it perfect  no matter how many people are looking at it   <BRK> in the end  a third version passed  after an impassioned defense from the coach  including     jason garrett   <BRK> stephen jones said garrett s speech made an impact and the competition ha changed it proposal that will present to the owner to vote on  the competition committee voted     on the new replay proposal  garret can rock the vote http   t co yd ciwn xo <BRK> while those motion came from the competition committee  a pair of proposal from team also sparked debate in arizona   <BRK> a motion from the chief aimed to change overtime rule to ensure both team posse the ball at leat once in the extra period   a proposal that come month after kansa city didn t get a chance to field it offense a the patriot ran away with a     overtime win in the afc title game   <BRK> their rule would also eliminate overtime in the preseason and eliminate the overtime coin toss  instead allowing the team who won the game opening toss to choose whether to receive the ball or defer  <BRK> this proposal didn t make it out of the committee in arizona  but it will be discussed when the league hold it annual spring meeting this may   so it s not completely licked yet  <BRK> another potential reform from the bronco would ve followed the aaf s lead and provided an alternative to the onside kick  with conversion at a historically low rate  denver s suggestion is to give team the option to convert a de facto fourth and   from their own   yard line immediately following a touchdown or field goal  if the scoring team can gain    yard  they retain possession of the ball  if not  the defending team take over wherever the ball is stopped  <BRK> a interesting a that would have been  the league decided it wan t ready for an onside kick replacement yet  denver s idea wa shot down tuesday afternoon  <BRK> kansa city s ot proposal wa tabled and denver s onside kick proposal wa defeated  i m told  <BRK> here were all the rule up for discussion  per the nfl  in all    playing rule  six bylaw  and two resolution were proposed   a third resolution from the eagle  which would have required the cowboy and lion to play their thanksgiving game on the road every other year  wa withdrawn    <BRK> by tuesday  a number of them had pased   seven rule  a well a all six bylaw and both resolution  <BRK> they re mostly unexciting tweak  but they include    <BRK> at today s annual meeting  owner voted to make permanent the kickoff rule change that were implemented in    the change resulted in a    reduction in

former steelers le veon bell and antonio brown  <BRK> tomlin on   and     i think it ha been highly chronicled and i think it ha been too chronicled  some thing have been said that may or may not have been true  all i know is neither one of those guy are member of our team anymore    theathleticpgh <BRK> and jon gruden s out here working his next level spy tactic to figure out how the upcoming

set to appear in court to contest those charge march     until he pleaded not guilty and the appearance wa cancelled  while he had reportedly been offered a diversionary program that would allow him to expunge those count in exchange for   hour of community service  participation in an educational program about the danger of sex trafficking  and a reimbursement of court cost  kraft appears dead
