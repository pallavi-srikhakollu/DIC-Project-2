judging the competence of those running the new orleans pelican is a fraught exercise  this is not a normal nba franchise in a normal nba market with normal line of history  a normal ownership situation  or a normal outlook  <BRK>dell demps  who wa fired a general manager of the pelican after eight seaons on friday  wa never in a normal situation  he wa hired by george shinn  a franchisee going broke  early in demps  tenure  there were legitimate fear around the league that the then hornet wouldn t be able to make payroll  those were tough time throughout the nba  owing to the great recession  this wa also before a franchise friendly labor deal in   and the explosion of t v  revenue in    <BRK>thing were so bad in new orleans that then commissioner david stern convinced himself and the other   nba franchisees to collectively bail out the disliked and dislikable shinn  purchae the team and let stern act a the steward until a new ownership group could be found  stern declared that he would let those already in charge of the franchise   including demps   run the team  <BRK>but according to multiple report over the multiple year the nba controlled the franchise  stern found the pull of power irresistible <BRK>stern famously vetoed the first chris paul trade demps put together  funnily enough with the lakers  the team ended up trading paul for a package centered around eric gordon  a player stern touted a someone new orleans could build around  unlike the veteran that demps had tried to acquire   another stern step in most people have forgotten  he reportedly prevented demps from offering gordon an early extension in the fall of    gordon s agent at the time  rob pelinka  who is now the general manager of the lakers   it s a small world   that following summer of    pelinka orchestrated an enormous offer sheet from the sun      million over four year   that demps and stern felt obligated to match  <BRK>for comparison s sake  the summer gordon signed that deal  the warrior got the better  healthier stephen curry to sign an early extension for    million over four year  new orleans botched that critical deal because david stern wa tying dell demps  hand <BRK>

  <BRK>within a couple year  stern had convinced the nfl s saint to essentially absorb the now pelican into their project  stern gave tom benson a sweetheart deal after blocking out of towner from making bid just a nba franchise value were beginning to explode  but new orleans wa a challenged market in the best of day due to certain revenue and facility deficiency  population in the city is still recovering from the tragic blow of hurricane katrina and it aftermath  <BRK>the nba saved pro basketball in new orleans  and also saddled it with year of instability owing to stern s reign and demps  failure to hit the jackpot again after drafting anthony davis   one could argue he did hit the jackpot with the demarcus cousin trade  but then watched the moneybag fall into a wormhole when cousin  tore his achilles   you can t blame stern for the instability without crediting him with saving the market from bidder who d move the team to seattle  san jose  or kansa city  you can t fault demps without acknowledging how abnormally tough his situation ha been <BRK>the story now emanating from new orleans is that gayle benson and saint gm mickey loomis fired demps in part due to the wackadoo situation thursday  where short timer anthony davis left the arena after a shoulder injury in the middle of a nationally televised game without anyone knowing that he wa going to get an mri  well  without anyone but demps knowing  demps apparently didn t forward the proverbial email  and coach alvin gentry had to answer the post game medium firestorm knowing nothing <BRK>

  <BRK>no one get fired just for that  and the pelic aints braintrust protest too much by claiming this had nothing to do with the lakers subterfuge mess  everything ha everything to do with everything  <BRK>it s an unfortunate if appropriate end to demps  long  odd reign in new orleans  you can t quite explain whether it s right or wrong  or what exactly is the reason for anything  or whether anyone should feel good or bad about it  it s a quiet little chaos  a tangle of shrug and hmphs  <BRK>this is the new orleans pelican  it s a real mess  but no one can quite explain succinctly how thing got this way  and certainly no one can really be blamed <BRK>except maybe george shinn  yeah  let s just blame george shinn  that guy  <BRK>
