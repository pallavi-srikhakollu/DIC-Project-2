uconn wa bad at football in    the husky had one of the worst defense in major college football history and finished  th out of   fbs team in s p   but a new report paint an even grimmer picture about the broader athletic department   <BRK> the university s   report to the ncaa on it financial situation is full of bad news  the athletic department brought in      million in revenue  but incurred a whopping      million in expense  it needed more than    million in  additional institutional support  and more than      million in student fee  that s all per the hartford courant  <BRK> one reason for rough financials  nobody is really going to the game  the hartford courant also reported that only about     fan a game actually showed up to watch uconn football last year  a continuation of a troubling trend over the last five year of husky football   <BRK> the math in these report can be a little fuzzy  but the fundamental here are hard to ignore  uconn s athletic department doesn t sell enough ticket or make enough from tv  conference distribution  license  and so forth to come close to sustaining it cost   <BRK> the husky  aac is approaching a new tv deal that should bring more money every year  but optimistically  that s an increase of      million per year  and it might come with giving up any chance to join a power conference in the near future   <BRK> the football team is still playing home game   mile from campus  while the husky have literally nowhere to go but up  they re year away from contention  their ceiling might be low  too  uconn s only major bowl appearance since   wa a fluky fiesta bowl appearance a a four loss team after    due to the big eat s bcs auto bid  that team lost by four touchdown to oklahoma and lost money making the trip   <BRK> the program s never won double digit game or finished in the ap top    heck  since    uconn s cracked the top   in s p  three time and never finished higher than  th  it average finish ha been  th  and it s been  th since the move to the aac   <BRK> in the aac  uconn s recruiting ha tanked so badly that harvard ha a better   class  in a region with few three star  let alone blue chip  how much better is uconn going to get  is it worth this much debt if a good season mean  oh      and a trip to the birmingham bowl   <BRK> the football team itself lost      million in    thanks in part to a a      million decline in ticket revenue  money is so tight that randy edsall paid out of his own pocket to give his offensive coordinator a raise  men s and woman s basketball  the school s flagship program  also lost million apiece  the school told the courant   <BRK>  the long term goal is obviously to move athletics closer to financial self sufficiency   uconn spokesperson stephanie reitz said in an email  noting that a recently a    the athletic department did not require a significant subsidy   in recent year  declining conference and medium licensing revenue  along with rising cost  have created the current deficit  it is not sustainable and the division of athletics is continually working to identify saving and drive up revenue in order to help close this gap   <BRK> it s not something many fan want to hear  but fbs football is really expensive  if you re not selling ticket  don t have a credible way to success  and have money problem  fcs could make a lot of sense  even for certain power   program  it s at least worth considering  <BRK> uconn would have option a an fcs program  the nec only ha seven team and would almost asuredly welcome uconn  who would have local opponent like sacred heart  central connecticut state  and bryant  plus a winnable league with an fcs playoff auto bid   <BRK> the caa  the successor to uconn s old league and now one of the best in fcs  already ha   team  but could perhaps be persuaded to take the husky back  that would pair uconn with other quality northeastern program like new hampshire and maine  either option would be more geographically contained than the sprawling aac  helping with travel cost   <BRK> dropping down a level shave cost in a variety of way  at least four aac school pay their head coach at least    million a year  while a good fcs head coach might make       with assistant in the low six figure or lower  <BRK> the school wouldn t be on the hook for a many football scholarship   a max of   in fcs  rather than   in fbs   and could spend le on the bloated administrative bureaucracy you need to recruit in fbs  and which edsall s criticized   uconn s football staff directory list   different people  for example  maine  which made the fcs semifinal lat year  list     <BRK> there would be some financial loss  too  a relatively small a the aac s tv deal and share of college playoff money are  they re bigger than their fcs equivalent  in the aac  uconn can make at leat      million to get slaughtered by clemson in a guarantee game  in fcs  the husky  aking price would go down several hundred grand   <BRK> it wouldn t close the deficit on it own  but if uconn returned to it old status a an fcs contender and sold more ticket  it could come a lot closer over time  especially because      <BRK> of course  uconn isn t really a football school  it s a basketball school  the men s team ha struggled after winning the   ncaa tournament  while certainly not the only factor  the aac move ha contributed to the program s decline  robbing it of road game in traditional northeastern recruiting territory  plus  selling ticket for game against tulane and east carolina is a lot harder than selling ticket for game against georgetown and villanova   <BRK> if uconn ditched the aac and parked basketball and other sport in the big east  not only would it be in a superior conference for both men s and woman s basketball  it d be reunited with program it used to play all the time in the old big east   the team many uconn fan actually care about   <BRK> that s an easier path to greatness  and a much easier path to ticket sale and money  and it s not like the big east wouldn t be interested in having the husky  uconn s other fast growing sport  hockey  isn t sponsored by the aac and shouldn t feel the effect of a move   <BRK> few athletic department in the six biggest fbs conference get a much in university subsidy a uconn s doe  few have harder road to football success  fbs football cost might still go up in the future  and revenue might not keep up  the school ha two other program with big fanbaes  successful history  and a potential landing spot fan would like  nobody like to drop a level  but sometimes  it s the right thing to do   <BRK> for more on the husky  <BRK>
