le veon bell ha made it clear he no longer want to play in pittsburgh  it took some convincing  but the steelers are finally ready to let him leave <BRK>steelers general manager kevin colbert confirmed that the team won t franchise or transition tag it former all pro tailback  clearing bell s final hurdle toward unrestricted free agency  that mean he ll be able to negotiate with any team willing to offer him the long term  big money contact he s sought since   once the nfl s official free agent period begin on march    <BRK>it also end his six year tenure in the steel city  something bell doesn t seem too wistful about <BRK>free at last  free at last  thank god almighty i am free at last       <BRK>pittsburgh had two option to retain it star running back without caving in to his contract demand  it could have used it franchise tag on him for a third straight season  though that would have been prohibitively expensive  franchising bell in   would have cost the team roughly      million   the average salary of the league s top five player  it also wouldn t have guaranteed bell s spot in the lineup  the veteran back eschewed      million in game check in   in order to sit out the season and set himself up for a   payday <BRK>the team also could have used it transition tag a a lat ditch effort to retain bell  though it likely wouldn t have had much of an impact  any team that would have wanted bell would just have to offer him the contract pittsburgh s been so reticent to give him in order to pry him away from the franchise <BRK>instead  the steelers will decline to use either unimpressive option in a decision that speaks to each side s irreconcilable difference  pittsburgh want bell in the lineup but not at his asking price  which is to be paid like a star running back and no    wide receiver all in one  bell want either the record setting contract he belief three all pro honor have earned him or the opportunity to seek it elsewhere  <BRK>now he ll get it  and hopefully find the recognition for which he s longed <BRK>it s just a great feeling when you re appreciated   isn t it   <BRK>bell sat out the entire   season in a move that wa equal part self preservation and protest  he d worked to secure a robust paycheck after his rookie contract expired in    but when the two side couldn t come to term he returned to pittsburgh under the team s franchise tag  that one year deal expired after the season  only for the steelers to tag bell once more when it became clear the club wouldn t meet his demand for a larger deal <BRK>that led to an extended holdout that saw the three time pro bowler forfeit      million in game check in the process  he also forfeited a bunch of cleat and other equipment  which his teammate emancipated from his locker with glee after his deadline to return to the team passed in november <BRK>steelers player went into le veon bell s locker  removing his nameplate and rummaging through item  bud dupree say thanks for the jordan brand cleat  pic twitter com gqaau hupd<BRK>but that missed year also recharged his battery for a run at free agency in    the question now are which team will line up to offer him a long term deal  and will that contract exceed the lightly guaranteed five year     million deal pittsburgh reportedly offered last offseason <BRK>the transition tag is the last real card pittsburgh could have played in it showdown with bell  it s the watered down light lager to the franchise tag s imperial stout  it allows other team to negotiate with a tagged player and even sign him to an offer sheet  <BRK>it would ve kept bell under steelers  control while the team work to hammer out a contract with him  though bell would also be free to talk shop with other interested team  the tag would mean pittsburgh could have the right to match any contract offered to the star tailback  but if it declined there s no compensation tied to his departure <BRK>here s how we described the process in our tag explainer earlier in the year <BRK>similar to the non exclusive tag  except the player get paid an average of the top   salary at his position  rather than top five  transition tagged player are free to negotiate with other team  but unlike non exclusive player  the original team get no compensation if it fails to match an offer <BRK>in short  the steelers could kinda sorta make bell a restricted free agent with the tag  though they don t stand to gain much in the process  if bell got the contract he s sought   the contract the steelers have been loathe to give him   then there would ve been little chance pittsburgh would match the deal  allowing him to leave the team without any compensation  <BRK>if no one offered bell a contract  he would ve wound up on the steelers  roster with a      million price tag  this would ve been extremely unlikely  <BRK>rather than burn off the last of it ammunition  pittsburgh is accepting defeat and regrouping  the franchise ha plenty of turmoil elsewhere to deal with anyway <BRK>antonio brown  bell s running mate for the first five year of his career  saw his frustration boil over into a week   benching and an eventual trade request  in the process  pittsburgh saw it afc north lead dissolve  only to wind up in the hand of the hated baltimore raven  the steelers currently have a shortage of goodwill running through their facility  and more contract drama with bell would have kept their meter low in   <BRK>instead  cutting bell loose allows the club to get it house in order and approach the offseason with a better idea of where it roster stand <BRK>bell is still a dynamic talent  but his hefty price tag limit his suitor  he want to be paid like a top running back and a no    wide receiver  putting his compensation somewhere north of   m annually  that would also  ostensibly  include greater guarantee than the typically stingy steelers had offered  for comparison s sake  only    million of antonio brown s     m extension wa guaranteed  <BRK>todd gurley s four year       million extension will be the benchmark in negotiation  though it s an imperfect comparison  brown s side will point to his proven track record of performance a a reaon to exceed those limit  negotiating team will point to his age    year old   dip in rushing efficiency in    his yard per carry dropped from     to       and the fact he sat all of   out in order to lower that number <BRK>still  his past production mean he s due for the megadeal he s chased  and he ll head to a team with a combination of need in the backfield and ample salary cap space  team like the jet  colt  or raider are a few candidate <BRK>bell s tenure in pittsburgh ended on one of the sourest note possible  but a clean break should benefit both side  the tailback is now set to finally earn the giant free agent contract he s sought since the   season ended  the steelers can move forward knowing james conner is now the engine that power their running game  <BRK>that s a win for bell  but now he s got to prove himself all over again to justify his two year feud in pittsburgh <BRK>
