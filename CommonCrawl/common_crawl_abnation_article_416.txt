texas and texas a m  it s a relationship that go way back  but after an ugly conference realignment breakup  the two just can t seem to get back on the same page  <BRK> here s a timeline of their trial and tribulation since splitting apart   <BRK> a month after texas a m president michael young said he support renewing the rivalry  <BRK> in multiple email obtained by the news through an open record request  young said the a m texas football game  is unlikely to happen   <BRK>   there are a variety of reason that this will be unlikely to happen  including separate conference schedule and scheduling many year out   <BRK> the heat scale  rating the flirtatious energy between texas and a m     now we re just being coy  <BRK> the state s governor  greg abbott  said in his state of the state address that the two team should play again  he d said this before   just scroll down   and repeated it here   <BRK>  i am inspired by the camaraderie and the collaboration that ha already infused this session  it seems unprecedented  and i ve got to tell you  i m feeling it myself   abbott said about   minute into his remark   i m feeling moved  and i want to set the example  for example  i m willing to step up and put aside past difference and work with  state rep   lyle larson to reinstate the rivalry game between the aggies and the longhorn   the announcement wa greeted with cheer  <BRK> the heat scale     because just like when he said it earlier  the governor isn t in charge here  just because an ex couple s parent badly want them to get back together doesn t mean the kid will go along with it   <BRK> a m president michael young and texas president greg fenves both tell the austin american statesman they support a rivalry renewal  but they don t offer any timetable  and they re really just leaning on their athletic director to figure something out   <BRK>  it s a storied rivalry of a hundred year or so   fenves said   we re supportive  of renewing it  young said   absolutely  we have been from day one   since a m joined the southeastern conference  added fenves   we ve told our ad  athletic director  to figure out a plan and bring it to u   <BRK> then came the caveat  <BRK>  there are some real practical and contractual issue with scheduling non conference game   fenves said   the sec is different from the big    we have non conference game scheduled   year out   <BRK> the heat scale     these are just two people saying they really should get together sometime   <BRK> texas  athletic director say the team will reunite eventually   <BRK> chris del conte on renewing ut a m football rivalry   at some point and time we will pick up our rivalry  it s important to our state and important to our fan base  i m assuming when it s appropriate and ready  we ll play   we d like to do that  it s just matching up schedule   <BRK> the heat scale     it s nice to tell your significant other you ll do something when you can  but this comment loses point for a lack of actual commitment   <BRK> there we have texas  qb responding to a new texas a m assistant s take slingin  by noting much of the sec s recent glory consists of riding alabama s coat tail  <BRK> the heat scale     standard jawin   but good to keep it at a steady simmer  <BRK> the governor want to get involved   <BRK> texa gov  greg abbott   my next goal a governor is to

greg byrne said   there were other force at work to make sure we didn t play   <BRK> the heat scale     that story ha a bunch of disheartening stuff on this rivalry and kansa missouri  but that particular quote is at least hot  <BRK>  me  personally  i think over the course of time that s going to happen   a m head coach kevin sumlin said when asked  while also talking about how well he know new horn coach tom herman   with our move to the sec  scheduling ha become a real issue   <BRK> the heat scale     sumlin s been predicting a reunion for year now  not that we don t appreciate him

didn t even hear any of the word in this second sentence  <BRK> the heat scale     do it texas and texas a m  it s a relationship that go way back  but after an ugly conference realignment breakup  the two just can t seem to get back on the same page  <BRK> a m athletic director scott woodward  via dailytrib com in texas  <BRK> will the aggies play the university of texas in football again

unchanged  laughing at your fallen rival is standard human behavior  <BRK> texas a m regent tony buzbee in a facebook post  via the austin american statesman  <BRK> i am going to advocate that the aggies play texa again in the near future  because of our brutal sec west schedule        the aggies need some cupcake game to rest and heal  in my view  texa is just a weak if not weaker than the non conference game we play  so we may a well play them  <BRK> heat scale     buzbee is  a he mention  only one regent  and regent aren t athletic director  but eating patries is often an enjoyable date
