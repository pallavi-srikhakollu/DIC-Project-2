nwell  one of the shoe ha dropped  manny machado will not be coming to philadelphia  <BRK>now  it s bryce or bust <BRK>it seems like month ago when manny machado wa accosted by some random union guy a he walked into his highly anticipated meeting with phillies official at citizen bank park  <BRK>hang on  it wa month ago  <BRK>at the time  machado wa the unquestioned apple of their eye  the phils  primary free agent target  and bryce harper wa the clear no     but today  the san diego padre jumped in front of the phillies and signed machado to a surprising   year     million deal  with an opt out after the fifth season <BRK>we don t know what the phillies  offer were to machado  but nbc sport  jim salisbury reported agent dan lozano gave the phils a chance to beat san diego s proposal  which they chose not to do  and general manager matt klentak s explanation wa both mystifying and infuriating <BRK> there s a certain value that we believe a player brings and we were willing to be aggressive   klentak said in a meeting with reporter later in the day   if the report are true  then this contract will exceed our valuation and sometimes you have to be willing to walk away <BRK>it s clear the phillies decided that paying machado    million wa a bridge too far  yes  the deal is the largest free agent contract ever given out in the history of american sport  and yes  over the lat couple month  it didn t appear a if machado and lozano were going to find a team to go that high  but at the start of the off seaon     million wa seen by most a the floor for machado and harper  so one wonder at what point the phils decided that number wa no good for them <BRK>it s also unclear if the phillies knew the exact contractual number of the san diego deal  so  there are four possibility here <BRK>i sure hope it s option no    <BRK>the phils got a chance to  stay in the game  and chose not to  which fly in the face of all their action and the reporting we had heard for month that machado wa their preferred player  but there s no doubt harper ha been the choice of most fan the whole time  and rumor had been growing that talk between the phillies and scott boras had been intensifying  what the machado contract doe to those negotiation is anyone s guess  certainly  machado s    million deal ha to make harper and boras feel good about their bargaining position <BRK>a for klentak s  exceeded their valuation  quote  it wa very poorly worded and ill advised  <BRK>the phillies have done excellent work this off season  the team ha improved on paper and matt klentak ha made good decision thus far  they are better defensively and at a number of key position  but sacrificed their top prospect  sixto sanchez  and two young player in j p  crawford and jorge alfaro  to do so  all of which make klentak s  exceeded our valuation  quote even more galling <BRK>everyone assumed when the phillies got involved with machado and harper  and after middleton said the team wa prepared to spend money and some of it  perhaps in a stupid way   the team wouldn t be afraid to go all in on mega money deal  to hear klentak use the phrase  exceeded our valuation  with regard to a   year old potential hall of fame player  a player that for a long time wa their no    target  feel like a complete   degree turn <BRK>the other possibility is our perception of their interest were wrong all along <BRK>regardless of the reason  it s clear phillie fan won t be happy with this off season unless they get bryce harper  and klentak talked about the perceived notion among the fanbase that it wa now  bryce or bust    quote via scott lauber  philly com  <BRK> we will continue to proceed with other free agent that make sense for this franchise  we have to remember that there will be other free agent after this offseason  there will be plenty of opportunity in the future to spend money and to make our team better  we cannot allow ourselves to be put in a position where we have to do something at all cost  there s a significant cost that we re willing to pay to add  but we have to be willing to walk away at some point  <BRK>but perhaps more telling wa when klentak wa asked if they would walk away from giving    million to harper  too   quote via matt breen  philly com   <BRK>  i won t comment on that   matt klentak said   i ll say this  every player is different  they bring different strength  weakness  risk  reward  etc  <BRK>so  some hope there <BRK>happily  it doesn t seem a if there is much competition for harper s service  the white sox wanted machado and reportedly thought they had the top offer for him  but gm ken williams said they  could not go  to that    million level for him  if they weren t willing to go    million for machado  would they go over that number for harper  it seems unlikely unless  like the phillies  they are higher on harper than machado  <BRK>the national made their initial   year     million deal at the end of the regular season  but after being rebuffed went on to sign patrick corbin  brian dozier  and a number of other free agent  jayson stark noted on a     fanatic interview with mike missanelli that washington would be way over the luxury tax for a long time if they did it <BRK> if they were now to add a    million a year player  that put them into the luxury tax purgatory unlike anything we ve ever seen  they d be in the    luxury tax bracket for eternity  <BRK>plus  nats player have been bad mouthing harper over the last few day  so a reunion seems unlikely on the surface there  too <BRK>the nightmare scenario is the dodger swooping in at the last minute  although that would go against everything team president andrew friedman ha ever done  it would appear that the phillies might be the only game in town  but what if there s a mystery team  can they afford to tell scott boras that his contract demand  exceed their valuation   <BRK>no  they cannot  <BRK>this all now lie on the shoulder of team owner john middleton  if harper isn t sold on philadelphia  a stark told missanelli on tuesday might be the cae  the phils need to make philly his no    choice with a truck full of cah  <BRK>there is no reason to wait for future free agent class  the nl east is going to be a dogfight and the phils need harper to keep up with the rest of the national league  they ve made move that indicate they re ready to win now  signing harper is a must  don t overthink this <BRK>most of the city ha gotten preemptively angry  and that s probably not fair to the phillies front office  at the end of the day  the phils will probably get their man  and if when that happens  there will be great rejoicing in the street  <BRK>if the phillies want harper  they need to make the   year     million offer  if he want    million  do it  obviously  there is a point where you walk away     million       million    but for harper  it s nowhere close to the line the phils drew for machado seemingly out of nowhere  and the reason you re feeling nervous about all this is that the phillies are now playing without a net  there is no fallback option  <BRK>so in the word of our beloved   phillies  we implore you  mr  middleton    with four simple word <BRK>it s harper or bust <BRK><BRK>
