bill c s annual preview series of every fbs team in college football continues  catch up here  <BRK> what a roller coaster these last few season have been in statesboro  <BRK> head coach  chad lunsford       second full year  <BRK>   record and s p  ranking        th  <BRK> projected   record and s p  ranking        st  <BRK> five key point  <BRK> five season at the fbs level have produced about two decade  worth of plot twist for georgia southern  a quick recap  <BRK> g finished   with one of the most rousing  emotional win of bowl season  beating emu in the last second in the camellia bowl  <BRK> a friend of mine recently got a chance to run a lower level english professional soccer team  <BRK> he said he came in with a business like plan and a ton of idea  but the impact of actual win and loss made the plan almost impossible to pull off  he said the club office a day after a loss were just so emotionally wrecked  and morale so quickly careened between great and terrible  that he found himself wanting to fix everything at once  abandon long term goal and make everybody happy that next saturday  <BRK> it s so easy to get knocked off course  and it s so hard to simply hug a program back into prominence  but lunsford somehow pulled it off  <BRK> just a quickly a the eagle had fallen apart  they had once again become one of the strongest program in the sun belt  <BRK> g return quarterback shai werts and most of it defense in    but lunsford s got some challenge to overcome  he ha to replace a lot of his skill corp  leading running back wesley field and monteo garrett  plus two of the three player to catch double digit pass  and two all conference offensive linemen  <BRK> plus  the schedule is unforgiving  the eagle play at lsu  projected fourth in s p   and minnesota   rd  in non conference play  and they hit the road to play appalachian state  troy  and arkansas state in the sun belt  that will make a conference title run awfully difficult  despite a solid no    preseason ranking  the eagle are projected to go only about      considering their short but dramatic fbs history  you figure they ll either go two or three win above or below that mark  but with lunsford and werts in place  i m guessing  above  is more likely than  below   <BRK>

   <BRK> god bless the georgia southern option  a i wrote in lat year s preview  identity is a blessing and a curse  and an option identity spell that out pretty clearly  on one hand    <BRK> at the same time    <BRK> committing to the option  then  is hard to fake  option life won t love you if you don t love it back  and from the moment summer wa hired  it didn t seem like he and the option were on the right term  <BRK>

   <BRK> the fence appear to be mended now  once he had become full time head coach  lunsford brought in former sam houston and new mexico offensive coordinator bob debesse  who had crafted a pretty unique approach to the option attack in albuquerque  <BRK> suffice it to say  the first year of the debesse werts relationship worked out pretty well  g ranked  nd in rushing marginal efficiency  with werts rushing for   non sack yard  throwing for    and producing a combined   touchdown with no interception and only three fumble  werts wa predictably sacked a lot when attempting to pas  southern s almost comical     percent sack rate on pasing down wa worst in fbs   but he hit a deep shot here and there  and g stayed on schedule reasonably well enough anyway  <BRK> field and garrett combined for     yard and   touchdown  but others thrived when given the opportunity  disparately sized sophomore to be logan wright          and matt laroche          combined for     yard per carry and a   percent success rate over     carry per game  and junior wesley kennedy iii gained a combined   yard over   carry and   pas target      yard per intended target  out of the slot  <BRK> in limited sample  the actual wide receiver did their  go deep  job pretty well  colby ransom  darion anderson  obe fortune  and mark michaud   all of whom return   combined to catch   of   pass for   yard and six touchdown  the security blanket  field  garrett  tight end elli richardson  are gone  but werts seems to still have a lot of weapon here  and i didn t mention recent three star recruit like sophomore running back grant walker  redshirt freshman andrew cunningham  or wonderfully named tight end jallah zeze jr  <BRK> really  the main question for this offense could come up front  a all conference center curtis rainey and left tackle jeremiah culbreth are both gone  but you can pretty eaily talk yourself into g being able to overcome that too    starting tackle drew wilson return after missing lat year with injury  and he s one of eight returnees with at leat a little bit of starting experience  they have   career start in all  <BRK> you don t like losing good running back or all conference linemen  but it really is pretty hard to worry about this attack  it s still got werts  it s still got debesse  it s still got experience up front  and it s still got fast skill guy  even if they re a bit younger this time around  <BRK> a daily ish mini column on the college football thing of the day  with some other stuff too  <BRK> the transition from summer  aggressive defense to the more pragmatic approach of new coordinator scot sloan went nearly a well a bringing debesse to town  <BRK> formerly appalachian state s co coordinator  sloan installed a system that cut the eagle  aggression play   g went from top   to top   in stuff rate  sack rate  and havoc rate   but also drastically reduced big mistake  the eagle went from allowing   gain of   plus yard in     th in fbs  to just   in     th   it probably isn t a surprise  then  that they also cut their point allowed by nearly   point per game  too  <BRK> better yet  sloan achieved this with a young front six seven  of the   linemen and linebacker to log at least   tackle  seven were freshman or sophomore  and eight return  the best pas rusher were junior to be raymond johnson and quan griffin  and the best run disruptors were probably johnson and another junior  linebacker rashad byrd  sloan doe have to replace end logan hunt and wlb tomarcio reese  but a majority of last year s production return  <BRK> any time you produce great big play number on defense  your safety probably played a big role  so to be sure  the loss of free safety joshua moon probably hurt  but sloan put a lot of responsibility on the shoulder of cornerback monquavion brinson and kindle vildor  and they responded  they not only played the ball well  combining for five interception and   pas breakup  they also tackled incredibly well and even made some play against the run  five combined run stuff   <BRK> brinson and vildor are both back for their respective senior seaon  a are  anchor  safety jay bowdry and lane ecton  combined  seven tackle for loss  two sack   <BRK> there are some exciting recent recruit at the cornerback position   sophomore justin birdsong  redshirt freshman brandon cross  and true freshman david spaulding were all mid three star prospect  but perhaps the most pivotal member of the secondary are either sophomore safety kenderick duncan or savannah state transfer donald rutledge jr  the loss of moon open up playing time for someone  <BRK> when werts raced for   yard on fourth and   to reach the emu   yard line in the closing second of the camellia bowl  the game wa effectively over  in fact  out of fairness  the eagle should have probably committed two or three procedure penalty just to back up and give emu a chance  tyler bass ended up hitting a   yard field goal at the buzzer to win the game  and a   yarder for bass wa like an extra point  <BRK> for the season  bass went   for   on pat    for   on field goal under   yard     and   for   on field goal over    that s absurd  and it ranked first in my fg efficiency rating  ahead of all three lou groza award finalist  it also powered a no    overall special team s p  ranking  wesley kennedy iii s return helped with that ranking a little bit  too  punter magill bauerle did not  everyone s back  but bass is the key figure here  <BRK> there aren t many hinge game on the georgia southern schedule this year  s p  project the eagle a at leat   point favorite in six game and at leat   point underdog in three  surprise result happen  obviously  but it s pretty eay to look at this schedule and quickly home in on the three game that will determine g  ceiling  <BRK> win all three  and you re on the doorstep of another   win season  and maybe a sun belt east title   lose all three  and you re eking out bowl eligibility  <BRK> despite a solid no    ranking  g is projected about      after what we saw from the eagle last year  that almost feel like a disappointment  but then you remember that they were     in    <BRK> the rebound that lunsford pulled off felt so natural that you could almost forget just how recently thing had completely fallen apart  he made smart coordinator hire and embraced southern s option identity in a way that his predecessor couldn t  and just like that  the eagle were right back in the sun belt s ruling class  i don t expect that to change any time soon
