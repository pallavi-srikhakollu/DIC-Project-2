the ncaa division i woman s baketball tournament begin friday  which mean that the wnba draft is right around the corner  while it s likely that wnba scout have seen enough of the bigger name in the senior clas  a well a draft eligible junior  to form opinion on them  not everyone s draft position is solidified  <BRK> player who want to pursue professional career will thus have this one last chance to make a good impression on potential employer  with that in mind  let s take a quick look at three wnba prospect that have the most to gain from a lengthy ncaa tournament run  <BRK> it s tough for mid major prospect to make the wnba  no matter how dominant a player is  if she s not playing in a  power five  conference  there will be question about how she d look against stronger competition   specifically  against fellow wnba prospect   <BRK> such is the plight for dillard  even after buffalo s improbable ncaa tournament run in    which included blowout win over higher seeded south florida and florida state   she entered the     seaon a an underdog  once again  dillard wa rarely listed a a player to watch or a surefire wnba draft pick jockeying for position on the big board  <BRK> dillard s response  forcing her way into the conversation by dominating the stat sheet  it s been an incredible seaon for buffalo s lead guard  per her hoop stats  dillard s     point per game ranked second in the nation  while she ranked in the  th percentile in both asist       and steal       per game  dillard also led the country in total free throw trip  imposing her will on defense just a she ha on draft board  <BRK> even after posting such gaudy number and winning mac tournament mvp honor  though  dillard still face an uphill battle when it come to her wnba draft stock  her final opportunity to appeal to wnba gm will be in the ncaa tournament  another buffalo upset or two might be more convincing than anything else to those at the professional level  <BRK> espnw s pick for national player of the year  gustafson ha been nothing short of brilliant all season long  the number she s put up have been monstrous      point  first among all division i player  and     rebound  along with a ridiculous     point per scoring attempt  gustafson s dominance on the low block wa on full display during the big ten tournament  when she dropped a cool   point on perennial favorite maryland en route to tourney mvp honor  <BRK> still  when it come to wnba mock draft  gustafson is typically listed below fellow center teaira mccowan  kalani brown and kristine anigwe  most pre tournament projection have her going late in the first round  from a physical perspective  it s not difficult to see why  she s not a big a mccowan and brown  nor a athletic a anigwe   <BRK> what gustafson doe have  however  is a soft touch at the rim  patience with the basketball  and an endless array of low post move that have frustrated big ten opponent for year  gustafson s balance  footwork and ability to finish with either hand make her arguably the most skilled center in the class  <BRK> what she ll have to do  then  is prove herself against the country s best  for all of gustafson s individual accolade  the one thing she s missing on her résumé is ncaa tournament success  a deep run in this year s tourney could be of great benefit to her draft stock  <BRK> it s been an up and down season for missouri in the sec  loss to florida  lsu and tennessee hurt them  but they also beat sec champ and ncaa runner up mississippi state  they ve been rewarded with a no    seed in the greensboro region  which feature plenty of intriguing potential matchup for the tiger  <BRK> missouri s one consistent factor throughout the seaon ha been cunningham  she finished conference play on a tear  and a a wnba prospect  there s plenty to like about her  cunningham is a   foot   perimeter player who can shoot the   pointer at a high level       percent this seaon and     percent the seaon prior  <BRK> still  there s something keeping cunningham from entering the discussion of top draft prospect  perhaps missouri s good but not great regular seaon ha played a part in that  or it could be that cunningham s physicality doesn t blow people away  if the latter is true  then cunningham ha likely been slotted a a late first  or early second round draft pick for some time now  <BRK> even so  should missouri advance to the later round in the greensboro region  cunningham could make a late push up the draft board  an upset of iowa  for instance  would be huge for the tiger  and their fiery leader could get a final reevaluation by potential wnba coach a a result  <BRK>
