a bill belichick like to say  you are what your record say you are   the boston celtic are currently     and fifth in the eatern conference  in the multitude of truth he dropped following the celtic loss to the orlando magic  kyrie irving said  i m not happy with being fifth  that s what i m focused on  <BRK>to go back to belichick  this is what boston is  right now  the season is far from over  the celtic just entered the second half of their regular season schedule  the first half didn t go the way anyone wanted or how anyone expected  the funny thing about expectation and prediction is that they are essentially useless once the ball is tipped on opening night <BRK>wa boston ever going to win   game  a prominent celtic fan bill simmons predicted  probably not  did you know that only   nba team have ever won a many a   game   the   wahington capitol won at a   win pace too  but there were only   game that seaon   the golden state warrior winning      and   game over a three year period make it seem like ripping off   win is eminently doable  when it s actually a historic feat <BRK>is boston going to win even   game  a still great  but far more reasonable accomplishment  probably not  they d have to go     over their final   game to get there  what about   game  that s a     close to the season  that s actually pretty reasonable  and essentially the pace the team is on <BRK>but this seaon isn t about regular seaon win anymore  a irving said  it s about position and seeding  the celtic need to be focused on climbing a high in the eat standing a possible  that mean winning game  so  of course  the overall win total will climb  but it s more about taking advantage of the remaining game against philadelphia  indiana  milwaukee and toronto  who are  in order  the team boston need to leapfrog in the standing <BRK>of their   remaining game  the celtic have seven game left against the five team they are chasing <BRK>         philadelphia     game  both away <BRK>         indiana     game    home    away <BRK>         milwaukee     game  away <BRK>         toronto     game    home    away <BRK>sure  boston trail philadelphia by two game and indiana by three  but there is a reason fivethirtyeight still project the celtic to finish third in the eastern conference with a record of      the reason  boston is already pretty good  despite being disappointing  and they should only get better  but how do they get better  that s the question everyone is asking  unfortunately  there is no one answer  there are a lot of answer  let s try and get to some of them here <BRK>the rotation<BRK>when the celtic roster is fully healthy  which it should be in a week or so when aron baynes return  brad stevens enters each game with   legitimate nba player  the only guy who are currently fringe player are end of bench option brad wanamaker  guerschon yabusele and the two two way player  p j  dozier and r j  hunter  everyone else  excluding jabari bird for obvious reason  ha shown enough to be considered an nba player <BRK>unfortunately    rotation guy are way too many  even if you take robert williams  because he s a rookie  and semi ojeleye  the least talented ready of the    out of the mix  that leaf   guy  that sort of depth is awesome to get through a long nba regular season  but once you hit the playoff  you want to know your     guy  those are the one stevens is giving between   and   minute to in the postseason <BRK>over halfway through the season  stevens doesn t know those     guy  he know some of them  irving  jayson tatum  al horford  marcus smart and marcus morris are all lock  that s the current starting five and all will feature prominently come the postseason  the other     guy  the hope is that it would be jaylen brown  terry rozier  gordon hayward and aron baynes  that leaf daniel theis out of the mix  but available when necessary <BRK>and therein lie the rub  that s the hope  but none of it is certain    game in  we should know by now  let s asume baynes is there  he han t been a good offensively a lat year  but he s still the best center boston ha when they need bulk and strength  he s a comfortable rotation lock when healthy <BRK>what about brown  rozier and hayward  each bring their own set of challenge  let s start with the eay one in hayward  he s still not    back  he s really close  hayward is back to just playing baketball now  you can tell he s not thinking worrying a he drive to the hoop or jump in traffic for rebound  but hayward s timing is still off  if you ve ever gone a year without playing baketball  you know you re a mess for a long time when you try to play again  that s where hayward is  he may not be right all seaon  paul george said it wa a full year of being back before he felt back to normal  because of their investment in hayward  the celtic have no choice but to play through it  otherwise  he might never get back and then that s a    million albatross on the cap sheet <BRK>a for brown and rozier  nothing should be given that isn t earned  brown lost his starting job and a large chunk of his minute because  quite frankly  he wa playing terribly  the transition to being the clear fifth option wa hard on brown  he struggled with it and that carried over to his initial game off the bench  brown went out with an injury and came back a different guy  he seems to be figuring it out  his energy ha been great  but he s also been under control  brown probably doesn t get back a starting spot this year  but that s ok  boston need his energy off the bench to give the team a lift when they need one <BRK>rozier is a different story  there is no other way to put this  his season ha been a mess  he s had a few nice game here and there  particularly when he start in place of irving  but they are few and fleeting  rozier is under   percent from the floor and under   percent from behind the arc  for reference  both of those number are worse than noted bad shooter smart  for a score first player  that type of shooting is simply unacceptable <BRK>rozier made many think he wa a starting level point guard with his play in last year s playoff  in reality  most overlooked the role he wa really playing  sure  rozier brought the ball up the floor  but most of the offense ran through horford  rozier s increased assist were a product of him having the highest usage rate of his career  not really his overall quality of play <BRK>the harsh reality is that rozier isn t really a point guard on offense  he can be one defensively for sure  because he ha the ability to be a top notch defender on that end of the floor  but offensively  he s a small scoring guard  we ve seen those guy have incredible value in the nba  but generally a reserve  but  those shooting percentage have to get up there  otherwise  rozier is a lesser version of jordan clarkson <BRK>so where doe this leave the rotation  stevens probably need to have some really tough conversation with some guy  last year wa last year  it wa awesome  but it doen t matter to where this team is going  if brown and rozier aren t playing well  they should sit  in year past  guy like phil pressey and shane larkin earned extra minute simply because they played really hard and made the most of their minute  it might be time for ojeleye and wanamaker to get a chance on those night when brown and rozier aren t bringing it <BRK>and the bigs beyond horford and baynes  theis  williams and yabusele  have to understand that there just aren t minute for all of them  two  if not all three  are going to have to sit most night  it s just the reality of the situation  team are trending smaller and smaller  especially in the playoff  boston ha to follow suit <BRK>a it stand  stevens ha six player he can trust  the five starter and baynes  that s not what anyone expected at the halfway point of the seaon  he s got to find a few more guy who fit best  and before we start  timelord need to play   pleae note his struggle defensively  we all love williams  potential  but he s just not ready to contribute to a team that hope to contend for the final  he wa a mess against orlando  the celtic can t afford to let him learn on the fly  they have too much ground to make up for that <BRK>the roster<BRK>stevens can only play the guy he ha  a much a i m sure he d love to go to anthony davis  he s not a celtic and won t be anytime soon  if ever  some have suggested that stevens doe his best work when he ha a limited roster  but one that is full of  try hard  guy  and there may be something to that  but  he doen t asemble the roster <BRK>however  danny ainge doe  and he may be the guy who ha to make a change here  ainge said a trade is unlikely  and that remains true  but he ha to at least look  fan love trade  and ainge obviously doe too  so you can be sure he s gauging interest in something that move thing forward <BRK>the  trade rozier for something awesome  ship ha sailed and is long gone over the horizon  he may get a big offer a a restricted free agent this summer that boston can t match  but that s because a handful of team need point guard and nba team with cap space continually do really stupid thing  at any rate  it look like rozier s time in boston ha a clock that is ticking down  it might be best for ainge to trade him  even if it look like the celtic don t return a much value  one  they re likely to lose rozier for nothing this summer anyway <BRK>two  this isn t about talent anymore  boston ha enough of that  this is about fit  it s about someone who is happy to take the     minute per game that are available behind irving and play a role  rozier seems unwilling  or unable  to adapt to that  and that s not really on him necessarily  he wa a starter on a team that got within a game of the final  he s looking for the first big contract of his career  it s all well and good to say  he should sacrifice for the greater good   but he s got to look out for his career too  nba team  boston especially  are ruthless about moving on from player  it s unfair to call ainge heartless  because he s not  but he s going to do what he think is best for the celtic  if he let emotion guide him  isaiah thomas would still be in green <BRK>to date  ainge ha shown rozier a lot of love  he regular talk about rozier s potential and how much he s enjoyed his growth  but it s probably time for ainge to let rozier take the next step somewhere else <BRK>in addition  and this is not ainge s or anyone with boston s fault  but jabari bird is holding a valuable roster spot  there is an upcoming court date that may shed some light on his situation and immediate future in baketball  but the reality is that this is likely to take a while longer to play out  the celtic are letting the nba handle it now  and the league is being very careful here  setting a precedent now could make thing far messier for the nba down the line  adam silver is concerned about the league a a whole  and making sure everything is done for the best interest of all his constituent  not just boston <BRK>but for the celtic  there ha been increaing chatter about adding experience to the roster  someone who ha been in those playoff battle and know what it take  it doesn t even need to necessarily be a contributor on the floor  a boston already ha too many of those guy  but they could use a voice in the locker room  almost every other contender ha a roster spot  or a way to eaily open one  right now  ainge can t add that guy  he doesn t have the roster spot  that make it imperative that the celtic press the nba for a decision or guidance on bird  sooner rather than later <BRK>the expectation and goal<BRK>we started this article talking about how you have to throw out the preseaon expectation  just like lat year  when hayward went down five minute into the seaon and then irving s seaon ended in march  you have to adjust  no one should still be holding on to thought of   plus win  those time are gone  it s about positioning for the playoff a irving said <BRK>it s on ainge and stevens to do some level of resetting here  the goal remains the same  get to the nba final  that s all that really matter  if they win  only    game along the way  whatever  it s about being ready for the playoff and playing your best ball when they roll around <BRK>that might mean some tough conversation about the rotation  it might mean some trade to balance the roster  that all come with some hurt feeling  you may even lose a guy or two along the way  but sometimes le is more  everyone want to pile up talent in the nba  but we re constantly reminded that fit matter more than anything else  the warrior have more frontline talent than anyone  but all of their piece also fit incredibly well  that get overlooked because of the name  but the game are greater than the name <BRK>right now  the celtic are le than the sum of their part  and that s probably what hurt most  for year  stevens had boston playing a more than the sum of their part  they made the conference final in back to back year  the first year wa one of those  how did this happen   run  that featured one of the most fun to root for celtic team in year  lat year s team wa right up there in fun factor  because it wa so unexpected <BRK>this seaon  the conference final weren t a hope  they were an expectation  and that s fine  it s good to have expectation and to hold people accountable  but you have to adjust a you go  and that includes everyone  player  coach  executive and fan  this isn t a   win team  who care anymore  this can still be a final team  that expectation han t changed and it shouldn t change  it s all still there for the celtic  they just need to figure out how to get there from here <BRK>
