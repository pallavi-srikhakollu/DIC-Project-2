the nhl trade deadline is five day from today  and my bold prediction is that the leaf will do nothing exciting   <BRK> the leaf have made one nhl trade so far  and they netted jake muzzin for this year s first round pick and two prospect of note  the leaf don t feel like the sort of team that spends the first rounder and then worry about how it will look that they don t have one  i m not sure kyle dubas worry about how anything look to outsider  so i don t think they ll make any effort to replace that pick  <BRK>  <BRK> duba is on record a being opposed to rental this seaon  and i m on board with that   which i asume he doesn t care about   but i ll take it a step farther and say i m almost always opposed to rental unless a team ha a really gaping hole in an otherwise high quality lineup  what you re doing with a gaping hole at the end of february is a question for the gm unless you just lost someone to injury  no matter the reaon  buying a rental violates rule one of aset value management  don t buy high   <BRK> fan often want their team to make a splah  but team need to balance their short term and long term goal in way that differ dramatically from fan thinking  most fan would take a cup now over better chance to win five cup over the next ten year  duba ha to figure out for himself where he weight win now v alway keep winning  but if he want to go down in history a a great gm  he ha to alway have an eye on the future   <BRK> one of the goal of any elite player is to outdo the star of the past  auston matthew want to be atop a lot of list when he retires  so why should kyle dubas be any different  hockey man that he is  he want to not just better every leaf gm since he wa born  hell  since i wa born   he want to better the best gm of all time  the goal is creating a dynasty that doesn t dissolve into chaos at the end   <BRK> with the bonus situation this year  the leaf have to be wary of adding too much salary now  the total possible bonus aren t all that possible  so the real amount that might need to get paid out in total  some already ha been  is      million  give or take a few part of million  the projected cap space for the end of the season is over    million  but bear in mind that contract added late cost a prorated amount  so you can add more than a million at the deadline and keep that space free for the bonus  there are other method to maximize the space between now and the end of the regular season  too  thing the leaf haven t bothered to do  like deciding to risk justin holl on waiver and empty out the press box a little  the leaf have room this year  just not a lot of room  <BRK>  <BRK> with the cap situation next season  the leaf have to very cautious about how much salary they add next year  next season is the really tight season for the salary cap  it s not like it s a breeze in subsequent year  but it get easier  the maximum salary the leaf can pay their fourth liner  depth defencemen and press box extra is barely over the minimum  there will be no    million committed to a  c for any sort of term because it just can t be made to fit  if they re going to add a player now with term into next year  that player ha to be either cheaper than the current depth option or good enough to take a job higher in the lineup  <BRK> the idea of a retained salary transaction is attractive when searching for a better mid range player  but you have to pay for that over and above what you re paying for the player  the name that leap to mind is vlad namestnikov  who the ranger overpaid judging by how they ended up using him  he s paid    million this season and next  and he is exactly the sort of versatile forward the leaf are reportedly searching for at a quality that s worth paying for  the issue will be can they afford to pay the extra asset to get the ranger to retain    of his salary and therefore cut his cap hit to    million  charlie coyle is the only other similar player likely to be moved  and his cap hit is      million this year and next  but the wild are much le likely to be willing to retain  for me  the choice is one of these two on a retained deal or nothing  and the cost in pick and prospect would likely make me say no anyway   <BRK>  <BRK> the leaf are getting weaker in prospect depth and do not have any extra pick of value   the loss of two player with decent chance to have some kind of nhl career in carl grundstrom and sean durzi ha thinned out the rank of potential future leaf  the first round pick this summer is gone  so there s no chance now for another rasmus sandin   likely the leaf  highest quality prospect at the moment  timothy liljegren is right with him  either equal to or a little behind sandin  but after those two are accounted for  the drop off is noticeable and steep  this is a concern when planning for the keep winning future  but it also limit the amount of trading the leaf can do    <BRK>  <BRK> bob mckenzie ha expressed the idea that the leaf will only do  dollar out dollar in  trade   given the cap situation and the asset pool  i think this is plausible  to get namestnikov or coyle  the leaf would need to convince the trading team to take back a contract of a similar amount  it would be almost impossible to get the cap strapped wild to do that unless he wa an impact forward  and like most team these day  the ranger want a quick turnaround rebuild  everyone is now competing with the leaf record here  and they don t want some long term deal like nikita zaitsev s  <BRK>  <BRK> the fantasy trade for nikita zaitsev violate rule one of asset value management  don t sell low  aside from finding a team that would take on a long term contract in a trade  the idea that you run a hockey team by constantly moving out the player who is playing the poorest mean you re always selling low  given zaitsev s playoff performance last year  which no one likely remembers  but wa very good  i d hang on to him through this playoff and see if he pull the same trick  if he doe  then i d think long and hard about the cost of moving him out and the availability of replacement at a time when his value is up not down  <BRK> the leaf have made one ahl trade so far  and it addressed the defence forward imbalance in the ahl   that imbalance got worse recently because of injury and the canuck trade of sam gagner  if the call ups from the echl are not enough  the marlies bos  laurence gillman may decide to do some dealing to shore up the ahl  which will not be very thrilling  but might maximize the chance of the marlies actually giving sandin and liljegren some more playoff experience   <BRK> the chl regular season end in one month  and the marlies may choose to go with undrafted junior graduate on atos to shore up the roster  unfortunately the soo greyhound are in the playoff  so those player won t be available for a lot longer  but surely there are player on other team who might be worth trying out on the marlies   <BRK> there s a chance the leaf might find an ahl centre in a trade  and it s not impossible they make a more interesting move than that  it will be tough to accomplish while keeping the total expenditure in asset and cap space worth the improvement to the team  i m forecasting boredom next monday  but dubas is competing with every great gm in hockey history  so maybe he s got a four goal game in him for his first trade deadline   <BRK> i think he already did that on free agent day  though  <BRK>  <BRK> this poll is closed  <BRK>  <BRK>
