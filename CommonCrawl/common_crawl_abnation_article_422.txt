last year  my bracket pick performed better than in the recent  i pegged three of the final four correctly and went     in my post first four selection  good for a winning percentage of      unfortunately  i went   for   once the focus of the college basketball world switched to san antonio  thanks to my ill advised selection of an arizona wildcat kansa jayhawks title game  with a wildcat  victory  oops   <BRK> hopefully  my bracket won t be completely busted before the final weekend in    but before i quickly make my pick  i want to share some thought on filling out your bracket that build off my monday analysis of the selection committee s new tool  the net  and it final seed list      <BRK> for many fan  including myself  the first two day of the ncaa tournament are superior to all of the others  thanks both to the constant action and the maximum potential for drama  so  i examined each of the eight matchup grouping to determine what might be the most intriguing option for upset  based on the net rating of the opponent  <BRK> if you want to win your bracket pool  sweet sixteen and elite eight success is paramount  and with most of your upset pick likely to be swept aside by the time second round sunday end  you need to know which of the higher seed could face a trickier path to picking up the two second weekend victory needed to make it to minneapolis  for these two round  i compared the placement of the top four seed in each region on both the committee s seed list and in the selection sunday net table  <BRK> yesterday  i wrote that the eat wa the weakest region by far  a the total and average of it participant  net ranking were far higher than the others  however  much of that wa driven by seed five through    looking at only the total net ranking of the region s top four seed  the eat  duke  michigan state  lsu and virginia tech  end up a the strongest  edging the midwest and west  so  you might expect the no    overall seed  the blue devil to have the most difficult path to the final four   <BRK> on the other hand  the south  the strongest region overall  ha the weakest top four seed total     compared to the eat s   and midwest west s     no doubt driven by the presence of kansa state  they re  th in the net  which is the lowest ranking of any of the bracket s top   team   four spot below kansa  so maybe virginia s road to minneapolis won t be quite a difficult a anticipated  <BRK> totaling the top four team in each region a they appear in the selection committee s official seed list provides a different perspective   in this cae  north carolina s midwest rate a the most difficult  with gonzaga s west being slightly eaier than either duke s eat or virginia s south   <BRK> now it s time to actually share my selection  i ll limit my commentary from this point forward  since much of my analysis ha led to these decision  for better or worse  remember that if you use my pick  you do so at your own risk  we ll go with the left side of the bracket first  east and west   then the right  south and midwest   with the final four at the end  this bracket seems top heavy  but there s room for chaos  particularly away from the top two seed line  <BRK> first four winner  nc central to set up the crosstown matchup with duke and temple over belmont  since i always pick any team i didn t project into the bracket to win at least one  <BRK> first round winner     duke     ucf     mississippi state     virginia tech     temple     yale     louisville     michigan state <BRK> off to d c      duke     virginia tech     temple     michigan state <BRK> regional final     duke over    michigan state <BRK> first four winner  prairie view a m and arizona state <BRK> first round winner     gonzaga     syracuse     murray state     florida state     buffalo     texas tech     florida     michigan <BRK> traveling to anaheim     gonzaga     florida state     buffalo     michigan <BRK> regional final     gonzaga over    buffalo <BRK> first round winner     virginia     oklahoma     oregon     uc irvine     saint mary s     purdue     cincinnati     tennessee <BRK> bound for louisville     virginia     oregon     saint mary s     tennessee <BRK> regional final     tennessee over    virginia <BRK> first round winner     north carolina     utah state     auburn     northeastern     iowa state     houston     seton hall     kentucky <BRK> going to kansa city     north carolina     auburn     iowa state     kentucky <BRK> regional final     north carolina over    kentucky <BRK> national semifinal  east    duke over west    gonzaga in a maui rematch and midwest no    unc over south no    tennessee <BRK> national final  duke top unc in their unprecedented fourth meeting of the season       <BRK>
