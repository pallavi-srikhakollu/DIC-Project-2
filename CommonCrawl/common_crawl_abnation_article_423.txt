the player championship s return to march finished with a hall of fame winner and a frenzied final round  it s not a major  but it is an event that stand alone at one of the best and most instantly recognizable venue  rory mcilroy ha been the best player in the world in   and his win at the biggest event of the year to date validates that  here are five thought from the weekend at tpc sawgrass <BRK>the first attribute we cite with rory s game is his driving  and with good reaon  he is the best driver of the golf ball in the world  he lead the tour in stroke gained off the tee and hit it mind boggling distance  his game is obviously about so much more than power  but if you have to pick one trait that is cited first a a signifier of his premier spot in golf  that s it <BRK>when he s cooking  however  it s the approach shot that are always the most fun to follow  the drive are reliably there  but when he s dialed  the approach shot are what generates the anticipation and tension  this not necessarily unique to rory  but it s been the case throughout his career  it wa the case when he won the u s  open on a soft congressional  it wa when he won his pga championship  it definitely wa the case when he won the british open  where he hit two approach shot into par  s during what is arguably the greatest hour or two of golf in his career  <BRK>the driver doe so much work for rory and put him in all these great spot with massive advantage  but the approach shot are the moment when you edge onto your seat with the ball in the air  the moment that feel so determinative  and the moment when you most often see rory in full flight <BRK>the one example of i ll pluck from his player championship win  and one that will stay with me the longest  is his second shot into the  th hole on friday  this felt like the stretch when rory put the pedal down to ensure he d be a contender near the top of the leaderboard all weekend  it wa a perfect   iron distance and rory hit the perfect   iron  with the stimulating shot tracer there to pick it all up a it sailed over the water and drew back to the front of the green  these are the few second of payoff that make golf worth watching <BRK>eagle for  mcilroyrory he s   back of the lead    liveunderpar pic twitter com tnjv amq <BRK>the next day  a crazy attempt at this green resulted in his ball bouncing into the water  on sunday  a   iron from the rough resulted in the clinching birdie  what he called his best shot of his entire year so far wa an approach shot  a pure   iron from a fairway bunker that put him back in the lead on sunday  the driver will always be there  and it s the club that make it all possible  but when he s on  rory is the most fun player to watch in golf  and the second shot are where we so often see why  <BRK>the coverage of golf excels at overblowing personal growth narrative that probably have le to do with the outcome or success and failure of an individual player  sergio garcia  found peace  and wa centered  until he didn t and hauled off on a bunch of green  rory ha final round demon  until he doesn t because his wedge or putter or whatever club come through for four round  not just sunday  so much time and energy is put into discussing unprovable and intangible ephemera that s not counted on the scorecard <BRK>rory is beloved by the medium and fan because he doe so often brilliantly articulate how he s feeling or who he is beyond the golf shot  he sound like a real human being  a smart one  and not some golfing automaton  this sunday  he dropped a line about how much had changed in his time at the player  from his first time missing the cut   year ago and then getting thrown out of nearby bar in jax beach for being underage  it s not much  but he s relatable at least for a second <BRK>the larger narrative around rory at the moment is how he s not letting golf define who he is a a person  it s not medium created  but from rory s own word over the lat year and throughout this successful start to    he preached it again on sunday night  telling golf channel he d shoot   and be happy for the day or a   and be sad for the rest of the day in whatever else he wa doing with his life  now  he tell u he s separated the two   the golf life and who he is a a person away from his success and failure on the golf course <BRK>it s catnip for the narrative loving medium  rory ha undoubtedly gone through a stretch of real self reflection over the past year or so  he is one of the few player you can reliably assume ha put actual thought into talking about who he is and how he s feeling and is not just spewing it out there to fill uncomfortable time talking about something more than his golf shot  how much weight we assign it for explaining those good golf shot is a separate matter <BRK>on the matter of the unprovable and unknowable intangible stuff  the idea of tiger wood a  just another guy  on the pga tour is a facinating concept to monitor this year  he s played four event  made four cut  looked  fine  throughout  and never sniffed actual  real contention on the weekend  tiger is obviously the biggest draw in the history of the game and it s impossible for him to quietly do anything and be  just another guy  in the field  this is more about where he slot on leaderboards and not all the hype and scrutiny from the outside  <BRK>it feel odd to say for a   time major winner that played the greatest golf ever seen  but the   season wa a comeback where each start  whether it wa the valspar championship or the master  wa an accomplishment  by the end of the year  when he d made a handful of start and stayed healthy  a win  any win  whether it wa a major championship or a random limited field party in a far flung corner of the globe  would be a triumph <BRK>now we re in year two after we ve seen him make a full season of start  win  and stay healthy  what s he chasing now at these non major and how do continued early tee time on the weekend affect him  how much can he gain  both personally and from those measuring and scrutinizing on the outside  from playing bay hill or another wgc or even the player  that s not discounting those event or what he personally get out of them  i m legit curious  <BRK>the rep matter a he get ready for the four event that can still seriously alter the final view we take of his career  doe another win or top five at bay hill or the wgc match play do that  he will say it is all part of a  process a he ready for the major  but playing each weekend completely out of contention cannot be fun for the most maniacally competitive golfer in the game s history  <BRK>tiger is older and his body is patched together and he s never going to approach his peak golf  maybe just making the start and staying healthy is still the accomplishment in year two of the comeback  he can still obviously be great and probably will be this year  it may just come in shorter burst  he may be more consistently a top     player on the leaderboard instead of somewhere in the top    how doe he handle sustained run of playing out the string weekend at event that can have minimal impact on the larger view of his career  <BRK>sunday at the player brought manic leaderboard movement and a flurry of absurd highlight shot in the final three hour  the most compelling play  however  wa not a good shot but rather a horrible one that followed an intense caddie player conversation  <BRK>jon rahm s rapid ascent to the very top of the world ranking ha come with fantastic golf  entertaining eruption and tantrum  and some puzzling on tilt decision  sunday s round included his worst mistake yet  one that golf channel s postgame show compared to jean van de velde  rahm attempted a   in       shot at a critical time on the back nine while in the lead and playing from the final group  <BRK>rahm tried to play an   iron from the sand  that needed to draw some   yard against a hurting wind  and carry   yard around tree  over water and another bunker  his caddie wa  uh  strongly against it  <BRK>aside from the shot  this wa an example of the rapid improvement in production of these event and another argument for mic ing up the player  it may be uncomfortable at time  but the entertainment product is better  <BRK>there will be overreaction to this obstinate rahm moment  is this a sign of  needing to mature    will he ever get it   <BRK>it wa just a horrible decision  but also one that make rahm far more interesting to watch than some other young superstar  the golf shot are great  but the volcanic activity  caution free approach  and high wire tension make him stand out  he doesn t need to change to win  he may just win le than he should <BRK>a fun game to play all weekend wa listening to how the broadcat and tour rep would characterize the player a something of great importance that is not officially a major championship  i heard these people call it a  mega event   one of the biggest event  the first championship of championship seaon  the ultimate paradox  the purest test  an unparalleled test  the gold standard  and the biggest event of the year     so far     in golf  <BRK>i m sure i am missing many other example but the arbitrary category we ve assigned to event  including major  put the player in a position that can have the hypemen and broadcaster tied up in knot  it is an amusing game of framing and branding to listen for during the championship <BRK>
