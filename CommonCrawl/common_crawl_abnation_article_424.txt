football helmet are now considered a look  <BRK>  game on  public television    <BRK> a post shared by  dc    chicagodonc  on jan      at    am pst <BRK> yep  that is a los angeles charger and texas longhorn helmet  those aren t the only team that have been featured in paris   clemson and iowa have been  too   <BRK>  off white fall winter   men s collection   featuring playboi carti and offset

ok  so all of these look are by a designer named virgil abloh  whose line is called off white  he s also the artistic director of louis vuitton  while it s unclear why exactly these football helmet are featured in certain look  abloh did attend wisconsin  where he graduated in    here s abloh wearing a wisconsin t shirt during a   event   <BRK> abloh got his degree from uw in engineering in    and creatively applied what he learned to an entirely different occupation  <BRK> at the uw  abloh studied civil engineering at the advice of his father  though he wa  sort of irreverent  toward the major  he doesn t regret it   everything i did  in some way  made this result happen   abloh explains  in studying engineering  he learned how to multitask and problem solve   the basis of his career   i have a philosophy on problem solving  i guess   he say  <BRK> a pause  i ask what that philosophy is  <BRK>  there s   remnant of juxtaposition   abloh posit  he expatiates on the idea that functionality and modern humor are part of his approach to design  and that each solution should serve a purpose   sort of vague answer   he concludes   but that s  like  a vague question   <BRK> abloh s vague response to question about his achievement may be a wisconsin thing  he sound a little like badger football head coach paul chryst trying to explain what make his program so consistent   <BRK> from my colleague louis bien s profile of wisconsin s   team   <BRK>  right   he say   but i think i do agree that there is a formula or a blueprint   or whatever  that s even too fancy   but there s a way to do it that i think is right and kind of time tested for this place  you always want to try to improve that  but you don t want to drastically change    <BRK>        <BRK>  and we talk about this all the time  the best part of football is playing the game  and you only win the game at the end of the game   chryst say   so if all you re concerned about is winning the game  you missed the best part of the game  and that s playing   <BRK> just last summer  abloh shared a hug with yeezy after his louis vuitton line debuted   <BRK>   virgilabloh    kaynewest  emotional   louisvuitton show <BRK> a post shared by  takashi murakami   takashipom  on jun      at    am pdt <BRK> west helped abloh get into the fashion industry  and the two actually go way back   <BRK> his entry into fahion happened in a roundabout way  abloh  who studied civil engineering and architecture  got his foothold in the industry a west s creative director  though he s always been reticent about the job so his exact contribution have been hard to define   after the two struck up a partnership in the early  s  when he  west  and their crew went to the paris show in    abloh felt distinctly like an outsider   we got into about   percent of the show   he recalled to w magazine   we were a generation that wa interested in fahion and weren t supposed to be there   <BRK> but he and west had already made name for themselves through music  and being young and eager to learn  were able to get internship at fendi   we ain t get to do nothing   west said of the experience in an interview earlier this year   we were just happy to have a key card   <BRK> we ve reached out to off white regarding why football helmet were included in certain look  and are eagerly awaiting a reply   <BRK>    fellow wisconsin alumnus melvin gordon play for the charger  so perhaps gordon hooked him up there   <BRK>    abloh did release a line with nike last summer  so maybe he s just a football fan who who want to include the sport with his work   <BRK>    texas is back folk  and everyone know it   that includes paris fashion week attendee   <BRK>    clemson just won the national championship  so being invited to the white house for fast food and getting your helmet shown at paris fashion week is fitting   <BRK> stay tuned a we further investigate football helmet at paris fahion week  <BRK>
