the no    seed kentucky wildcat barely escaped the no    seed wofford terrier     in the second round of the ncaa tournament <BRK>the start of this game couldn t have been any worse  wofford couldn t miss and kentucky couldn t hit water if they fell out of a boat  but the cat withstood it  the terrier were hitting everything from deep in the first half  but uk limited their opportunity inside the arc  thus  kentucky went into the half with a narrow     lead <BRK>ashton hagans wa extremely aggressive in this one  he missed a lot of easy bucket  but he wan t afraid to take the ball to the rim  getting to the free throw line wa his signature move today <BRK>jemarl baker provided a huge  huge spark off the bench  without him  kentucky would have fallen flat on it face today  he hit multiple big shot and his defense wa lockdown <BRK>
