antonio brown isn t going to be with the steelers next season  after an odd end to his   season  and an instagram post with team owner art rooney ii  the two agreed it wa  time to move on   though it s not a given  after general manager kevin colbert said the team would need significant compensation  <BRK> now  one of the best wide receiver in the nfl is looking for a new home  of course  all   other team should want brown  though many simply aren t realistic  but this post isn t to determine which one are most realistic  because honetly  it s not nearly a fun a cooking up pipe dream scenario  <BRK> you know that scene in the office where michael scott is in a ton of debt  and creed tell him to declare bankruptcy  michael then proceeds to just yell that he declares bankruptcy  and deems everything is good  <BRK> that s basically what we re doing here  i don t know how antonio brown would just magically pop up on any of these roster  but damn it  we re doing it anyway  <BRK> putting brown with pat mahomes instantly make them the best quarterback wide receiver duo in the nfl  you can make a good case for brown being the game s best receiver for the past five year  and throwing him in kansa city s offense would be must watch tv  <BRK> when mahomes is doing thing like no look pass  <BRK> go ahead and put mahomes in the hall of fame right now  pic twitter com  jwqatkft  <BRK> and brown can clutch up like he did on sunday night football against the packer in    <BRK> the two could make a mean football mixtape  and there s just simply not enough generational talent in the nfl to be able to accomplish this  but brown and mahomes could  <BRK> mahomes had     yard    touchdown  and   pick in his first year a a starter  and he wa the nfl s mvp  it s already scary enough that he s probably going to get better and put up number we never thought possible  adding brown to that equation  whewwww  <BRK> that s an offense you re not going to stop   which is going to be kind of the point for all of these  <BRK> the falcon fan in me threw up a little in my mouth typing that  <BRK> assuming brees doesn t have that severe drop off because he s   year old  see  brett favre and peyton manning   good luck stopping an offense where it s brown  michael thomas on the other side  and alvin kamara  <BRK> brees is a quarterback who ha made good player seem great  brown s proven himself to be one of the game s best with ben roethlisberger slinging him the pill  so imagine if you make brees his quarterback with those other option around him  <BRK> he s also already got choppa style down too  so he d fit right in  <BRK> the only thing stopping this offense is sean payton insisting that taysom hill get the football inside the five yard line after an impressive and extensive drive  <BRK> well what about nickell robey coleman and bad referee  you ask  <BRK> with all due respect to tommylee lewis  brown get that defensive pas interference call  <BRK> i don t want this to come off a some supreme matt ryan slander  because he s been an nfl mvp  but not even he  or former falcon offensive coordinator steve sarkisian  could mess up a wide receiving corp of brown  julio jones  and calvin ridley  ok  sark might lol   <BRK> much like if brown were on the saint  this falcon offense would probably be so good that not even   s injury plagued  can t stop a nosebleed defense wouldn t matter  a healthy devonta freeman in the backfield and austin hooper a a decoy at tight end  and there s no way the falcon don t put up at leat   point a game  <BRK> we ll just pretend like this never happened  <BRK> julio jones say falcon don t want antonio brown   we good over here  http   t co bbavflzne  <BRK> moving right along     <BRK> this might be the least sexy of all of the previously mentioned mega offense  but it is still a pretty idea  the ram were still a joy to watch last year despite that dud of a     super bowl loss against the patriot  and would be even more fun with brown  <BRK> along with one of the nfl s best running back in todd gurley  jared goff would be able to work with brown  brandin cook  cooper kupp  and the troy aikman proclaimed best wide receiver in football robert wood  <BRK> also  i think brown would be down to recreate the ram it video  <BRK> that may or may not be the most important part of all of this  <BRK> ramsey ha barely been able to hide his feeling for his quarterback in the past  like when he liked an instagram post of a big cat country article on potential bortles replacement  <BRK> bruh pic twitter com wzs zpeftq <BRK> combine him with brown  who ha literally thrown a football at roethlisberger before  all that energy would have to make it way out into the open  and the idea of these two just dogging bortles is funny  <BRK> despite this offense not being even remotely a good a any of the one i ve already mentioned  and the likelihood that the jag dump bortles this offseaon  we re also here for the joke  <BRK> but nobody want to see that  <BRK>
