now that the sequel to space jam   starring lebron james and produced by black panther s ryan coogler   is in the work  we have so many question  the movie will releae on july      a announced by springhill ent <BRK> which player do you want to see in space jam   <BRK>a post shared by  sport blog nation   sbnation  on feb      at    pm pst<BRK>will swackhammer  the former leader of the nerdlucks monstars  return to seek revenge on the looney tune only to find out that there s a new crop of pro basketball legend waiting for them  will michael jordan make a cameo appearance  will every cartoon character now have access to a smartphone now that it s the future  <BRK>and a fantatic a it would be to see the original nba player show up   guy like charles barkley  patrick ewing  and muggsy bogues   we need some current star  so who should be in space jam    here are just a few suggestion for lebron and the crew to consider <BRK>hear me out  this is the best idea  kyrie s film uncle drew wa releaed in theater this summer so he already ha movie acting experience  lebron doe too  but he didn t play a role a crucial in trainwreck a kyrie played in uncle drew   kyrie would have the upper hand and be the leader on set   the thing he couldn t be with lebron on the court  those are some next level mind game  which irving would love <BRK>and we all know kyrie and lebron made up  and we know he love the drama <BRK>boban is already so tall  even for an nba player  that people already want to know what it feel like to walk in that      frame  that s just one step below stealing someone s talent  which how the nerdlucks transformed into the monstars  in the last movie the monstars voluntarily gave up the stolen talent after losing to the tune squad and later became friend them  so while the tiny multicolored alien probably won t steal talent this time around  some new villain will totally see boban and attempt it instead  <BRK>the first space jam introduced lola bunny to the looney tune world  and lola could hoop  unlike most of of the other tune squad player  during the pivotal game  she climbed the monstars  orange absolute unit of a leader and used his face a a diving board for an eay dunk  <BRK>but the sequel need more woman playing basketball  and no other athlete is better for the cast than candace parker  the spark star is already in los angeles  the   time wnba mvp and lebron can meet up and film part of it at staple center with ease  plus  parker ha already shown that she can take over the spotlight when needed based on her frequent appearance on nba on tnt and on kevin garnett s area    <BRK>and this wouldn t even be the first time that lebron and parker worked on a project together  parker wa a guest on lebron s hbo show the shop where she explained the sacrifice she had to make to balance her time a a mother and a a professional athlete  <BRK>joel embiid is charismatic a hell  and he probably ha a bright future in television once his playing day are over so why not start now  you know he s going to throw in  trust the process  in there somewhere and it ll be a huge hit for everyone in theater  his appearance is worth just that line  and he shouldn t even be the only  er player to make the cat  <BRK>before lebron announced he wa going to the laker  there wa a ton of speculation that he wa joining the philadelphia  er  part of that wa because he and ben simmons are friend  there have been a handful of instagram video with the two working out together  and just because lebron decided to head west doesn t mean this friendhip is over  they can continue that on the movie set  <BRK>lebron once compared ben simmons to himself  so he might make for the perfect player whose talent can be taken over by swackhammer and his new iteration of monstars  a scene where lebron a simmons talented monstar play one on one could be legendary <BRK>it s not a lebron james project without the help of james jones  just take a look at the majority of lebron s nba career  you re going to see the real king james by his side  jones wa with lebron for three championship run   two with the miami heat and one with the cavalier  give james jones the overlooked hero role in the movie and have him make the game winning shot  he might be busy nowadays given that he s the vice president of basketball operation for the phoenix sun  but it never hurt to ask  <BRK>also kevin hart will be in it  he ll play the same type of role wayne knight played in the original  book it <BRK>
