everything that happens from now on happens with  le than a month to go until selection sunday   and this weekend helped set a perfect stage for the regular season s final week   <BRK> here s everything you need to know about what went down on saturday and sunday   <BRK> the showcae game of the weekend took place saturday night in lexington  where no    kentucky led by a many a   and blated no    tennessee        <BRK> in a tilt loaded with player who are front runner for both sec and national honor  no one wa a bigger star than kentucky forward p j  wahington  the sophomore wa virtually unstoppable in the paint  connecting on   of his   field goal attempt and finishing with a game high   point   <BRK> the biggest difference for wahington this go round against tennessee a opposed to lat seaon wa the presence of front court teammate reid travis  the brawnier travis drew the defensive asignment of national player of the year candidate grant williams   who scored   point but attempted just four field goal   allowing wahington to conserve more energy and focus for the offensive end  in the two game against tennessee lat seaon where wahington wa forced to deal with williams on both end of the floor  he scored a total of nine point and didn t make a single shot from the field   <BRK> much ha been made of the fact that this wa tennessee s first game against a ranked opponent since knocking off gonzaga on dec     whether or not that wa a factor in saturday night s lopsided final score is impossible to know  but the volunteer will have plenty of opportunity to confirm or dispel the notion in the coming week  they ll head to baton rouge next saturday to face an lsu team that s now tied with them atop the sec standing at      and then host the return game against kentucky the saturday after that   <BRK> for kentucky  the victory not only put the wildcat within striking distance of both ut and lsu in the sec regular season championship race  but strengthens their case to be a no    seed in the ncaa tournament  the regular season series between the cat and the vols take on even more significance when you remember that the pair could be fighting for geographical preference on selection sunday in a year where columbus is hosting first and second round game and louisville will host a regional final    <BRK> shoutout to kentucky student mckinley webb for banging home this shot for      and then reacting exactly like you d expect a college student to react in that situation   <BRK> kentucky student hit a halfcourt shot on college gameday and celebrates like college kid celebrate   let s     ing go   pic twitter com uuieoj j <BRK> webb apologized on twitter minute later   <BRK> i m sorry for my language but i just got a bag <BRK> all good  my man   <BRK> no    michigan state outscored ohio state     in the second half on their way to a breezy      win over the buckeye on sunday afternoon  the bigger story wa on the spartan bench  where big man nick ward spent most of the game nursing an apparent hand injury   <BRK> hour after the game  michigan state sent out a release announcing that ward had sustained a hairline fracture of his left hand toward the end of the first half and that there s no timetable for his return  the release added that  it is hoped he will return before the end of the season    <BRK> the news would be brutal for tom izzo s club under any circumstance  but it s especially crushing when taking into account that the team wa just coming to term with being without josh langford for the rest of the season  the standout junior guard wa averaging     point      rebound and     assist before suffering a left foot injury  on jan    it wa announced that he would be out for the rest of       <BRK> averaging     point and     rebound per game  ward had finally morphed into the consistently reliable inside force spartan fan had been waiting to see for the past two season  without him  izzo will likely turn to sophomore xavier tillman      ppg     rpg  to step into the role of starting center  and will also ask starting senior forward kenny goins      ppg      rpg  to shoulder a healthy chunk of the offensive load ward is leaving behind   <BRK> the timing couldn t be worse for michigan state  which is tied with michigan atop the big ten standing and play the first of two showcase game against the wolverine this sunday   <BRK> playing just four day after it historic collapse against duke   the cardinal became the first team in ncaa history to blow a   point lead with le than   minute to play in regulation     just in case you spent the past week watching zero college basketball but decided to check out this post for fun   louisville nearly lost at home to clemson in a manner that would have arguably been even more soul crushing   <BRK> the cardinal led     with just   second to play when thing went bonkers inside the kfc yum  center once again  clemson s marcquise reed hit a deep three to cut the lead to four  after the tiger trapped u of l s dwayne sutton and retained possession after a jump ball  reed buried another ridiculous shot to trim the lead to one with     second to play   <BRK> that s when this happened   <BRK> i can t put this ending into word just watch pic twitter com  deu bxsz <BRK> jordan nwora s inbounds pas   intended for a falling sutton   wound up in the hand of reed  reed s potential game winner wa blocked by a quick reacting nwora  and john newman iii s putback attempt found nothing but iron  the final horn sounded and cardinal fan  understandably  couldn t find the energy to take their hand off the top of their head and clap  <BRK> this mark the third straight game that louisville ha had a sizable lead in the final minute of a game and wound up either losing or gifting their opponent an opportunity to win that they didn t deserve  the trend is undoubtedly troubling  especially considering how likely it is that the cardinal will be in a similar spot multiple time between now and the end of the season   <BRK> during campbell s     loss to presbyterian college saturday afternoon  camel star chris clemons became just the ninth player in the history of division i men s basketball to breach the     point mark for his college career  his     career point put him just one made three pointer away from passing hersey hawkins and moving into  th place on the all time scoring list  <BRK> currently the nation s leading scorer at     ppg  clemons finished saturday with a game high   point  it marked the sixth straight game in which the senior ha scored at least   point  <BRK> following the weekend s event  here s how the list of division i s top   all time leading scorer currently stand  <BRK>    pete maravich  lsu             point   freeman williams  portland state             point   lionel simmons  la salle             point   alphonso ford  mississippi valley state             point   doug mcdermott  creighton             point    harry kelly  texas southern             point   keydren clark  saint peter s             point   hersey hawkins  bradley             point   chris clemons  campbell    present        point   oscar robertson  cincinnati             point <BRK> it should be noted that the     point club will almost certainly be expanding to   member before the end of the     season  <BRK> south dakota state senior star mike daum currently sits at no    on the all time scoring list with     career point  his   point effort in south dakota state s     win over north dakota state moved him past alfredrick hughes on the all time scoring list  and also moved him within nine point of passing former kansa star current wake forest head coach danny manning  <BRK> here s how it happened  <BRK> david jenkins jr  s answered prayer kept the jackrabbit atop the summit league standing with an     mark  rival north dakota state dropped to     in league play   <BRK> it s not difficult to argue that the distinction of  best finish  belongs to iowa rutgers  which wrapped with a seemingly impossible bounce and a seemingly impossible bank in the span of four second   <BRK> you won t see an ending with crazier consecutive bounce    iowahoops get the most important roll  the last one  pic twitter com l ilwz yuw <BRK> that wa joe wieskamp banking in the game winner from an impossible angle and lifting the  st ranked hawkeyes to a     win  the shot also extended iowa s big ten winning streak to four game   <BRK> iowa now sits two game behind michigan and michigan state in the league standing  but end with a manageable six game stretch that doesn t include the wolverine  spartan or     purdue   <BRK> this should come a a surprise to absolutely no one  but the piece certainly appear to be falling into place for kansa to win at leat a share of the big   regular seaon title for a  th  th consecutive seaon  <BRK> first  the jayhawks avenged an upset loss at west virginia last month by smacking the mountaineer       for their third straight win on saturday  then ku got more help in the form of iowa state upsetting league leading kansa state on the road by    the result mean that kansa  which is now just a half game behind k state in the conference standing and host the wildcat next monday  is back to controlling it own destiny in the big   regular season race  if the jayhawks win out  they re guaranteed to win at least a share of consecutive title no     <BRK> kansa is currently starting four freshman  the jayhawks don t have a reliable post presence  udoka azubuike is done for the year  silvio de sousa isn t eligible until      lagerald vick is back home and still nobody know why  the team s second leading scorer over the past month wa redshirting when the calendar flipped to    it freshman guard have been inconsistent all season  bill self s fake hair controversy won t go away  and yet  this may happen for a  th straight year   <BRK> what is dead may never die   <BRK> quinnipiac senior guard cameron young set a metro atlantic athletic conference record by scoring   point in the bobcat      triple overtime win over siena on sunday  the point total wa the highest in division i this season  and the third highest of the last   year  young is also the first player in at least   year to post a double double of at least   point and at least   rebound  <BRK> young s performance overshadowed a   point effort from siena freshman jalen pickett  the two player combined to go   of   from beyond the arc and   of   from the free throw line   <BRK> this is the fan video of the year  <BRK> classic leonard hamilton and fsu  classless bunch of lowlife  this is going to come back to you and when the table are turned you re not going to like it  collegebasketball  collegehoops  bigten  big   acc  duke  georgiatech  fsu  louisville  cardinal  clemson pic twitter com iaoyo aax  <BRK> first of all  the hashtags  yes   <BRK> secondly  this is legitimately the worst moment in leonard hamilton s   year career a a head coach to be taking a run at his credential  florida state s blowout of gt wa it seventh win in a row  and the  noles are playing a well a just about anyone in the country  also  hamilton made a regional final for the first time lat seaon  and came within a couple of shot of upsetting michigan and crahing the final four  <BRK> finally  i m in awe of the fact that there s still a georgia tech fan invested enough in the     season to  a  get so worked up over something like this  and b  take the time to create a video to share those feeling with the world   <BRK> we can mock the hashtags and the overall message  but let s also be sure to give the guy a f ing medal when we re done  he s earned it   <BRK> sunday s most significant result came from inside madison square garden  where st  john s rallied from a many a   down to deal no    villanova a     defeat   <BRK> the rally got jumpstarted in the closing moment of the first half  when lj figueroa s   foot heave just before the buzzer cut the nova lead to   and immediately shifted momentum back to the home team for the first time since the opening tip   <BRK> justin simon with the heave  it go in and the johnny enter the locker room within     sjubb pic twitter com zaotryc bg <BRK>  we were screaming the whole way into the locker room    said st  john s guard mustapha heron after the game   <BRK> a     st  john s run in the middle of the second half spearheaded by figueroa  heron and shamorie pond  and a jay wright technical  proved to be the game s most crucial stretch  it also led to a win that solidified the johnny  ncaa tournament resume  and a defeat that dropped villanova even with marquette in the big east loss column  st  john s and seton hall  both at      are now then only two team in the conference besides the wildcat and golden eagle with league record above     <BRK> which would be a bigger deal if a majority of the country didn t already think that duke wa the no    team in the country and had been for a while   <BRK> zion williamson scored   point on   of   shooting a the blue devil coated to a     win over nc state saturday afternoon that moved them to     overall and     in the acc  coach k and company have now won   of their lat   home game against the wolfpack   <BRK> and since zion wa mentioned and this is a college basketball write up  i am contractually obligated to post at least one dunk video   <BRK> potential   no    pick zion williamson putting on a show here in warmups  pic twitter com x
