welcome to couldn t be me  a weekly advice column where i solicit your personal dilemma and help out a best a i can  have something i can help you with  find me  _zeets  <BRK> while watching tv last weekend  i saw one of the greatest athlete of our generation get publicly humiliated  it wa a reminder how unexpected such event can be and how they can happen to anyone  a few year ago  i wrote about my worst public humiliation  in which the person who would eventually become my best friend dunked on me  while wearing sandal  if you ve suffered through an incident like this   perhaps you ve dropped   quart of ranch on yourself   you know these episode can have an outsized and lifelong effect on the person who go through it  it can haunt people forever  and change how they look at themselves  but there are way to recover  and in this week s column  i hope to explore them      <BRK>  futuremovieking   hi  zito  i live and work in los angeles  and a few day ago  me and some of my coworkers  i wouldn t really call them friend  lost a basketball game against a really bad team when we were visiting new york city  we should have beaten them easily  but it hasn t been the best year for u  the fourth quarter especially wa bad for me  i missed   shot  and after we blew an   point lead with almost four minute remaining  i had a chance to win the game but my potentially game winning shot wa blocked by some irrelevant dude  who then pointed and laughed at me  how do i deal with the fact that the ending of my career is closer than i m comfortable with  and with the fact that i wa embarrassed by a guy whose career highlight will be that he blocked me   <BRK> cbm  well  if the block took place in a small arena or a private event  my advice would be to confiscate the tape and silence everyone who witnessed the embarrassment  but that s the act of a tyrant  not a good king  in this case  what you should remember is history will not remember the man who blocked you  his accomplishment will be buried under the sand of time  by the next year  this event will be forgotten  and he will go back to being a nobody  i assume that you re great and the only reason that this other individual is reveling in your humiliation is because he now feel accomplished   to even waste your thought on him is a denigration of what you have achieved  he life in new york  he s probably unhappy with himself anyway   <BRK> grant  hi zito   when  i wa a freshman in high school  i wa in a one act play  we were performing for my english clas  and some of the prettiest girl in my clas were front and center  long story short  i had to crawl around on stage shirtless a lot  my pant fell down  leaving me in compression short while i frantically tried to hold the costume pant up a i crawled  it did not go well     i ve thought about that at leat once a week ever since  and that wa   year ago   <BRK>  the play wa  medea  our director took a weird direction with it  made it very animalistic  i wa aegeus  and i wa only in it because i wa in debate and she taught both and suggested forced me into doing this play when the original actor dropped out or something  <BRK> cbm  i had to re read medea  both the seneca and euripedes version  because i wa so confused about which part had aegeus crawling on the ground  shirtless  a lot  i didn t find those scene   <BRK> regardless  it s impressive you managed to turn a tragedy about a woman who murder a bunch of people   including her own child   into a comedy about a king who can t keep his pant up  if this had happened when he wa alive  you might have managed to convince the comic poet of euripedes  time to appreciate him  <BRK> to be honest  if i wa in the audience when i wa in high school  i would have probably laughed at you  not the quiet laughter of someone who find the event funny but still want to respect the play and your feeling  but a nelson muntz  standing up and pointing  loud ha ha  the type of laughter that make you never wear want to wear pant again  you would have had to spend the next year of your life wearing onesies in order to cope with the pain  child are cruel   <BRK> but we re adult here  so  on a serious note  the late swedish director ingmar bergman once talked about how humiliation  or it shadow  is ever present during childhood   <BRK>  one of the strongest feeling i remember from my childhood is  precisely  of being humiliated  of being knocked about by word  act  or situation  isn t it a fact that child are always feeling deeply humiliated in their relation with grown ups and each other  i have a feeling child spend a good deal of their time humiliating one another  our whole education is just one long humiliation  and it wa even more so when i wa a child  one of the wound i ve found hardest to bear in my adult life ha been the fear of humiliation  and the sense of being humiliated  every time i read a review  for instance   whether laudatory or not   this feeling awakes  to humiliate and be humiliated  i think  is a crucial element in our whole social structure   <BRK> humiliation is a staple in bergman s film  his character are always being humiliated  usually up until the conclusion of the film when they have to reflect upon the lowly people they have become  they must then decide whether to destroy themselves completely  out of disgust for who they are  or accept that shame and humiliation do not define them  wah the pain away  and begin to live a a new person   <BRK> indulging in shame can be dangerous  a negative public event can trigger a person to close themselves off from the world  to truly experience all of life s wonder  and to see what your true capability are  you need to be vulnerable  to put yourself out there  and accept the real prospect of failure and public humiliation  a person can miss out on so much by protecting themselves from the laughter of others   <BRK> it s important to remind yourself  even now    year after the medea incident  that it doe not matter  the event and it effect are only real if you define yourself by it  you give it it power  those people you fell in front of  those pretty girl  no longer exist a they were back then  it s only you who is keeping them alive  the people they have become don t even remember what happened  because even though it wa an important moment for you  they don t have the same psychic attachment  they have their own humiliation  and humiliation is aymmetrical    <BRK> there are a few way to deal with the memory of public humiliation  you can wallow in it  which is self destructive and a wate of life  you can be like medea  who avenged her humiliation by destroying everything around her  my lawyer have asked me not to recommend this route   or you can be like the titular character of the emperor s new clothes  who wa fooled into thinking that he wa wearing a wonderful outfit when he wa actually naked  fear led the people around him to join in on the lie  until  during a procession  a small child shouted the truth  <BRK>  and one person whispered to another what the child had said   he hasn t anything on  a child say he hasn t anything on   <BRK>  but he hasn t got anything on   the whole town cried out at last  <BRK> the emperor shivered  for he suspected they were right  but he thought   this procession ha got to go on   so he walked more proudly than ever  a his nobleman held high the train that wan t there at all   <BRK> the procession  this life  must go on  you might a well walk proudly  <BRK>
