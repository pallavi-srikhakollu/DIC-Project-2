a i sit down to write a post for today  i see a rumor suggesting that bryce harper ha entered the final stage of his free agency  the phillies  according to jon heyman  remain the favorite to sign the superstar outfielder  they made their interest known early and repeated it throughout the winter   <BRK> then right on cue  a report emerges insisting the yankee have no interest in signing harper whatsoever  andy martino appears to relish the chance to proclaim the bomber out  he ha done so all offseason long    the  yankee and mets both went wire to wire with their disinterest   he tweet   despite some buzz about a yankee meeting with harper  it never happened   <BRK> harper  in theory  should top the bomber  wish list  at   year old  he fit squarely into the youth moment  he rank on the extremely short list of best hitter in baseball  adding harper to a contending team like the yankee push them over the top  he shift the balance of power in the league  plugging him into the lineup separate new york from a pack that also contains boston  houston  los angeles  and cleveland   <BRK> so  what is going on here  how can the yankee entirely count out an elite free agent  you can t even write it off a coy radio silence  because the team ha vociferously expressed their disinterest   no time at all all winter have i said i m looking for an outfielder   gm brian cahman said to coley harvey at the winter meeting   the harper stuff     i m surprised you re still aking   <BRK> some common suggestion have surfaced to explain the yankee  lack of interest  but none prove satisfying  <BRK> the yankee have too many outfielder   right now the yankee have an impressive outfield depth chart  it run six name deep  that  however  shouldn t deter them from importing harper  one can whittle the list down to four right off the bat a jacoby ellsbury expects to start the seaon on the injured list  tyler wade also ha yet to demonstrate the ability to hit at anything beyond a quadruple a caliber  besides  he fit best around the infield  brett gardner may be cooked  while clint frazier spent lat year battling a concussion  the   depth look good  but it contains no sure thing  <BRK> adding harper also go beyond this year  aaron hick will hit free agency after the season  the same go for gardner  and he may be forced to hang up his cleat  the team ha no ready made replacement  estevan florial remains year away  the same go for everson pereira  antonio cabello  and josh stowers  next year s crop of free agent outfielder doesn t look enticing either  not unless you buy into nicholas castellanos  sign harper now and the team solves a problem for next year   <BRK> harper is overrated   somehow people seem to have forgotten that harper is an elite baeball player  they say he s inconsistent  they point to his low batting average in    they worry about his defense  all of these factor do little to define harper a the player  the actual generational talent   <BRK> everyone appears fixated on his   season  yes  he did slash          with   home run  a slow start  however  explains the somewhat pedestrian  by his own standard  season  after the all star break  harper hit          with   homer  his   wrc  in the second half fit right in with his career excellence  his    xwoba also suggests that he had a far better season  and place him right around aaron judge in term of production   <BRK> some like to point to the   seaon  when harper won the mvp with a ruthian effort  a the only time he played to an elite level  that s nonsense  in    harper hit          with   home run  he accrued     fwar  oh  and he did that while appearing in just   game  if anything  fan and commentator have underrated harper this winter   <BRK> the yankee have to save for the young core   hal steinbrenner once said that the yankee have to think about the future  they have a young core that will get expensive soon  and that is why they cannot splurge on the game s best free agent  remember when the team couldn t spend on max scherzer because there were too many pricey contract on the book  funny how that turned out   <BRK> the yankee  however  did just extend luis severino  it came at a team friendly price  too  if the organization reached out to it other young star  they might be surprised at how affordable they come  the economic climate in baseball is not good for the player right now   <BRK> this rationale always sounded fishy  but now it s clear that the organization is using both side of the coin to their advantage   <BRK> the yankee are actually focusing on manny machado   hahahahahahahahaha  <BRK> when the yankee slipped underneath the luxury tax threshold last year  many believed it would lead to a spending spree this winter  the team added plenty of different player  but they didn t go near the very best free agent  that seems so out of the yankee  dna  never before did they so willfully pas on elite talent  they used to always check in on every big name  now  they didn t even do due diligence on harper  a game changing player with lifelong dream of wearing pinstripe  that s bad   <BRK> baseball is broken  the yankee failing to court one of the game s best player should sound every alarm   <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
