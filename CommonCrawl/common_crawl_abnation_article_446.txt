neither barry bond nor roger clemens were elected to the national baseball hall of fame on tuesday  both falling short of the required    of the vote from the baseball writer association of america  but both saw gain in support but small one  leaving only a trace of hope that at some point in the next three year they could find their way to cooperstown  <BRK> clemens wa named on      of the submitted ballot while bond received       falling   and   vote shy  respectively  <BRK> this is up from      for clemens and      for bond in    and continues a path of steady growth in their time on the bbwaa ballot  <BRK> there are still gain to be made for bond and clemens  but only three year to get to the required     after   year on the bbwaa ballot  player are no longer eligible to be voted in by the writer  they fall into what used to be known a the veteran s committee  a much more intimate selection process with a   person panel of hall of famers and contributor throughout the game  <BRK> with their primary contribution falling mostly from   to the present  both bond and clemens fall under the today s era committee  should they not reach    by their  th election  in    the next time that committee hold a vote is two year later  for the   class  <BRK>

   <BRK> but for now  let s focus on the bbwaa selection process  with three more year remaining for clemens and bond  <BRK>  vote this guy in   hall of famer willie may said in august   at bond  number retirement ceremony with the giant  <BRK>  give somebody honor that deserves to be in the hall of fame   may said   the hall of fame is a type of fraternity that  when you get there  you ll say   man  how did i get here   and i want him to have that honor be something that happens to him    <BRK> bond won seven most valuable player award and clements won seven cy young award  both top in major league history  they are widely considered two of the greatest player in the history of baseball  on pure number alone  they would be inner circle hall of famers  <BRK> nobody ha more home run     or walk       in baseball history than bond  who also rank third all time in run scored        he is the only player ever with   home run and   stolen base  but bond surpassed even that by establishing the     club  clemens rank third all time in strikeout       and his ninth best all time win total     is only matched once in the last   year  <BRK>  barry bond and roger clemens should be in   said reggie jackson  a   inductee to the hall of fame  in an interview with nick cafardo of the boston globe   it s time   <BRK> but here we are  seven year into their cooperstown eligibility and they are still on the outside looking in  thanks to link to performance enhancing drug  <BRK> neither failed a drug test  though mlb didn t institute a testing policy until    bond testified in   that he unknowingly took a clear substance and a cream from a trainer who wa indicted in the government s investigation into steroid distribution from the bay area based balco  clemens wa named throughout the   mitchell report commissioned by mlb  in which his former personal trainer and yankee trainer brian mcnamee said he injected clements multiple time with winstrol  <BRK> both bond and clemens were indicted for perjury and obstruction of justice regarding testimony about their alleged steroid use  bond wa convicted of obstruction of justice in    though the conviction wa overturned by an appeal court three year later  clemens wa found not guilty of lying to congress in    <BRK> roy halladay  a posthumous inductee to the hall of fame this year in his first time on the ballot  made his stance on bond and clemens known in    <BRK> when you use peds you admit your not good enough to compete fairly  our nation past time should have higher standard  no clemens no bond  <BRK> clemens called the statement  asinine  and alleged that a strength coach once accused halladay of taking amphetamine  in this game  there is no high road  <BRK> though bond and clemens have made a substantial push in recent year  there are only three year remaining on the writer  ballot to get to      <BRK> the gain of the last few year have come from two source   increased support from new hall of fame voter  and a recent culling of the electorate  <BRK> in   the hall of fame made an important change to it voting process  culling the field of eligible bbwaa voter to essentially only active or recently active member  bbwaa member who haven t covered the game in over   year were no longer eligible for a hall vote  a departure from the previous policy of giving long retired writer a ballot  <BRK> the effect wa drastic  with   total ballot received for the   election trimmed down to just   in    that number ha been fairly steady since  including   ballot received this year   <BRK> the first time hall of fame voter   those who have reached   year in the bbwaa   from   to now have showed strong support for both clemens and bond  out of   first timer in the last three election    voted for clemens        and   voted for bond         <BRK> from a very simplified perspective  the voting pool ha replaced an older group much le likely to vote for bond or clemens with voter who will support their cooperstown candidacy  <BRK> of the   hall of fame voter who made their vote public  both bond and clemens received   vote         but from anonymous bbwaa voter their support is dramatically worse        for clemens and      for bond  <BRK> even if     see the same surge of first time voter support for bond and clemens that they got the last three year  it won t be enough  if  hypothetically    new voter all replace  no  vote in the next three election    more vote for clemens would put him at a still short       with   more bond vote would put him at       <BRK> in other word  clemens and bond will need some current voter to change their mind  <BRK> will bond and clemens receive that same late surge  or will  no  voter remain staunch in their ped rebuke  there ha been very little normal about either the career and hall voting for clemens and bond  so it isn t a eay to predict  <BRK> historically  player who get a close to    a bond and clemens are nearing do receive a final surge in their lat few year on the ballot  we saw it recently with bert blyleven in   elected in his penultimate year on the ballot  then with tim raines in   and edgar martinez this year get into cooperstown in their final year of bbwaa eligibility  <BRK> we have three more year to find out if bond and clemens can make that final push  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
