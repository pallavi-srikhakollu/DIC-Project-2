i am a transplant to the south side of chicago  having moved to the city in    coming from indianapolis  a city without a major league team  i wa delighted to fall under the spell of the white sox   <BRK> my grandfather introduced me to the old ballpark in the   s  bringing my brother  my sister  and me to game once a year or so  but while i followed a number of white sox player in my childhood and youth  i wa not specifically a white sox fan  of course  i wa not specifically a fan of any one team outside of our aaa indianapolis indian  coming to the south side allowed me to start coming to game regularly  and in short order i came to love the sox   <BRK> i have nothing but joyful memory of the   seaon  a i m sure you do  too  while i can only imagine the happiness the world series championship brought lifelong fan  several of whom are regular here on this site  i did get to experience that flag with the zeal of the newly converted  i like to think that  along with my continued  ever growing love of the team and the city over the ensuing decade plus allows me some latitude on writing to you this way   <BRK> i am not what you would probably call a  superfan   i bring my family to game several time a season  but i have never bought season ticket  i own some white sox merchandise  a few t shirt  a couple of hat  but i m not a huge spender on memorabilia or replica jersey and such  i have never been to white sox spring training  we all eat  and eat pretty well  at game  but i don t drink  so am not buying expensive beer  nor do i spend extra for party pavilion and so forth   <BRK> still  i am an avid fan  and do spend money that i assume go to support the team  i spend a lot of time reading  and some measurable time writing  about the team  like most fan  i probably care more about the team than would seem logical to an outsider  at the same time  i know many people who invest much  much more of themselves  emotionally and psychologically  in the sox  call me a small time investor  if you like   <BRK> i am a white sox fan and supporter  i want to fully embrace the team  it vision  and it practice  i wish the team nothing but success  however  the event of this week have hit me with more impact than i might have guessed  <BRK> i am  and have been  a supporter of the attempt to rebuild the team  while i wa sorry to see player like chris sale  jose quintana and adam eaton leave  i understood the rationale behind the move and ultimately applauded them  the young player that came back in those trade make me excited for the future  their struggle and injury  while at time frustrating to me a a fan  don t in any way deter my excitement about the future of the white sox  <BRK> what ha thrown up an obstacle  though  is the event of the past few day   <BRK> at first  i wan t certain that pursuing either manny machado or bryce harper wa the best approach for the team to take  but talking with other sox fan  reading what still others had to say  i became convinced that the team wa making a smart move by actively and aggressively going after these two generational  and i don t use the term lightly  talent  their relative youth a free agent  both just really entering their professional prime  and the particular talent they posse made them perfect fit  major piece who would be with the sox a the team build toward contention and establishes itself a a perennial contender  both are great talent who could be in it for the long haul a the young talent matured around them   <BRK> that the sox were aggressively going after them made me  a a fan  very happy  that the sox lost out on them  in and of itself  disappoints me  but it doen t bother me or deter my excitement about the future  what doe  however  is some of what ha come out in the aftermath  you see  it isn t so much that the sox missed out  it s how the sox missed out   <BRK> on tuesday  ken williams said   evidently     million is  what it took  and san diego stepped up to that level  that level wasn t feasible to u  becaue we still have to project putting together a total winning roster   <BRK> rick hahn said   the sox offer did not have an out clause  the organization doe not believe in that philosophy   <BRK> to a fan  these statement are disturbing   <BRK> i m of both humble origin and present circumstance  and wouldn t normally presume to tell you how to run a business  you know vatly more about that than i do  but whether or not the above quote are a direct reflection of your decision making  or are your employee  interpretation of it  a the owner the buck stop with you  <BRK> we both know that building an ongoing  competitive baseball team start with an organizational foundation of good  young talent  deep enough to weather injury and some player falling short of expectation  it should also be deep enough  and spread widely enough  to create a pipeline of talent  with new player coming along at a regular clip  this is an important base for creating a team that can compete for an extended period  this is  in theory  what we all want  extended  ongoing competitiveness   <BRK> at the same time  homegrown talent alone cannot possibly allow a team to achieve that  if we look at any long term competitive team  we know that regardless of how many ballplayer come through their system  they still have to supplement those player from outside of the system to fill hole  bolster lineup  put together a deep pitching staff  be it the recent success of the astros  cub  and brewer  or the traditional power like the yankee and dodger  they have to supplement  and that includes the up and comer  like the brave  the padre  the phillies  and   yes   the white sox   <BRK> now  trade are nice  and often prudent  you take asset you are long on and turn them into what you lack  the white sox may soon be at the point of having excess asset  and in the right circumstance  the sox could trade some of these young asset for proven quality to fill a hole at the major league level  but trade alone are inadequate for putting together a long term  competitive team  looking over the landscape of today s game  this is pretty self evident  <BRK> putting together a competitive team for the long haul requires going out and buying some aset  and like with most aset  the good one don t come cheap  you can certainly shop in the discount department and clearance rack and find an occaional short term solution  a a sox fan  i ve seen a lot of that over the pat decade plus  some of these bargain have panned out  most have not  but the point is  to build a quality team today mean being willing to pay market value for aset you need  and this is why ken and rick s quote above are so disconcerting   <BRK> anyone can be outbid  even the yankee  dodger and cub  so can the white sox  i get that  but what i don t get is creating an organizational philosophy and guideline that automatically pre empt being able to sign the best of the best  and while certainly harper  and perhaps more so machado  are among the best of the best  they are not alone at that level   <BRK> next year  more  best  player will become available  perhaps not with the added benefit of just entering their prime  but certainly a number of top shelf baeball player will be looking to be compensated at market value  unfortunately  a a sox fan  i m now working under the impression that these top player will no longer be available to my team  while i can accept that the sox missed out on machado and harper  it s hard to stomach that they ve removed themselves from consideration for say  nolan arenado and paul goldschmidt or whomever becomes available a a free agent over the next few year   the year in which we are told the sox will be competitive  chaing the playoff and the world series   <BRK> the unwillingness of the team to do what s necessary  what other team are willing to do  in order to secure the best player is troubling  not only doe this preclude the sox signing major talent  but it raise the question of what will become of our young  talented  homegrown player a they mature  excel  and face their own free agency decision in the future   <BRK> doe this philosophy of not meeting the upper end of the market  or offer option  which have become commonplace in modern contract   mean that michael kopech and eloy jim√©nez are simply going to  age out  of the white sox  lost to the team if they grow into the top shelf player we all hope they become   <BRK> a a fan  am i destined to either accept an occaional fling at competing for a playoff spot or go hunt up some other team to follow and support   one that is willing to do what s necessary to attract and retain quality talent   <BRK> i don t want to do that  mr  reinsdorf  i realize that all sport fandom is  to some extent simply rooting for a particular pile of laundry  but i ve embraced the sox  come to love them  and really want to see them become a long term  competitive team  maybe that s just too bad for me  i don t know  <BRK> i ve been reading and hearing all kind of vitriol directed at you  call for you head  some pathetic folk out there are publicly hoping you ill will to the point of death  i m sure you re not deaf to all that silliness  and that s what it is  silliness laced with malice  i have no truck with that kind of vicious ignorance  and condemn it   <BRK> nor do i wave my arm and insist that you sell the team immediately  nor do i insist that you fire all of the front office staff tomorrow  or whatever  i m not going to boycott the team  stop going to game  burn my t shirt  or any of that  disappointed and concerned a i am  i really don t want to stop being an active chicago white sox fan  <BRK> what i do want  though  is for you to take stock of what the business of baseball requires today in order to field a competitive team over the long haul  some of those thing  you are doing   amassing a deep pool of young talent and potential  for example   <BRK> but particularly regarding these rare  golden opportunity  you need to reassess  if the white sox are going to succeed with the rebuilding you have undertaken  you cannot settle for half measure  being unwilling to adopt market practice that nearly all of your competitor have embraced is a recipe for continued mediocrity  empty stand  and a tired  disillusioned  and ever shrinking fan base   <BRK> i know that there are many way for the team to keep making money that don t require fielding a competitive team or filling the stadium  i don t like it  but i know it s a reality  but many year ago  you bought this team with something more in mind than just making money  i urge you to recall and rekindle what that something more wa  and do what s necessary to bring it to fruition   <BRK> yours   <BRK> katiesphil  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
