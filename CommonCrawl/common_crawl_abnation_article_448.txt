the houston rocket clinched their seventh consecutive playoff berth after last night s win over the new orleans pelican  which tie two other stretch of appearance for the most in franchise history  it s a record of consistency and success that rocket fan primarily owe to their two main franchise cornerstone  daryl morey and james harden  <BRK> morey wa brought in in   after the departure of long time franchise staple carrol dawson  and although he oversaw the final hurrah of the yao mcgrady year  it wan t long before morey wa tasked with rebuilding the team following the infamous decline of houston s star duo   <BRK> while the rocket would miss the playoff for three straight seaon from      the houston gm wa developing his  moreyball  strategy while he waited for the opportunity to grab an ever elusive superstar  but even though morey s vision wa unfulfilled without a star player  we saw the beginning of what we know a his full fledged philosophy today  <BRK> he prized efficiency  bringing in guy like kevin martin  who s three ball and free throw heavy game wa actually a few year ahead of it s time  even if martin wan t the guy to fully actualize it  and morey also had head start on player like goran dragic  garrett temple  and kyle lowry  even if they wound up finding their greatest success with other team  <BRK> morey kept the franchise afloat through the three non playoff year  never suffering a losing record in any of them  never tanking  and always keeping the team competitive despite a slew of mid first round draft pick and nothing near the top  he wa expertly biding his time until the moment would arrive for a franchise changing move   <BRK> the moment finally came on october       when morey traded martin  jeremy lamb  two first round pick and a second round pick to the oklahoma city thunder for james harden and filler  harden wa coming off a campaign in which he won sixth man of the year and helped lead the thunder to the nba final  and a he wa about the grow into his physical prime  morey saw the potential for the superstar he so coveted   <BRK> and it wa the perfect marriage between player and franchise  harden wanted a chance to be  the man   and the rocket were willing to give him that shot  and their gm s philosophy of either shooting a three or getting to the bucket and drawing a foul in the process meshed perfectly with harden s skill set  and the result were instantaneous  <BRK> the rocket were back in the postseaon in harden s first year with the club  finishing      and harden averaged almost   point per game in his first year a a full time starter  and that wa just the tip of the iceberg  a morey finally had the big gun he desired and could build the ancillary player accordingly   <BRK> even in the ultimately failed dwight howard signing  d  wa brought in because of how well he fit next to harden on paper  everyone just under estimated his childishness and overestimated his willingness to run the pick and roll  but even the howard signing  despite dissolving into dysfunction  reached a high water mark of the western conference final in    <BRK> the howard situation  despite ending negatively  showed off morey s ability to adjust his plan after a failure  a the houston gm built around the beard in a different way  first  he brought in head coach mike d antoni  it wa a move widely panned by many  including possibly even this website at the time  but morey proved once again why he s often the smartest guy in the room and a perfect fit for this franchise   <BRK> d antoni s confidence in his player and the freedom he afforded them on the court wa another perfect  glove like fit  and harden immediately responded to a somewhat controversial  at least nationally  move to point guard with his finest statistical season of his career to that point  averaging   point    rebound and   assist   <BRK> a disappointing loss in the playoff to the san antonio spur sparked another morey materpiece  a he swung a mega deal in the next offseaon for future hall of fame point guard chris paul  with plenty of question whether cp  and the beard could share and share alike one mealy ball  the pair instead made beautiful music together  leading the rocket to a franchise best   win and were a singular pulled hamstring away from a likely nba title   <BRK> all this time  harden continued to grow a player  adding more to his game each and every seaon  he took the criticism of his defense to heart  making dratic improvement to his play on that end  while the addition of paul a another playmaker gave harden the freedom to develop the game s most devatating offensive repertoire  the maturation of clint capela   a morey draft pick  into a pick and roll nightmare for the opposition only made harden that much more effective a a scorer   <BRK> the beard won the   mvp award  but jut when you thought it might have been harden s pinnacle  he took thing to another level this year  we ve been over his contribution endlessly here at tds  and i think conrad pretty much laid it all out for u this weekend  but he s having the most dominant offensive season we ve seen in the nba for decade   <BRK> a for morey  he once again showed an uncanny ability to move on from a failure  essentially wiping clean a failed offseaon of carmelo anthony  james ennis  and michael carter williams and turning them into danuel house  austin river  kenneth faried  and iman shumpert  it wa an epic mid seaon pivot by the gm  and that along with harden s record setting nightly supernova saved houston s seaon  they now stand on the precipice of a top three seed in the brutal western conference  <BRK> it seems extremely silly now  but there were legitimate question after houston s     start about the direction of this team s future  new owner tillman fertitta wa a bit of a wildcard in these matter  but that wa laid all to rest after morey s expert mid seaon maneuvering and fertitta offering up a deserved five year extension a a reward  <BRK> morey s now signed through    while james harden is on board until at leat    which is good news for rocket fan  because houston is        percent  since morey took over a gm lat decade  crazy    and they re        percent  since trading for harden  they ve exceeded   win in four of harden s six seaons  with the same number just three win away this year with eight game remaining   <BRK> this seven season playoff streak now tie them with the group from     and the group from      coincidentally both involving the last rocket all time super great  sorry yao and t mac  love you both  but you re not quite on that level   <BRK> it can t be easy living in the shadow of hakeem olajuwon  rudy t  and le alexander  but the only thing left for this group to achieve is an nba title   <BRK> they have been close  twice advancing to the western conference final where they would lose to an all time great team  certainly no shame in that   and something tell me the championship title part of this story is very  very far from finished   the rocket have legitimate championship aspiration this year  no one s playing better ball since the all star break   and their key player gm duo is locked up well into the next decade  <BRK> though with how perfect a fit both of these guy are for the city  the team  the fan  and for each other  i wouldn t be surprised to see either one of them stay around even longer  harden love houston  and houston love the beard  a case of a city and it s superstar with legit feelsies for one another   <BRK> and of course no one can deny the one indomitable truth we all know a rocket fan  in morey we trust  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
