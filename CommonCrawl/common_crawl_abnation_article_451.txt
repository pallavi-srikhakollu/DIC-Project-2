zion williamson is too smart to overhype his round of   matchup against the university of central florida  but sunday evening s matchup will bring a chance for duke s superstar to create his single best highlight  <BRK> if you know nothing about ucf basketball  you aren t alone  the american athletic conference s third best team went     entering the tournament with a so so resume  their signature win came in early march over houston  but they lost a couple bad one to florida atlantic and wichita state  they re a fine team with one major presence  who could become zion s biggest threat at the rim      tacko fall  <BRK> if you haven t seen tacko  here s all of him  <BRK> and here he is next to basketball reporter tracy wolfson  <BRK> look how tall tacko fall is      ucf_mbb  pic twitter com kihncn xun <BRK> tacko is the tallest player in the ncaa tournament  and he ha equal chance at becoming zion s greatest nightmare a he doe zion s greatest poster  <BRK> fall wa asked by the ncaa s andy katz about his matchup with zion  and fall said  it s very hard  to dunk on me    i mean  i won t allow it  i won t allow it  i won t allow  zion  putting me on one of his highlight tape   <BRK>  i won t allow it  i won t allow him to put me on one of his highlight tape  after advancing past vcu   ucf_mbb s tacko fall tell  theandykatz he won t allow zion to dunk on him   marchmadness pic twitter com pimxp ikfj <BRK> williamson wa asked about those comment at a press conference  to which he responded   what is  fall  supposed to say  is he supposed to say like i m going to dunk on him  he said the right thing  but i m not really focused on that  i m just focused on trying to help my team win the game    <BRK> neither guy want to make their team s matchup into a tacko v  zion one  but that s the show we re all really waiting on  <BRK>

   <BRK> zion ha definitely never faced a presence quite like fall s  he s not only nearly a foot taller than williamson  who is      but he weighs   pound more      he s a truly massive rim protector  and block     percent of shot when he s on the floor  that s the no    rate in the country  and total to     per night in just   minute per game  if someone can send a zion dunk backwards  it s fall  <BRK> on the flip side  if zion can pull off dunking on the largest player in the tourney  who stand   inch taller  it ll be his signature moment  it ll prove nobody is safe  a fall would make the tallest player in the nba a well   <BRK> this is goliath v  an even bigger goliath  <BRK> anything can happen  but probably not  duke rank in kenpom s top   in both offense and defense  whereas ucf is no    and no    respectively  the blue devil have multiple first round nba draft pick  and ucf doesn t have one  fall isn t mobile enough to hang seriously at the next level   <BRK> but we ve already seen uc irvine top kansa state  and liberty top mississippi state  we re just a year removed from umbc over virginia  <BRK> it s all possible unless zion windmill over tacko  then it s time to stop believing anyone can beat duke with that guy healthy  <BRK>
