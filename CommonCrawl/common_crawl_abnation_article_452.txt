dayton   at around   p m  on tuesday night  prairie view a m coach byron smith took his seat on the dais for his team s postgame press conference  to his right  senior dennis jones and gary blackston  to his left  the moderator  <BRK> the four looked out at a sea of   empty seat and just two reporter  two reporter out of   credentialed medium at the first four wanted to hear from the team that lost the first game of the   ncaa tournament  smith gave a brief opening statement  then one reporter asked the player one question  and they were dismissed  the same reporter asked smith two question before the coach walked off the stage  his head down and the only sound coming from ambient crowd noise filtering in from the arena bowl a few foot away  <BRK> prairie view had it two hour on the national stage  but a soon a the final buzzer sounded in an     loss to fairleigh dickinson  the panther faded back into obscurity   <BRK> they ll lose blackston  jones  and fellow senior iwin elli and taishaun johnson next year  meaning they ll also lose   percent of their scoring  they likely won t be favored to repeat in the swac  meaning this could be the least we hear from the historically black college  hbcu  from prairie view  texas for quite some time  <BRK> we will  however  probably see the swac champion right back in dayton next year  <BRK> the swac is one of two division i conference comprised entirely of hbcus  the meac is the other   and both routinely rank among the worst men s basketball league in the country  consequently  the conference champion are often sent to dayton to play in the first four  which is reserved for the worst four automatic qualifier and worst four at large team each year    <BRK> since the first four wa added to the ncaa tournament in    at least one hbcu ha been sent there every season  from   to    it wa either the meac or swac champion  the last two year  it ha been both  <BRK> for many hbcus  the problem come down to a lack of resource  prairie view a m athletic director fred wahington explained that his school is defined a a limited resource institution  lri   which mean it rank in the bottom   percent in division i athletics spending   <BRK> he say that one area where his duty differ significantly from ad at other university is the lack of depth to his staff  for example  while some school have academic advisor or tutor dedicated specifically to one team or sport  advisor at prairie view are spread thin  meaning they cannot offer the same type of specialized academic help that others can  even at the mid major level  naturally  this also mean le money to spend on facility and athletics staff  putting lris at a competitive disadvantage  and yet  washington point out that fan still expect the same level of on court success that other university can achieve  <BRK> when usa today published reported athletic finance from      it showed that out of   school to report data  nine of the bottom   in athletic revenue were from hbcus  <BRK> it s a problem that feed itself  hbcus are not competitive in men s baketball and football   the two major revenue sport   relative to their peer  and so they do not make a much money in television deal or through fan support  swac commissioner charles mcclelland explains that part of his job is making sure he can secure additional sponsorship   while squeezing every lat dollar he can out of existing partnership   in order to bridge the gap between his school and other mid major  <BRK> it doesn t help  he say  that each swac school is a public university  meaning they are state funded  but they are not the flagship university for the state  so they do not take priority  <BRK> it s part of the reason he seemed thrilled to have prairie view a m in dayton  <BRK> fan may view being relegated to the first four a an insult  national medium that only swoop into the college baketball world a conference play heat up may brush it off a not a true tournament site  <BRK> the reality is more complicated than that  particularly for the   seed  and even more so for hbcus    <BRK> there s a financial aspect that make athletic director and conference commissioner particularly drawn to dayton  simply put  the more game that a team play in the ncaa tournament  the more money it make  <BRK> a portion of the money that the ncaa make from the tournament is given back to each division i conference in distribution via the baketball performance fund that it call  unit   unit are allocated baed on the number of game each conference play in the tournament  excluding the first game for the automatic qualifier and the national championship game  the automatic qualifier earns the equivalent of one unit  however  out of something called the equal conference fund  which function the same way a the baketball performance fund   <BRK> so merely by appearing in the tournament  a school receives one unit for it conference  a win mean another game and therefore another unit  the value of a unit change year to year but will be      in    and those unit are good for six year   <BRK> so  for example  umbc s two tournament game played last year mean two unit for the america east per season over the next six year  that come out to over    million  plus all the unit they compile in the meantime  conference then distribute payouts to their school based on their bylaw  <BRK> therein lie the advantage to playing in dayton  a virtual coin flip game against an equally matched opponent that could result in doubling a conference s payout  <BRK>  any time you have the opportunity to play on national tv  where if you win you get the extra unit and move on  i d rather play in that game than to get a regular   seed and go play duke and kentucky straight out of the gate   mcclelland said  <BRK> the first four also offer something that other tournament site cannot  a solo position in the spotlight  prairie view a m s game against fairleigh dickinson wa the first in the ncaa tournament  airing at     p m  et on trutv  with no other game going on  the panther had center stage  for north carolina central  it wa the next night  at the same time  <BRK>  oftentimes baketball is considered the front porch to allow others to come in and see the different program and the type of education and law degree that we have to offer a well   nc central coach levelle moton said   so  we re doing it for the totality of the university   <BRK> wahington saw the benefit to the increased exposure even before the game wa played  <BRK>  i don t think we can buy the level of marketing that we are getting out of competition at this level   he said   in houston alone there are six or seven organized watch party  and on campus there s an organized watch party  that doesn t even touch the remote area where we have alumnus   <BRK> the computer say that  at least this year  the two hbcu participant were the worst in the field  prairie view a m ranked  th in kenpom  ahead of only nc central  which wa  rd  no metric is perfect  but based on what the committee had available  sending prairie view and nc central to dayton wa probably the right call  still  moton see an inherent disadvantage for school at nc central s level in compiling a resume  <BRK> nc central played eight road game this season before conference play began  going      that included loss at clemson  cincinnati  george mason  and saint louis   all team that operate at a significantly higher level  in return for going on the road and losing by double digit to ncaa powerhouse  nc central get a check from the hosting university  these are called  guarantee game  and are a necessity for nearly most low major school  especially for hbcus  <BRK> prairie view did not play a home game against a division i opponent this season until jan     it came into that game just     with a season opening win at santa clara and one at home to naia hutson tilloston  to the panther  credit  they did not get run off the court in many game  they lost by just   at baylor and georgia tech  by eight at unc greensboro  and by   at murray state   <BRK> nevertheless  their team sheet included six quadrant three loss  five of them came in the non conference  and one loss in quadrant four  a guarantee game at eat carolina   their loss at texa southern wa their only conference game that did not qualify a a quadrant four contest  so they had just a few realistic opportunity to gain any win that would set it apart from other   or   seed  <BRK> moton acknowledged that under the current system  there isn t much that could be done about that  either on the team side  or with how the committee evaluates   though he did say he hoped committee member would be more open minded about hbcus in the future  he also had another suggestion  to make the first four an event that only feature the final eight at large team  rather than a mix of at large and automatic qualifier  <BRK>  let them come here because they get an opportunity to buy game and they get an opportunity to have a little more utopia  a little more privilege in what they re doing   he said  <BRK> that idea might benefit coach and player because it would give the smaller school an immediate opportunity to knock off a power conference school rather than first requiring a win against another team that operates far off the national radar  convincing commissioner and athletic director that it s worth forfeiting a tournament unit  however  may be more difficult  <BRK> though both the swac and meac left dayton with loss  they each got the spotlight  they got fair matchup and good game  prairie view a m came out of the gate against fdu and forced nine turnover in the first   minute  showing the world it trademark high energy defense  it even built a pair of   point lead before the knight came storming back  a for north carolina central  it lost a first four game for the third year in a row  this one coming despite holding a five point lead with     to go  <BRK> so the swac and the meac are done for the year and the work begin anew for each program a they look to get back to the ncaa tournament  if you don t see them in dayton in    it ll probably be another pair of hbcus  <BRK>
