antonio brown keep inching toward his seemingly unavoidable departure from pittsburgh  year of veiled trade threat boiled over at the end of a tumultuous   season  and now his desire for a deal to free him from the steelers is so undeniable even team owner art rooney seems to agree   but only for the right price <BRK>that mean a four time first team all pro is on the trading block  and it s unclear what exactly the steelers are expecting in exchange for the second most prolific wideout in franchise history  other than  significant compensation   the   year old s past production suggests he s worthy of a khalil mack  two first round pick haul  but brown s age  reported locker room issue throughout his pittsburgh tenure  and recent demand for a restructured contract with more guaranteed money will dull the luster of the offer rooney s team receives <BRK>so who can come up with the best offer for a man with     receiving yard and   touchdown over his last six season  here are all   of brown s possible suitor  sorted by their combination of tradable asset  need  available cap space  and chance of landing him <BRK>   indianapolis colt <BRK>the colt are loaded cap space and trade capital  with nine pick in the upcoming draft  that includes the jet  second round pick  which the colt extracted from them after moving back from no    to no    in last year s draft  brown and t y hilton would give indianapolis one of the league s most devastating one two punch at receiver  <BRK><BRK>   san francisco  er<BRK>the  er are the odds on favorite to land brown  who would immediately become their top wideout  plus  brown ha openly flirted with the team <BRK>   new york jet<BRK>the jet have typically been linked to brown s teammate le veon bell  but adding a playmaker to sam darnold s arsenal would boost one of the league s most anonymous receiving corp  <BRK>   oakland     raider<BRK>jon gruden spent his first seaon a raider head coach trading player for draft asets  with three first round pick    may signal a switch in strategy a he look to build his roster with a few marketable star in advance of it   la vega debut  adding brown would also fill a need   of which the raider have many <BRK>   buffalo bill<BRK>the bill need to give josh allen someone to throw to  first of all  they also have a top   pick in each round of the draft and a boatload of cap space  around    million  to give brown the guaranteed money he want  <BRK>   arizona cardinal<BRK>giving kliff kingsbury the opportunity to throw the ball in brown s direction   time a game would make the cardinal infinitely more watchable  no matter who the quarterback is <BRK>   denver bronco<BRK>the bronco won t be loaded with cap room after the deal for joe flacco go through  but they can get    million in saving by cutting case keenum  getting a veteran receiver while emmanuel sander recovers from a torn achilles is a scenario that make enough sense that nfl network s ian rapoport reported trading for brown is an avenue the team is likely to pursue  <BRK>   detroit lion<BRK>the lion suffered through one of the worst season of matthew stafford s career thanks to a depleted wr depth chart  adding brown through some combination of valuable draft pick and or young player could be the litmus test that determines whether he s capable of recovery  <BRK>   houston texan<BRK>houston ha three of the draft s first   pick and around    million in cap space this spring  figuring out what to do with jadeveon clowney and tyrann mathieu will eat into that  but fitting brown into the space demaryius thomas left behind when he wa released would give deshaun watson one of the league s most explosive receiving corp <BRK>   dallas cowboy<BRK>the cowboy shipped away their   first round pick in their trade for amari cooper  now they need to figure out how to extend him and quarterback dak prescott a they head toward the final seaons of their rookie contract  plus lock down demarcus lawrence  still  it s jerry jones  so    <BRK>   green bay packer<BRK>the packer  wr lineup wa limited to davante adam and a pair of late round rookie last fall  and making aaron rodgers happy is one  two  and three on new head coach matt lafleur s daily to do list in green bay  <BRK>   los angeles charger<BRK>los angeles could use another impact receiver to buttress keenan allen  and brown could be the tipping point that push philip river to his first super bowl appearance  <BRK>   seattle seahawks<BRK>russell wilson seems to get by with doug baldwin and an assortment of guy who never get selected in your fantasy draft  let s see what he could do with another top wideout <BRK>   tennessee titan<BRK>the titan need receiving help alongside a budding corey davis  but they only have six pick in the upcoming draft  all in the later part of each round  they also have an unsettled quarterback situation thanks to marcus mariota s continuous string of injury  <BRK>   tampa bay buccaneer<BRK>the buccaneer have better draft capital but le cap space for an extension  take what we just said about mariota and replace the last four word with  consistently terrible decision making   and now it applies to jameis winston <BRK>   new york giant<BRK>the giant have their own wide receiver rumor to handle  they need to figure out if they re really committed to odell beckham jr  before they start throwing the asset they ll need to rebuild at brown  <BRK>   chicago bear<BRK>the bear don t have a great deal of cap space and they don t have the pick to make a big offer after trading away two first rounder for khalil mack  still  the idea of brown  allen robinson  taylor gabriel  and anthony miller is exciting <BRK>   minnesota viking<BRK>imagine antonio brown  adam thielen  and stefon diggs on the same team  that trio would possibly be the best group of receiver in nfl history  it s fun to dream about  but the viking can t realistically make a trade for brown  they don t have much cap space to navigate free agency  <BRK>   los angeles ram<BRK>the ram were wildly aggressive during the   offseason  acquiring ndamukong suh  aqib talib  marcus peter  and brandin cook for a super bowl run  it worked  but now the ram have only one selection in the top   pick of the   nfl draft and not enough cap space to keep all their impending free agent  <BRK>   kansa city chief<BRK>kansa city did one thing really well in    score point  it wa the chief  terrible defense that wa the issue all year and will be the top priority in the offseaon  so a fun a it is to imagine brown on an offense with patrick mahomes  tyreek hill  and travis kelce  there s no way the chief use up the cap space that they have to add another offensive weapon <BRK>   atlanta falcon<BRK>atlanta ha julio jones and calvin ridley  wide receiver is the last thing the falcon need to worry about  <BRK>   jacksonville jaguar<BRK>jacksonville will have a little more cap flexibility once it release more player  but the team need to focus on using that money to pay up for a quarterback before making a trade for a receiver a priority <BRK>   philadelphia eagle<BRK>the eagle will get their cap reprieve when nick foles make his inevitable departure  but that ll just take the team out of the negative and into the green  philly would need some serious maneuvering to somehow make enough space for brown  if the eagle did manage to create that space  the team could improve it receiving corp just by making sure golden tate is around for another year <BRK>   washington<BRK>the four year     million contract alex smith signed lat seaon didn t leave wahington much room to do much this offseaon  the even bigger problem  smith s gruesome leg injury ha left the team without a starting quarterback in    after the team is done worrying about that problem  it won t have much left over to go after a player a pricy a brown <BRK>   new orleans saint<BRK>the saint badly need someone to take the pressure off michael thomas  capable shoulder  but they have almost no cap space  they also still need to keep their pocket relatively clear so they can give extension to thomas  alvin kamara  and marshon lattimore <BRK>   miami dolphin<BRK>miami s richest football tradition is a cap sheet that s a complete mess  and the franchise may have to be razed down to it foundation before being rebuilt under new head coach brian flores <BRK>   carolina panther<BRK>the panther just suffered through a down season on their  playoff every other year  plan  brown could be a key piece of their latest revival while giving cam newton his first true wr  since steve smith  though money is tight  <BRK>   new england patriot<BRK>the patriot could lose three of their top four wide receiver to free agency this spring  and bill belichick ha been aggressive at the position in the past with high profile acquisition like randy moss and chad ochocinco  the team traded for josh gordon this season and reportedly made a run at odell beckham jr  last year  but do the steelers want to deal an elite talent to a team that rule the afc  nope <BRK>   cleveland brown<BRK>the brown have the cap space and asset to make a run at brown  but combining a vindictive former steeler with baker mayfield  whose default mode is  vindictive  to begin with  would make the pair a borderline superhero duo at heinz field <BRK>   baltimore raven<BRK>the raven need wideouts badly  but the steelers f ing hate them  <BRK>   cincinnati bengal<BRK>same for the bengal  but even more <BRK>
