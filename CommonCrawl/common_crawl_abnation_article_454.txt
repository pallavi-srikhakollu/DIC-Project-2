by sb nation nfl  <BRK> sometime it s good to step back and reset  when assessing team need for the   offseason  we decided to do something to that effect   instead of carrying forward the running list of need that everybody u for every team at all time  we elected to see if the stats were telling u anything different  <BRK> below are the primary need for all   team if we had  without any knowledge of their roster  simply looked at their   advanced stats and assessed their major weakness  some team are going to have  need  for position they re obviously hoping they can address with someone already on the roster   buffalo needing a quarterback  for instance  but it felt like a good time to start clean and simply say   if team a is going to improve in    here are the aspect of their game they need to address   whether that s through free agency  the draft  or in house development  <BRK> the bill used free agency to build around josh allen  getting quantity  if not quality  a they work to prop up their budding franchise qb  wideouts john brown and cole bealey will add viable target for a weak pasing game  and linemen mitch morse and spencer long should keep allen from getting his jersey too dirty in    <BRK> there are still plenty of hole to fill in buffalo  however  the bill lack the kind of game changing wr  who can give bealey  brown  and zay jones room to thrive  they could also use a run stopping plug in the middle of the defensive line now that kyle williams ha retired  and the secondary need help a well  <BRK> miami need help just about everywhere  and while signing ryan fitzpatrick give the dolphin some experience at quarterback  he s no long term solution  first year head coach brian flores also brought former patriot eric rowe and dwayne allen south with him  which   yeah  isn t splashy  <BRK> that leaf plenty of work to do in the draft and   will be a rebuilding year  so flores should prioritize adding a much pure talent to a barren roster a possible  replenishing the team s defense   primarily at edge rusher and in the secondary   and the offensive line would be a good start for what could be a long road back to prosperity  <BRK> the patriot watched some premium talent leave this offseason when trent brown and trey flower each struck off for massive contract elsewhere and rob gronkowski retired  filling tom brady s need for receiving talent is the uninspiring new group of demaryius thomas  bruce ellington  matt lacosse  maurice harris  and austin seferian jenkins  on the plus side  veteran michael bennett and mike pennel should be able to replace some of the versatile upfront presence flower left behind  <BRK> new england still need young blood at wideout and tight end  a well a a dominant pas rusher to keep player like deatrich wise and john simon in rotational role  with   pick  the patriot could also grab an offensive tackle and   gap    a quarterback to potentially replace brady one day  if he ever stop playing football   <BRK> new york is following a similar blueprint a buffalo  adding talent around a second year quarterback to help coax a giant leap out  that s brought le veon bell and jamison crowder into town to revamp the offense  while c j  mosley will be called upon to lead the jet  defense  <BRK> the team still need to address the departure along the interior of it offensive line in order to allow bell to feast and to keep sam darnold upright  new york also need help at cornerback to allow the jamal adam marcus maye duo to shine and an edge presence to balance out an uneven pas rush  <BRK> the raven lost some big name  c j  mosley  joe flacco  terrell suggs  and added a pair of their own in earl thoma and mark ingram  that ll add an extra punch to the running game and provide a younger upgrade to eric weddle at safety  but baltimore s chance to repeat a afc north champion may hinge on adding new  dynamic talent in this year s draft  <BRK> the top priority may be giving lamar jackson the receiving  and tight end  talent he need to thrive a a paser  he could use more help in the middle of his offensive line to clear a path for both him and ingram on the ground  too  the raven also need pas rusher to replace the production suggs and za darius smith left behind  <BRK> the bengal  quest to move on from the marvin lewis era meant re signing marginal  or oft injured  talent like bobby hart  c j  uzomah  and tyler eifert  vontaze burfict is gone though  so now the steelers will have to drive   more yard than usual each time they play cincinnati  <BRK> new coach zac taylor is an offensive minded leader  but he ll have to draft a cache of defensive talent to restore the bengal to contender status  cincinnati need help in the trench  with gap at both defensive tackle and along the edge  and linebacker support   especially now that burfict is gone  a quarterback to eventually take over for andy dalton could be on the agenda  too  <BRK> only the raider could match the brown  big name activity this offseaon  a new head coach freddie kitchen added odell beckham jr   olivier vernon  kareem hunt  and sheldon richardson to his rising team  this influx of talent  coupled with the strong finish to    ha cleveland looking like afc north favorite for the first time in a long  long time  <BRK> there are still hole to be patched  though none especially gaping  a foundational left tackle could upgrade baker mayfield s protection in   and beyond  a linebacker who can be the kirkland version of jamie collins and another cornerback would boost the defense  oh  and a punter would help  too  <BRK> le veon bell  gone  antonio brown  gone  jesse james  also gone  but in much le dramatic fashion  <BRK> who s in  mark barron  steven nelson and  uh  donte moncrief  <BRK> so the steelers need some fresh talent in this year s draft  getting an inside linebacker who can cover rangy tight end and replace the leadership ryan shazier once provided would be a big win  help at cornerback should artie burn never live up to his potential is also needed  and ben roethlisberger could use some supporting wr te help to keep pittsburgh s offensive legacy intact  <BRK> the texan lost two major component of their   run when starting safety tyrann mathieu and kareem jackson departed for eight figure salary elsewhere  kevin johnson and christian covington followed  leaving gap only be partially filled by free agent signees tashaun gipson  bradley roby  and briean boddy calhoun  <BRK> houston still need secondary help  especially if roby remains a bit of an enigma  but most importantly it need to keep deshaun watson   who wa sacked an unacceptable   time in     upright and healthy  upgrading an ever porous offensive line will be paramount to the team s afc south title defense  <BRK> the colt jumpstarted their rebuild with a handful of impact addition last offseason  but have been relatively quiet this spring despite a wealth of cap space  indianapolis re signed pierre desir  bet on devin funchess living up to his potential with andrew luck  and then lured justin houston north after he wa released by the chief to cap a small   but potent   free agent haul  <BRK> chris ballard absolutely nailed last year s draft  adding two different all pro  this year he need some wide receiving help behind t y  hilton and funchess  a pas rusher to thrive next to veteran houston and jabaal sheard  and some secondary help to keep desir from shouldering the entire load in the defensive backfield  he ll have four top   pick to get there  <BRK>   wa an impressive mess  and the   offseason brought quarterback nick foles and not much else to help it  jacksonville is betting last year s defensive regression won t last  adding only green bay linebacker jake ryan despite losing tashaun gipson and malik jackson  it still ha several good  young player in place  but it would benefit from finding an edge rusher to pair with yannick ngakoue  <BRK> the jaguar  lack of cap space place an extra emphasis on drafting playmaker   particularly wide receiver and tight end who can expand foles  margin of error  on a similar note  help at either tackle position would help keep foles protected  he wa sacked     percent the past two year in philadelphia  while blake bortles and cody kessler were sacked on   percent of their dropbacks in    <BRK> tennessee ha to make a decision about whether to commit to marcus mariota at quarterback or not a he enters the final year of his rookie contract  the team ha given him some extra weapon this offseaon  signing slot receiver adam humphries and lineman rodger saffold  the latter will be particularly useful after losing both his starting guard from     josh kline and quinton spain   this spring  <BRK> adding more playmaker would help mariota be his best self  but a few impact defender could transform the titan  defense from good to great  tennessee need additional depth at all three level of the defense  including pas rushing presence both inside and out and some safety help alongside kevin byard  fortunately  the   nfl draft is loaded with those type of player  <BRK> john elway ha pegged joe flacco  a man with worse number than cae keenum in    a his keenum replacement  and though he added ja wuan james to hold down the right tackle spot  he also lost interior blocker matt paradis and billy turner in free agency  creating a need to protect the former super bowl mvp   or whichever rookie take over  <BRK> yep  quarterback is a major need elway will have to address at the   nfl draft  so is tight end  where jake butt ha been limited to just three game in two season due to injury  the denver defense could also use an infusion of talent after backsliding in    most notably  the bronco could use a powerful defensive tackle who can take the blocking attention away from von miller and bradley chubb along the edge  <BRK> the chief needed defense  but were too cash strapped to keep the big name they already had in    eric berry  dee ford  steven nelson  and justin houston are all gone from last year s afc finalist squad  tyrann mathieu and alex okafor will help bolster the defensive rebuild  but they ll need help  <BRK> kansa city enters the draft with several need and some unappealing pick with which to fill them  the club need pas rusher who can provide the exterior pressure to allow chris jones to feast  it need secondary help to keep team from outscoring patrick mahomes  and  if the value is there  the chief wouldn t be too off base by picking up some interior line help to keep mahomes upright  <BRK> the charger    put them back in contention for the afc west crown  but a tight salary cap situation meant the biggest contract they d hand out would go to backup quarterback tyrod taylor  los angeles  free agent loss were minimal   deep threat tyrell williams  lane clogging dt darius philon  and oft injured cornerback jason verrett foremost among them   so there s a chance philip river  team can compete in   even without a new crop of rookie playmaker  <BRK> of course  an impact draft class could be the missing piece that sends river to his first super bowl  la need receiving talent to replace williams and give keenan allen some downfield support   especially if allen get injured again  the team could also use some help along the edge to keep it veteran quarterback protected  <BRK> jon gruden s second offseaon wa somehow busier than his first  a he handed out masive deal to trent brown  tyrell williams  and lamarcus joyner after trading for unhappy pittsburgh wideout antonio brown  vontaze burfict is also here to give john madden flahbacks of his  s oakland squad  <BRK> the raider are primed for a bounce back  but they ve still got need to address if they re going to compete in the ultra tough afc west  they no longer have a khalil mack like presence in the pas rush and could use help both on the edge and from the interior of their defensive line  they also need secondary help   a need that s haunted the team for what seems like the past decade   and a useful dual threat tailback to replace marshawn lynch   whenever  <BRK> the cowboy ued this offseason to keep demarcu lawrence locked down and bring jason witten out of retirement  which is a boon for both their receiving corp and any of u who failed to mute monday night football in    signing randall cobb add an extra weapon for dak prescott  who will be without cole beasley and geoff swaim after both signed elsewhere  and while george iloka isn t earl thomas  he ll still add value to the dallas secondary  <BRK> but prescott still need target  particularly at tight end with witten pushing   year old  and that defense could use a long term solution at safety  especially since iloka is only signed for a single year  getting lawrence a pocket crumpling running mate would be a boost a well  <BRK> dave gettleman s reshaping of the giant  roster ha been puzzling for much of the   offseason  he traded both odell beckham jr  and olivier vernon to the brown  leaving big shoe to fill at wide receiver and defensive end   although the latter trade landed guard kevin zeitler in new york  helping to upgrade an offensive line that struggled in    the giant also lost landon collins  one of the best young safety in the nfl  in free agency  <BRK> the giant found replacement by signing receiver golden tate  pas rusher markus golden  and safety antoine bethea  but all three are downgrade  and the team still ha work to do at the most premium position   not to mention quarterback  where a replacement for eli manning need to be found soon  <BRK> the eagle already have a roster that should continue to be in super bowl contention  so the offseason ha mostly just been small tinkering to make it even better  the eagle added malik jackson to the defensive line  traded to bring receiver desean jackson back to where his career began  and added running back jordan howard in another trade  <BRK> there are no hole on the roster that desperately need to be filled  but philadelphia could stand to add defensive depth  michael bennett wa traded away to the patriot  leaving room for another pas rusher to be added to the mix  more help in the secondary and a replacement for   year old left tackle jason peter could also be top priority  <BRK> the offseason started for washington in a big way with the addition of landon collins  a transformative safety who should make a gigantic difference on defense  the problem is the rest of the spring ha just been depressing for the team  <BRK> alex smith probably won t be back in    and wahington acquired cae keenum a the quarterback to temporarily fill those shoe  the team also signed colossal draft bust ereck flower for offensive line depth  and pulled cornerback dominique rodgers cromartie out of his brief retirement  <BRK> washington is left with plenty of rebuilding to do  a quarterback of the future need to be found at some point  but a pas rusher to complement ryan kerrigan may be the even higher priority  the team also need receiver  defensive back  and offensive linemen  <BRK> lat year  the bear dove headfirst into free agency and then landed khalil mack in a trade just before the regular seaon  the   offseaon han t been nearly a exciting  but it han t had to be  chicago is already a contender and tried nudging itself over the hump by signing safety ha ha clinton dix and receiver cordarrelle patterson  <BRK> clinton dix will help offset the loss of adrian amos  who joined the packer in free agency  the bear also lost cornerback bryce callahan and running back jordan howard  but the addition of buster skrine and mike davis should fill those hole  <BRK> all that leaf little work left for general manager ryan pace to do in the draft  the bear could target help in the secondary  another pas rusher  or hunt for some skill position upgrade  <BRK> the coup of the offseason for the lion wa pas rusher trey flower  who will make a big difference on defense if he provides more consistency than ezekiel ansah did  that wa far from the only move detroit made  though  the lion also brought on cornerback justin coleman and rashaan melvin  tight end jesse james  and receiver danny amendola  <BRK> still  the roster ha plenty of reconstruction left to do  matthew stafford need more help  and detroit could benefit from drafting another receiver and one of the many top tight end prospect this year  most of all  matt patricia could use more piece on defense   especially in the secondary and on a defensive line that need to add more than just flower  <BRK> it wa an uncharacteristically active venture into free agency for the packer  who added safety adrian amos  linebacker za darius smith and preston smith  and offensive lineman billy turner  all those addition free up green bay to use the draft to fulfill it top priority of the offseason  make aaron rodgers happy  <BRK> outside of davante adam  there really aren t many receiving option that the packer can feel comfortable with on the roster  both receiver and tight end could be on the draft day wish list for green bay  the packer could also stand to round out the defense with linemen and defensive back to complement their free agent addition  <BRK> the viking  defense wa still good in    but quarterback kirk cousin wan t the savior who pushed the team over the top  part of his struggled can be attributed to an offensive line that failed to clear space  minnesota hasn t done much to fix that yet  though  it lost nick easton in free agency released mike remmers  and only spent big money to retain anthony barr  <BRK> protecting cousin is clearly the top priority heading into the draft  at both guard and tackle  other place on the roster   like running back  wide receiver  and defensive tackle   could stand to add depth a well  <BRK> the offseaon for the falcon ha consisted of more subtraction than addition with tevin coleman  robert alford  andy levitre  and bruce irvin all leaving a free agent  atlanta kept the most important impending free agent  though  by giving defensive tackle grady jarrett the franchise tag  <BRK> still  matt ryan ha no shortage of weapon  and the defense ha speed at linebacker and in the secondary  now  atlanta need to add beef on both side of the ball  <BRK> the defensive line will be the more important project of the two with defensive tackle and pa rusher at the top of the wish list  the offensive line need help too  but adding james carpenter and jamon brown in free agency may serve a a solid band aid for the situation  <BRK> it s starting to feel like a bit of a broken record at this point  the panther need to upgrade cam newton s supporting cast  keeping offensive tackle daryl williams and signing center matt paradis wa a start  but the offensive line could still use more help and receiving option are thin after d j  moore and curtis samuel   especially after the departure of devin funchess  <BRK> but the bigger issue is a defensive line that ha kawann short  mario addison  and not much else  julius pepper finally retired and that leaf pa rusher a the clear top priority for the team heading into the draft  <BRK> the saint didn t need to do much this offseason after a   win season  and that s good because they didn t have many resource to use  new orleans need cap space in the reserve to lock down michael thomas and alvin kamara for the future  but the team still managed to tinker away in free agency and add tight end jared cook and center nick easton  it lost pas rusher alex okafor and running back mark ingram  but replaced the latter with latavius murray  <BRK> new orleans isn t scheduled to make it first draft pick until late in the second round  but there s no single pressing need that the saint have to address  adding a defensive tackle  wide receiver  or cornerback who can contribute a a rookie could be all it take to push the saint over the top  <BRK> bruce arians  first year coaching in tampa look like a rebuilding one  the bucs made few big move this offseason  their most expensive signing of the spring wa punter bradley pinion  kwon alexander  adam humphries  and even ryan fitzpatrick have all moved on from tampa bay  leaving arians with an opportunity to shape the team in his image  <BRK> alexander s departure leaf a hole in the middle of the defense  and the receiving corp are pretty limited after mike evans thanks to humphries  departure and the trade that shipped desean jackson back to philadelphia  some high upside defensive back would also help bolster one of the league s worst passing defense   and allow quarterback jameis winston to win some game that aren t shootout  <BRK> while the cardinal made some minor move to improve an awful roster this offseason  their rebound from   s bottoming out will come through the draft  defender like jordan hick  darius philon  and robert alford were strong supporting addition  but player like j r  sweezy  charles clay  and a   year old terrell suggs probably aren t going to be instrumental to the team s rebuild  <BRK> kyler murray would  however  taking a second straight first round quarterback would give debuting head coach kliff kingsbury a passer he s long coveted and make arizona infinitely more entertaining  the cardinal need plenty of help elsewhere  no matter who their   qb is   restocking the team s offensive line and receiving corp should be a priority during the draft  <BRK>   ha been a measured offseason for a ram team that built an nfc champion over the course of the previous two year  starter like lamarcus joyner  rodger saffold  and mark barron have departed  replaced by eric weddle  clay matthew  and whomever can step up either in this year s draft or from previous draft  <BRK> the reigning nfc west champ aren t hurting for talent  but an aging secondary could use reinforcement   many of which will be available at the end of the first round  there s need up front  too  especially since it appears ndamukong suh won t be returning to los angeles this fall  <BRK> san francisco lost a season due to quarterback jimmy garoppolo s knee injury  but   should bring improvement thanks to the expensive addition of linebacker kwon alexander and pas rusher dee ford  and the low risk  high reward signing of tevin coleman  jordan matthew  and jason verrett  the free agent loss were minimal  too   the biggest name leaving santa clara were punter bradley pinion and rotational pas rusher cassius marsh  <BRK> the niner have premier position in this year s draft  which should allow them to pick up the pas rushing talent they need with the no    selection  their second round spot will yield a solid group of young receiver to team up with marquise goodwin  george kittle  and dante pettis and push garoppolo to a resurgent season  a little extra blocking wouldn t hurt  either  <BRK> seattle s latest attempt to protect russell wilson swap out j r  sweezy for mike iupati  which is a step in the right direction but probably not enough for wilson to avoid being one of the league s most sacked qbs again  while retaining k j  wright and the awaiting sentence for insider trading mychal kendricks help  that won t offset the loss of defender like shamar stephen  justin coleman  and especially earl thomas  <BRK> if the seahawks want to stave off a decline  they ll have to add some defensive talent both up front and in the backfield to provide at least a passable imitation of the former legion of boom  wilson still need help too   not just from a cheesecloth offensive line  but also from a group of wide receiver and tight end target led by tyler lockett and a   year old doug baldwin  <BRK>     vox medium  inc  all right reserved <BRK>
