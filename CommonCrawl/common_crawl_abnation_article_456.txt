at the end of each conference preview run through  i take a look at how i perceive the conference s balance of power heading into the season  this is in no way based on schedule  so they are not prediction  this is just how i would rank the team after writing thousand of word about each of them  <BRK> here s a link to every team s data  and each team s name below is linked to it preview  <BRK>    wmu   toledo   ohio   niu   emu <BRK> when i can t decide on an order  i get a little bit excited  each of these five team ha quite a bit going for it   and in the case of emu  more than it ha had since the  s   but there are definitive flaw for each  on both side of the ball for most of them  <BRK> wmu ha load of experience  but a lot come from a defense that wa really bad  toledo s got a remodeled defensive line and a new receiving corp  ohio ha a green receiving corp and a lot of impressive talent to replace in the trench  niu ha to replace the one guy it might not be capable of replacing on defense and han t been good offensively for a couple of year  emu s rebuilding in the trench and doesn t quite have the skill corp depth  <BRK> but they re all in it  and hell  the next two team are basically a quarterback away from being in it  too  <BRK>    buffalo   miami  ohio  <BRK> if either team strike gold in their search for a new starting qb  they could easily end up making a conference title run  they re not very far from the pack up top  <BRK>    ball state   kent state   cmu <BRK> the goal for tier   is bowl eligibility  plain and simple  one of the three will probably make it  two if either miami or buffalo bomb at qb  <BRK>    akron   bowling green <BRK>  sbn_billc   godfrey is the bowling green coaching staff the closest we ll ever get to the neccessary roughness coaching staff   askpapn <BRK> here s how my statistical system ha the mac laid out for    with zero equating to an average fbs team   you can find full   s p  projection here   <BRK> quite a bit of potential shift here  <BRK> ohio and toledo easily led the way in overall quality  and niu somehow won the conference despite basically being a mid tier team   <BRK> this year  the husky and wmu   who looked strong before losing quarterback jon wassink to injury  and now get him back    have le to replace than last year s top squad  <BRK> also noteworthy  there are seven team projected within a touchdown of the top team  compare that to the acc  no one within   point of clemson   big    no one within   point of oklahoma   or even g  conference like the mwc  two team within seven point  or aac  three   this is going to be a delightful race to follow  <BRK> projected conference win  with overall win in parenthesis  <BRK> the rocket are projected a the third best team in the division but get by far the best schedule  welcoming wmu  niu  and emu to toledo and missing the eat s top two team  <BRK> four team project within one conference win of each other in the west  and the eat is nearly a tight  with three team within     game  and hell  kent state s only one upset from muddying thing up even further  <BRK> hot damn  cmu s offense wa bad last year  almost anything jim mcelwain try will improve the chippewa  offense  simply via progression to the mean  <BRK> sutton smith led an intense  efficient niu defense  we ll see what the husky can do without smith and with a new coaching staff  <BRK> rourke combined     passing yard with     non sack rushing yard  even in an era of gaudy qb stats  that s worth celebrating  <BRK> i might go with danna here if the odds weren t good that he d be a michigan wolverine come fall  so instead  we ll go with the guy who might finally be ready for huge attention after serving a smith s second fiddle at niu  baically every picture of antonio jones davis in our photo tool ha him going horizontal like a fired missile  he s fun  <BRK> mac fan  <BRK>
