the antonio brown saga is one of the nfl s biggest offseason storyline so far  <BRK>the latest on the steelers wide receiver   who ha been trying to force his way out of western pennsylvania   is that the team is willing to trade him  pittsburgh general manager kevin colbert recently said brown and the steelers have now agreed that a trade is best for both side moving forward  though the team won t move on from him at a discount  <BRK>so  where will brown end up  according to some nfl executive  the philadelphia eagle are considered a a potential landing spot for one of the league s most talented pas catcher  via espn in ider <BRK>the most logical suitor for brown  exec agreed that new england would be the ideal suitor  but none thought the steeler would send brown to a primary afc rival unless the compensation wa unrealistically high  the san francisco  er  green bay packer  los angeles ram and philadelphia eagle were four interesting nfc destination exec mentioned  the oakland raider and denver bronco were two afc team exec thought made sense  the seattle seahawks and kansa city chief were a couple of potentially opportunistic team an exec thought were worth mentioning <BRK>and here s the reasoning that espn cited <BRK>eagle  they ve been leader in the trade market over the year and were active in the market for receiver during the season  acquiring golden tate <BRK>well  that seems like a pretty flimsy premise  <BRK>i don t see the eagle trading for brown  who turn   in july  <BRK>the biggest obstacle is brown s contract  his   base salary is      million and he s currently set to carry a whopping      million cap figure this season  the eagle  meanwhile  have the lowest amount of cap space in the league  philly will be able to free up room  yes  but are they really going to want to use a lot of it on a disgruntled  aging wide receiver  i don t think so <BRK>the steelers  meanwhile  shouldn t be in a rush to trade brown  by dealing him before june    pittsburgh will only save    million in cap space compared to      million in dead money  by waiting until after june    the steelers can save      million compared to    million in dead money  <BRK>the eagle can t just wait until june to address their wide receiver position  they re going to have more realistic opportunity to improve that spot before then  they can t just bank on brown being available at a later time <BRK>and so  despite what some nfl exec might think  it s not likely brown will be headed across the keystone state to play in philly next season  for what it s worth  gambling outlet betdsi give   nfl team better odds than the eagle to land brown <BRK>this poll is closed <BRK>
