we here at sb nation realize that  the bachelor  is very much sport  therefore  each week we ll recap all the heartbreak  drama  and excitement  <BRK> we are underway and rolling at the bachelor mansion a our fresh faced colton embarks on his journey for forever love  lat week  we met the lady that would be vying for his heart and said goodbye to seven suitor  this week  we get our first date of the seaon a colton set up two group date and a one on one   <BRK> on the first group date  eight lady   demi  bri  tracy  elyse  hannah g   onyeka  dj agro  and nicole   went to a local theater  where they were greeted by  park and recreation  alum nick offerman  ron swanson  and his real life wife megan mullally  tammy swanson   colton and the lady took the stage to read story of memorable first in their life  then went to the mandated cocktail party portion of the date  elyse snagged the group date rose  keeping her safe for another week   <BRK> demi caused more problem out the gate  but i respect that she give literally no shit whether or not people like her   <BRK> hannah b   aka miss alabama  got the first one on one  which coincided with her birthday  she salvaged the disaster of a date in the evening portion  getting a rose and guaranteeing we see some model beef in the future  some other stuff happened  but i got bored and got distracted by a little bit of duke syracuse basketball   <BRK> on the second group date  colton got some help from comedian and fellow  park and rec  actor billy eichner a the lady competed in camp game for a chance to participate in an overnight sleep away at camp bachelor   <BRK> in an objectively hilarious moment  eichner tell colton he s gay   i know  that s a shock    and tell our bachelor that maybe he should look into that a he wag his finger at him   <BRK> the lady were split into two team and competed in a relay race  a canoe race  and a bout of tug o war to see who got to stick around under the star with colton  alex  katie  cassie  the goat   heather  who got the date rose   caelynn  and tayshia stuck around for some colton chatting while sitting around fire under big fluffy blanket    <BRK> and now  all of my superlative highlight from the episode   <BRK> i mean  this is a real choice   <BRK> hannah b   miss alabama  got the first one on one  and i gotta be honest  friend  it didn t go great  it wa her birthday  and right out of the gate she talked about how her need to be perfect chip away at her confidence  they tried to do a harmless toast  and colton went first  she struggled to find any word  finally settling on a  here s to my birthday  roll tide  toast   <BRK> caelynn  miss north carolina  shared that she and hannah b  were roommate at miss usa  where the two were close until caelynn wa named first runner up  i smell some drama coming between the two   and soon   <BRK> she ended up righting the ship during the night portion after she finally relaxed a little and opened up about her own life   <BRK> look  i love ron swanson and  park and rec  is maybe my favorite comedy  don t   me   office  fan   but this wa amazing  it wa jarring at first to hear him speak in a normal  non yelling voice  but i got over that quickly  although they continued to shoehorn in all the virgin content i neither need nor want  eichner is the only one that actually made me laugh about it   <BRK> some of billy s best work   <BRK> he then proceeded to yell at the lady in his amazing screaming voice a they competed in dumb game  billy eichner is a gem  bring him back every week  <BRK> who made this decision  why do some of them have tutu  why do some of them have pleated skirt  why are those skirt different color of yellow  i don t like any of this  go team red   <BRK> i just love cassie and she s great  that s really all  this is me when cassie get  like  no screen time   <BRK> heather is the one whose listed profession is  never been kissed   so she took the alone time on the overnight camping date to tell colton that she  too  is a virgin  and ha   you guessed it   never been kissed   despite talking to someone she know is also a virgin  heather wa clearly embarrassed or anxious about the conversation  and he did an outstanding job of lessening that awkwardness   <BRK> look  i ll be the first to admit that i thought this seaon wa going to be a train wreck because the colton we ve been able to see so far in other seaon showed him with the personality of a loaf of white bread  maybe my standard were set too low  but i think he ha been charming  nice  and kind of funny  i   kind of like him a the bachelor   <BRK> she s on a roll  last week onyeka used the whistle and snorkel to save colton from  drowning in bitch   this week she interrupted sydney s time by showing up with an airhorn and telling colton he wa  horny    <BRK> we re getting close to adding a section called  onyeka s worst interruption of the week  if she s not careful   <BRK> there are no winner here and the audience is the big loser  demi is childish and condescending while pretending to be friend with everyone  tracy think she s more important because she s older than most of the woman and clearly doesn t understand how this show work   <BRK> while demi s interruption wa annoying and taking colton to her  fantasy closet  for a massage and a glass of chardonnay wa cringey at best  that s the show   <BRK> here s how the whole thing went down   <BRK> ok  the last one wa a little exaggerated  but it s been two episode and i ve had it up to here  make hand gesture  with her ageism  listen  sweetheart  one day   sooner than you d like  demi   you ll be one of those late   somethings and you ll want to punch your smug   year old self right in the face   <BRK> to the detriment of my sanity  both suitor moved on to next week  oh  yay   <BRK>  there s no advantage to being an older woman here    <BRK>
