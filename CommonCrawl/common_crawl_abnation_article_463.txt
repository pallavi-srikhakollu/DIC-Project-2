we here at sb nation realize that  the bachelor  is very much sport  therefore  each week we ll recap all the heartbreak  drama  and excitement  <BRK> we open this week s episode with vlogger colton going full  blair witch project  a he talk about his uneainess around the parting warning from katie  sydney  and demi in lat week s episode   <BRK> it s understandable to second guess yourself in this situation  so i get why he s nervous  one lady say it   it s just sour grape  three  ehhhh  maybe you get a little worried   <BRK> colton sits down with former bachelor ben higgins  which reminds me that he is super adorable  sweet  and still single  hey ben  call me    <BRK> colton s starting to feel the pinch of developing feeling for several woman  saying   falling in love with multiple people scare the shit out of me   seems like a reasonable sentiment  tbh   <BRK> he meet the lady in a park in denver with his sweet dog  sniper  and tell the lady that there s a rose on each date and that the date start   right away  colton grab tayshia for a date  and she s immediately ready to spill the tea   <BRK> tayshia throw sweet  beautiful cassie and her bff caelynn under the bus with the quickness  and the panic is evident on colton s face   <BRK> this come right after a cut to cassie and caelynn talking about how crazy all this is and how they feel like they re safe because they don t really hang with sydney or tayshia  so what possible dirt could she have  <BRK> awwwwwwkward   <BRK> trying to get to the bottom of thing  colton invite caelynn on the next one on one date  they go snowboarding and then have dinner in a very rustic looking cabin  after chatting about what tayshia said  colton decides he s convinced caelynn s there for the right reason and give her the rose after telling her that he s also falling in love with her   <BRK> hannah b  got the last one on one date  leaving kirpa  cassie  heather  and hannah g  for the group date  colton took hannah home to meet his family  which is a hell of a lot of pressure just to spring on someone   <BRK> colton s dad give him some good advice  but he s clearly second guessing his relationship with hannah b  it s hard to watch a she s talking about ring and hometown date in her confessional knowing that she s about to walk into a buzzsaw   <BRK> the group date lady are clearly stoked to be hanging out   <BRK> right out of the gate  heather up and say she s not feelin  it and that she can t take him home for hometown  part of me think this is a bit of a  you can t dump me if i dump you first  situation  but i think we all knew she wasn t winning this thing   <BRK> colton pull cassie aside to talk about all the tayshia spilled tea  and cassie denies the rumor  kirpa spend her time reiterating what tayshia said and acting like her sole role there is to make sure he end up with the right woman  but i cannot for the life of me remember any time in which colton and kirpa have looked remotely like a couple   <BRK> it come out that katie is the source of all this information  and none of the other woman actually heard anything and they re just repeating bullshit they heard about cassie and caelynn  kirpa doesn t like taking the brunt of the heat from cassie and offer up an alternate method of airing her grievance   <BRK> kirpa  if you have a problem with it  call katie  <BRK> cassie   super sarcastic tone  oh  good idea  let me get my phone and call her   <BRK> point  cassie  rather than end this back and forth  colton say he need the night portion of the date to make his decision on which of the two remaining lady will get hometown rose   <BRK> seemingly five minute into dinner  colton give one of the rose to hannah g  and sends her back to the lady  house  after getting an update from hannah a to how the evening wa unfolding  caelynn drop in on the dinner to go to bat for her girl casie  it work a colton keep our sweet girl around for another week   <BRK> next week  colton will visit the hometown of caelynn  hannah g   cassie  and tayshia   <BRK> here are the highlight of the week   <BRK> hi  sniper  you are a very good and sweet doggo please be my best friend   <BRK> there wa a small part of me that hoped sniper would ignore one of the woman and he would just send them home on principle  but sniper is the bestest of boy and wa nice to everyone   <BRK> kirpa han t been one of the people in the forefront this seaon a the most her name ha been said wa when the internet wa trying to figure out how she cut her chin  well  now there s another thing to add to the list  these bomb as glases   <BRK> then there s sweet  beautiful cassie  it s remarkably unfair to be so adorable and also be able to pull these off   <BRK> i ve skied twice in my life  it wa super fun  i enjoyed it  i also fell a ton and looked like a complete fool  especially when i fell getting off the ski lift and a child laughed at me   i can t imagine having to learn to snowboard with camera everywhere  good for caelynn   <BRK> it wa a short montage  but colton later say that she did a great job and he wa really proud of her   <BRK> this isn t meant to be an insult to the artist  but can we stop with the solo concert  country singer brett young serenade the duo in an empty red rock amphitheater  which is inarguably a cool setting   <BRK> i just feel so uncomfortable for everyone else  like the poor band is just awkwardly hanging out while they make out in front of you   at leat there wan t a random crowd of people filming them a they make out this time    <BRK> colton and the lady have spent the lat three week or so galavanting around aia a the group visited singapore  thailand  and vietnam  this week  the group returned to the united state and man  wa colton stoked   <BRK>  in good news  we re going to denver    <BRK> now when anyone say   i ve got good news     i m going to immediately think   omg are we going to denver     <BRK> yoooooo for real  though  look how cool this is   <BRK> the only thing that could have made this le heartbreaking is if hannah b  put on a flight suit and hopped in a plane and taxied that bitch outta there   <BRK> this guy is the best  his one job is to saunter in and take the suitcase of the jilted woman  the denver colton edition of suitcase guy is great because     we haven t seen him yet  and     he really milk it   <BRK> my man take a step in frame  pause  look at the lady  and then grab the suitcase  you re a legend  suitcase guy   <BRK> i feel like at a certain point abc is just messing with me   <BRK> abc executive    ok  so i think we need to step thing up   <BRK> abc executive    well  they re going to be in the mountain   maybe they leave on the back of a grizzly bear   <BRK> abc executive    i like where your head is at  but that s a whole  nother round of paperwork and finding a saddle big enough ha always been a problem   <BRK> abc executive    what about   a very slow and old timey train with a comical whistle   <BRK> abc executive    perfect   <BRK> i had planned to retire this section when sweet demi left u last week  but then caelynn dropped this hot fire to the camera on her one on one   <BRK>  i feel like my future wa just ripped away from me because there s an insecure    year old girl running around the house  i am the only that s falling in love with colton  so f ck her  i better get a f cking rose because i will call that stupid bitch out    <BRK>
