in january  miami herald reporter armando salguero summarized the dolphin  plan for   in one all cap word <BRK> tanking  <BRK>in the two month since his tweet  the dolphin have proven him right in just about every way possible  the team isn t going to be good in    and   from the look of it   that s exactly the plan <BRK>it s not that the player will be trying to lose when they re on the field  roster spot are too difficult to get for player  and coach have too much on the line to try to avoid win  that s why the jet managed to get out to a     start in   despite an offseason that looked a whole lot like a tank job <BRK>the jet still finished that year      because they just weren t talented enough to hang in there for a whole year  and that sure look like the kind of record the front office in miami is aiming for in   <BRK>it s probably why brian flores got a fully guaranteed  five year contract with the dolphin   an unprecedented commitment for a first year head coach  the team is buckling up for a bumpy road and needed flores to know that he isn t going to get a quick boot a a consequence <BRK>flores   like any coach in the nfl   is going to do his best to get win  and in his mind  the goal is to be the best team possible <BRK> i think the term tanking  i think it s disrespectful to the game   flores said at the nfl annual meeting  via the miami herald   i really do  i don t like that term  i don t like when people use it  this game ha done a lot for me personally  i ve said this before  football really leveled the playing field for me a a person  it s really the one thing that leveled the playing field so to disrespect the game and use that term  it stir something inside of me   to put that nicely  <BRK>but there s a reason he got a five year deal  it s because there s no reason to think the dolphin aren t going to struggle in   <BRK>miami finished the   season       a remarkable record considering the team ranked no    in offense and no    in defense  <BRK>the dolphin  only pro bowler for the season wa cornerback xavien howard <BRK>with adam gase at head coach  miami actually did a pretty good job at finding big play and maximizing it offensive opportunity  but that s about where the positive stopped <BRK>that mean there already wasn t much talent on the roster even before the offseason began  since then  the dolphin have parted with quarterback ryan tannehill  running back frank gore  wide receiver danny amendola  guard josh sitton  offensive tackle ja wuan james  and defensive end cameron wake  william hayes  and andre branch <BRK>the team is also reportedly finalizing a trade that will send robert quinn to the cowboy  quinn and wake were the only two player on the team who finished   with more than three sack <BRK>miami s starting quarterback in   is expected to be ryan fitzpatrick   a   year old journeyman on his sixth different roster since    the only other passer on the roster are luke falk and jake rudock   neither of whom ha any starting experience <BRK>the dolphin have a pair of exciting running back in kenyan drake and kalen ballage  wide receiver albert wilson also looked like an explosive deep threat before a hip injury ended his season in october  but asset on the roster worth building around are few and far between  <BRK>after the first week of free agency  the dolphin have around    million in cap space  that s top   in the nfl  but le than half of what the already competitive indianapolis colt have to spare <BRK>the good news is that in    both tannehill and ndamukong suh will be off the book and the dolphin are set to have about    million in space  only the cowboy   who still have sizable extension to give to dak prescott  ezekiel elliott  and amari cooper   are currently set to have more <BRK>miami also doesn t have many draft pick to work with in    just one selection in the middle of each of the first six round and two in the seventh round  <BRK>the no    pick in the first round could be a good spot to pick a quarterback to replace tannehill  but now that it s clear the dolphin plan on losing for a while and they have fitzpatrick in place  most mock draft are projecting miami to go in a different direction <BRK>in the latest mock draft from dan kadar  the dolphin are slated to take florida state edge rusher brian burn  that could set up miami to take a quarterback next year when there will probably be a better class of passer   like alabama s tua tagovailoa or georgia s jake fromm   to pick from  <BRK>in    the dolphin will get an extra fourth round pick thanks to the tannehill trade  and if the tanking go according to plan  miami should be able to land a pick near the top of the draft order <BRK>and that s really the goal of the team right now  to strip the roster  build up resource  and follow the blueprint set by the cleveland brown <BRK>sahi brown didn t even lat two year a the brown  executive vice president before he wa fired in december    just before the end of a winless seaon  then about halfway through the   seaon  coach hue jackson wa fired too <BRK>there wa a purpose to all that losing  though  it helped stage the construction of a roster that is now one of the most exciting group in the nfl <BRK>from the top   free agent  to mock draft  to scouting report  we ve got everything you need to get through the offseason  all in one place <BRK>brown made a few shrewd move a the man in charge in cleveland   even eating a    million cap hit in a trade for brock osweiler just to releae the quarterback and get a second round pick  after brown wa fired  the team had two pick in the top four of the   nfl draft and two more early in the second round <BRK>if brown used all the pick he acquired to pick better player  he probably would ve been in cleveland longer  he made a few great selection like myles garrett and joe schobert  but he also spent pick in the first three round on corey coleman  deshone kizer  carl nassib  shon coleman  and cody kessler   none of whom even made it to a third season with the brown <BRK>john dorsey took over and used the resource at his disposal to draft baker mayfield  denzel ward  and nick chubb  he also signed jarvis landry  traded for damarious randall  and just landed odell beckham jr  in a trade <BRK>altogether  it took the brown about two and a half season of horrible football and then the result started to come  now the team enters   with optimism through the roof <BRK>following cleveland s lead ha never been a formula for nfl success  but   believe it or not   it actually look like the brown left a good blueprint for the dolphin to follow  ideally though  miami probably hope it doesn t have to lose   of   game in the next two season like cleveland did <BRK>the dolphin have made the playoff two time in the last   season and are on a seventh different head coach since    being a terrible football team in   won t be fun to watch  but if the final product look anything like the brown  roster  then it s worth the tank  <BRK>
