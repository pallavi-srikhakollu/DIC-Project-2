patrick marleau  left wing for the toronto maple leaf  is a very likeable and admirable guy  by all account  he s a father figure in the leaf  locker room   his career ha been extremely impressive and  were he to win a cup  he would have an outside chance at making the hockey hall of fame   let s hope he doe it <BRK>unfortunately  though  father time is undefeated  and while patrick marleau ha done a much a any athlete can to ward it off  it ha taken it toll on the   year old   he s still a decent nhl player  and might still hit   point this seaon  but his play ha clearly fallen off  if he doe fall short of    it ll be his lowest total in a full year since he wa a rookie  his on ice shot and goal number have lagged behind his teammate  and he s probably the leaf  third best lw at this point <BRK>none of this is surprising  and it wouldn t be an especially big deal  except he ha the third biggest cap hit on the team  at     m  he also ha another year left on his deal  going into a year where the leaf are in a boa constrictor squeeze from the salary cap and a year where he will be     this ha led to a lot of fan coming up with varying convoluted scheme for getting rid of his cap hit   <BRK>so let s look at them <BRK>on july  nd     a couple of month before his  th birthday  patrick marleau signed a three year deal with the toronto maple leaf   the money on the deal is front loaded  and also ha heavy signing bonus   signing bonus mean that a lot of the money in this deal is payable on july  st of each year in a lump sum  rather than a ordinary player salary every two week throughout the seaon   <BRK>after this season end  there will remain     m to be paid on the contract     m will be in a signing bonus on july  st     after which marleau will only be owed     m in real dollar for the remainder of the year a sharp contrast from his cap hit  which is of course still     m <BRK>the deal ha a full no movement clause in all three year    pause   the deal ha a full no movement clause in all three year   this mean that marleau cannot be traded to any other nhl team without his consent  nor can he be placed on waiver <BRK>here are the many idea i ve heard for how people want to dispose of that cap hit <BRK>marleau ha a complete no movement clause   this mean he ha absolute veto power over any trade   by every account he is happy to be here  he ha a young family  and he really want to win a cup  which the leaf are a decent threat to do   given that he got a full no movement clause with no exception  i would bet on him using it <BRK>say marleau were to waive to go to another contender   it isn t clear any other contender would want him at his current cap hit which to be honest is about   m in excess of his on ice value at this point because they all need to spend their money more carefully than that   the san jose shark  marleau s original team  are still genuine contender in the western conference and they re likely going to spend their money on erik karlsson  joe pavelski  and possibly joe thornton <BRK>i can t read mind  and it is possible marleau is in fact willing to be traded to just about anywhere   but that doesn t sound likely to me <BRK>we could  but it doesn t do anything for u on the cap hit <BRK>because patrick marleau signed a multi year contract after he turned    the buyout doe not affect the cap hit  it impact the actual dollar paid  which is why the senator bought out the comically dumb alexandre burrow deal to save a bit of money  but the cap hit continues on for the team that bought him out a if he had played anyway <BRK>well  first he ha to waive his no move claue   i m not sure he would  but people like the idea of marleau doing a  brook orpik   where someone else doe our dirty work by buying out the contract for u  and then we sign him back for cheap to come contend again   so could we pull that off <BRK>the thinking on this is that a team that doesn t care about a giant cap hit think arizona or ottawa could take marleau s contract and buy it out for u   the problem is that the team who don t care about cap hit becaue they never spend to the cap  uually do care about real money    the lack of real money is why they don t spend to the cap    signing bonues are not affected by buyout  they have to be paid anyway and the money cannot be reduced   you will recall that marleau ha a        cheque coming his way on july  st    <BRK>the first buy out period  not coincidentally  end on june  th   meaning any team who bought him out would be on the hook for the signing bonus   you would need a team that had both the real dollar to spend and the cap space  and while that s not impossible  the new york ranger might be in this position   they would naturally command a hefty price for the privilege   it s worth noting  also  that even relatively free spending ownership might not be keen on buying draft pick for several million dollar   that said  of all of these idea  i think the question with this is le  is it possible  and more  do we want to pay what it would cost  <BRK>no  we can t   remember <BRK>june  th  first buy out window end<BRK>july  st  signing bonus get paid<BRK>now  you might have noticed  i said first buy out period end   there is a second buy out period that can be opened up for team that have salary arbitration hearing   we re not going to worry about why  though  because you can t use the second buy out period to buy out a player who wan t on your team s reserve list a of the previous trade deadline   see section     of the cba  <BRK>so there s no way for u to both pay the signing bonu and then trade marleau in time for someone to ue the second buy out window on him  <BRK>he could  but   <BRK>if a player sign a multi year contract when he is age   or older  that deal count against the team s salary cap whether he is playing or not   see article     c  iv  of the cba   now  if he doe  his cap hit becomes just an empty one  with no money owed <BRK>pavel datsyuk left for the khl after the   season  leaving the red wing with a giant cap hit and no actual money owed   when you say  giant cap hit and no actual money  three time into a mirror  the arizona coyote appear behind you  and so it wa  the coyote took on the weightless cap hit in exchange for the opportunity to move up in the   draft and pick jakob chychrun  th overall <BRK>is patrick marleau liable to go over to the khl for a year to save u the inconvenience of his unwieldy contract   well  since he wa    the only two league he s played in are the whl and the nhl  he didn t even go to europe during the lockout  unlike some of his teammate  and again he ha a family a well a a desire to win a cup   you cannot win the stanley cup in rusia  and never will be able to unless vladimir putin successfully sabotage the american democratic process  and we all know that s crazy talk <BRK>is patrick marleau done entirely  i don t think he think he is  and again  he sure did like that third year   he s still an nhler who s playing every game  <BRK>he could nonetheless say he s had enough and call it a day   and you can hope he doe  but i think saying it s likely is letting the wish be father to the thought <BRK>i will say i actually think this one is kind of clever  sadly the nhl also thought so and they specifically made it illegal   see     e  iii  c      or honestly  just take my word for it <BRK>leaf fan are pretty familiar with long term injured reserve  or ltir  by now  since we ve used it with regard to the nathan horton contract  which wa in turn acquired a we tried to get away from the disatrous david clarkson deal   ltir is an extremely complicated thing and <BRK> lower voice <BRK>i am honest to god convinced the nhl ha changed significant detail of it a it ha gone along <BRK> clear throat <BRK>anyway  if you want to learn more about the finer point of ltir and or cure your insomnia  i recommend this faq from the good people at cap friendly   the short version is that long term injured reserve can help team whose player are seriously injured by giving them some ability to exceed the upper limit   it is not a cure all and it is not the same a free cap space  but it can be helpful <BRK>ltir is  to some fan  a bit of a joke in that they believe pretty much any team can put anyone on ltir if they want to   the most infamous cae of this wa marian hossa  who purportedly developed a serious skin condition at a convenient time for the hawk and also right a his real salary dropped    the hawk later dealt away the leftover cap hit  which wa much higher than the remaining dollar salary owing   you ll never guess which team they traded it to  <BRK>patrick marleau ha not missed an nhl game in literally ten year and famously take excellent care of himself  so for him to immediately develop a career ending ailment right when the leaf need his cap hit to go away would be  uh  a little suspicious   it s not impossible they would get away with it  but i would be astonished if the league wouldn t investigate <BRK>more seriously  we have to ak why marleau is going along with this idea   marian hossa s deal wa pretty clearly designed for him to retire out of back when it wa legal to sign player to   year back diving contract   marleau picked a three year deal over the two year one he could have gotten elsewhere  and one of the league s greatest iron men probably doe want to play   some people have noted the signing bonus and the front loaded structure of the contract a evidence that marleau wan t supposed to play year    but those thing are popular simply because money now is better than money later   marleau had signing bonus every year of his contract  not just the third one  so do auston matthew and john tavares  and their contract are front loaded too   <BRK>is this impossible   no   doe any element of it seem likely   not really <BRK>this is getting into the deep end of the swimming pool  so i won t spend too much time on it   but let u say patrick marleau fails to report to training camp  and the leaf terminate his contract for material breach becaue he didn t show up <BRK>i actually don t know if this would eliminate the cap hit   the language of     c  iv  suggests it might not   but this would presumably only happen a part of a scheme between marleau and the leaf to circumvent the salary cap  and if the league doesn t look at this they might a well fold   the relevant section are     and      but i feel like the problem should be pretty obvious <BRK>we might also wonder whether patrick marleau would prefer to make     m on a contender or to take a handshake deal going into an illegal side agreement  and this start to feel kind of silly <BRK>the thing about getting out of marleau s contract is that all of the mean by which we would do so require patrick marleau to go along with it   he control his fate   further to that  he s still an nhl player  even if an overpaid one  he seems to like where he is  he want to win the cup   doe he seem to you like he s ready to leave   <BRK>this is an open question  but i can t point to any evidence that he is   and if he isn t <BRK>unless the leaf find a buyer willing to pay him a whack of a signing bonus in a buyout and the price for that is going to be steep from toronto it s hard to see any scenario he d want to go along with   in looking at these thing  it s worth asking not just  can i see a crazy scenario where this is possible  and start thinking  do i have any evidence why this is likely    and you re going to find pretty quickly that the most likely option is simply that patrick marleau will play the final year of his deal in toronto <BRK>unless   <BRK>patrick marleau  we are sorry to say  ha disappeared   he may have been abducted by alien   it wa especially tragic a it happened right after he picked up his signing bonus <BRK>luckily  the leaf have signed a new free agent at      to shore up their left wing depth <BRK>good work everyone   problem solved <BRK>
