the patriot are damn near impossible to beat at gillette stadium  including the playoff  they ve won   straight home game dating back to october    in the postseason alone  they re on a   game winning streak in foxborough and have a     overall record in the tom brady bill belichick era  <BRK> the problem is they re not playing at home this sunday   partly thanks to gronk s inability to play safety  <BRK> the patriot travel to western missouri  where the chief finally broke the curse and won their first home playoff game since mariah carey s  hero  wa the no    song on the radio     and y know  when people still listened to this thing called the  radio   <BRK> despite a three point win over the chief earlier this season  the patriot will have to play in the decidedly unfriendly confines of arrowhead stadium  it shouldn t be surprising that the chief have only lost at home once this season  and it took the charger converting a last second two point conversion to do it   they re the no    seed in the afc  and arrowhead is a notoriously loud and uninviting environment for visitor   <BRK> the patriot don t have to hit the road often in january  but when they do  they  struggle   at leat a much a the patriot ever struggle  they re just     a the away team in the brady belichick era  brady s three win are actual fewer than mark sanchez ha in his postseaon career   in fact  one of sanchez s four road win wa also one of the patriot  three home loss  <BRK> fewer road playoff win than mr  butt fumble himself  how embarrassing   <BRK> panic index  the best possible news for the patriot is the game isn t in denver  where three of their four loss have come  the next best possible news is that they re not facing peyton manning  who handed them three of those loss  two with the bronco  one with the colt    <BRK> last week  the chief and young patrick mahomes rolled the colt in a game that began a little snowy  the weather could be even more treacherous sunday afternoon  then again  the patriot aren t going to be scared of a little  arctic blast   their first ever playoff win with brady came in the infamous  tuck rule  game   <BRK> and that s awful news for the chief  <BRK> belichick ha historically owned the veteran kansa city coach  with a     head to head record against him that includes a     record in the postseason  the good news is reid s chief put up    point in each of those two win  and they both came in the past four season  the bad news is neither one of those victory came after september  <BRK> reid will get a chance to boost his winning percentage against the five time super bowl winner from    to    by handling the the defending afc champion at home  but reid hasn t been inspiring in conference title game in the past  he s just     when a shot at the super bowl is on the line  but     in the divisional and wild card round  <BRK> on top of that  tom brady ha faced   quarterback in his illustrious career who were playing their first postseaon a an nfl starter  he han t lost to a single one of them  so history isn t particularly thrilled about the chief this weekend  either  <BRK> panic index  on the other hand  the weather in kansa city sunday is calling for frigid temperature and the patriot start a   year old quarterback  sure  brady wa great in last week s   degree day against the charger  but a   degree day is an entirely different beast  you know who move well in   degree weather  polar bear and that s it  even penguin  evolved behind billion of year of graceful as bird gene stumble around like drunk little waiter when it s cold  <BRK> the chief can turn brady into a little drunk waiter sunday  especially if chris jones  dee ford  and justin houston are on point  <BRK> the new orleans saint aren t the most explosive team offensively  they re at their best when they re picking opponent apart with unstoppable drive  like the   play touchdown drive against the eagle that took nearly the entire third quarter  <BRK> that efficiency got them a close     win over philadelphia in the divisional round  but the saint are probably going to need more point to beat the potent offense of the ram  <BRK> that s going to be tough if drew brees continues to struggle to make any throw downfield  on his first play from scrimmage against the eagle  brees badly underthrew ted ginn jr  to set up cre von leblanc with an interception  <BRK> eagle would not be here without cre von leblanc pic twitter com yyrxnpdg p <BRK> early in the second half  brees  struggle to throw downfield almost led to another interception when he couldn t quite get the ball deep enough for taysom hill  <BRK> drew brees ha now underthrown   different sure thing deep ball touchdown v  the eagle pic twitter com db zlizqf <BRK> this is a problem that started creeping up on the saint late in the season  in the first three month of the year  brees wa   of   on pass at least   yard downfield with   yard  nine touchdown  and one interception  in december  he wa just   of   for   yard without a touchdown  <BRK> panic index  the saint are going to need big play against the ram  the raider were the only team that allowed more pas play of   or more yard than los angeles  but thanks to the defensive line   led by the destructive ability of aaron donald   the ram don t give up many lengthy ball control drive  <BRK> there will probably be explosive play to be had against the ram  if brees can t make the throw  the saint may get bounced  <BRK> one of the better game from the regular season happened in week   when the saint beat the ram     in new orleans  now  it s the playoff  the saint have home field advantage again and just battled back from a slow start and a     deficit to host the ram this week  so a repeat of week   is pretty much fait accompli  right   <BRK> maybe not  that wa a different ram team  one that didn t have the cornerback who s made himself the man of the hour with f bomb   aqib talib   <BRK> in that game  saint receiver michael thomas wa a one man force  catching   of   target for   yard and a touchdown  he mostly saw marcus peter  though  talib wa sitting out with an ankle injury  he missed week   through     without talib in the lineup  the ram allowed an opposing passer rating of       th   according to pro football focus   with talib  opposing qbs had a rating of just      third    <BRK> and even if talib isn t on thomas exclusively  the rest of the secondary benefit from having him back there  just look at marcus peter  number   <BRK> qbs targeting marcus peter in week       of      yard    tds    int      passer ratingqbs targeting marcus peter in week       of      yard    tds    ints      passer rating <BRK> they ll need it  this is the biggest test this ram defense  hell  the whole team ha faced   <BRK> panic index  there s no easy path to winning in new orleans for the ram  but they can do it  it might end up being more of a war of attrition  but at least they ll have all their people ready to play   and perhaps eat some gumbo  <BRK>
