   why the leaf no play good  the toronto maple leaf are       in their last ten game   this is upsetting  <BRK> now  the leaf are also still second in the atlantic conference  and they did play notably well against the best team in the universe on thursday  and won    but that s not the point   we lost  we are sad  <BRK> i m not telling anyone not to feel feeling or anything  but could i maybe suggest something  scale your upset a little bit   here is a convenient     scale for leaf upset  <BRK>    auston matthew only score two goal in a game <BRK>    the leaf win based off only trying for ten minute in the third period <BRK>    garret spark  he just make people upset  <BRK>    the leaf lose to a bad team  but it s mostly goaltending <BRK>    the leaf lose to a bad team  and they look like as butt <BRK>    the leaf lose two out of three  <BRK>    the leaf lose six out of seven <BRK>    the leaf lose like twenty consecutive time <BRK>    dave nonis is hired to come in and clean up the mess <BRK>    david clarkson is back <BRK>    you know who would be a good fit for the coaching job  randy carlyle  <BRK>    this team need to play with pugnacity  testosterone  truculence and belligerence <BRK>    scientist have figured out how to raise the dead  and for some reason they resurrected harold ballard  <BRK>    i will show you fear in a handful of dust <BRK>    the movie watching with eyelid pinned open scene from clockwork orange but it s just different leaf playoff loss to boston  forever <BRK>    phew   again  it s legit to be unhappy the leaf are losing  or when they display dangerous flaw   it s also totally good to question why that might be  see below    but it feel a little early to go all the way to   on the     scale  the way everyone want to do  <BRK>    but seriously what the hell is going on with william nylander  part i   it s simple   william nylander wa on an expedition to egypt with a ragtag group of anthropologist and adventurer   he cracked the tomb of an ancient pharaoh   the curse of akhenaten descended upon him  and now he will never score again  <BRK> no  all right  well  let s start with the easy number   nylander s shot total are excellent   he s the best expected goal player on the team  according to corsica   he is shooting      the pat answer here is that he s not a    shooter  i agree  and this will bounce back  and it will be fine   don t worry   be happy  <BRK> there is something that stand out in william nylander s number  though  and it s exactly what the eye test would tell you   at  v   on a rate basis  he miss more shot than anyone on the team   now  some of this is a function of taking a lot of shot nazem kadri and auston matthew also miss the net bunch  but they hit the net way more than nylander doe   if you compare missed shot to shot on goal  nylander s rate is unnervingly high  and exceeded only by offensively limited forward like connor brown and par lindholm   this is not the company nylander should be keeping statistically  <BRK> the notable thing about this is that while nylander ha always missed his share of shot  he s missing way more of them this year than last      missed shot per   at  v  rather than     last season    he is not permanently bad at this   and in case you forgot  he clear   point two year running  <BRK>    but seriously what the hell is going on with william nylander  part ii  the baffling thing to me ha been that in recent game the florida game notwithstanding  where the whole team wa trah he s looked like he s playing pretty well   he s making an intense effort   he s trying to get in on the forecheck  to play good defence   he s carrying through the neutral zone a well a ever   sometimes he seems to hold onto the puck too long waiting for the perfect play  which is a problem  but he also ha the skill to hold onto it longer than the vat majority of player   it s just he can t hit the fucking net  <BRK> armchair psych is always dangerous  but i think there s a decent amount of evidence that william nylander is overthinking the hell out of his game   it s hard to blame him  <BRK> william nylander   i ve never had a slump like this in my life  so  you re just trying to find a way to work through it  you just have to work harder   harder   <BRK> he sure look like he s trying to go top corner every shot  or like he s waiting for that perfect pa  and he s telling himself he just ha to be better   this is pretty understandable  and it s also probably making his life a lot harder   so after all that   my advice to nylander would be the same a coach have given to slumping player since time immemorial  <BRK> puck on net   shoot for the pad   shoot it right at the goalie if you have to   just put it on net without thinking  again  and again   given the rate at which he get good shot location  and the quality of his number in other aspect  there s no point trying to fix the thing that ain t broke   a shot that miss the net isn t going in   a shot on target even a bad one might  <BRK> and  well  once a few of those do  you re off to the race  <BRK>    what is going on with auston matthew   he s shooting slightly le than he wa at the start of the year and he s not shooting at an insane percentage anymore   neither difference is enough that i m really worried  and it s worth noting that he recently got a linemate to whom it make sense to defer shot to now and then  even if william doesn t seem to be hitting the net at the moment  <BRK>     is mike babcock doing a decent job   this is a result business  a people are fond of saying  and lately the result have been a disappointment for a team that view itself a a contender  <BRK> the complaint about babcock are basically <BRK> a  the system is bad <BRK> b  he s too quick to lean on certain type of lesser forward player when thing aren t going well <BRK> c  he s too bound to his defence pairing <BRK> the system is imperfect  and yet it get more shot result  and good goal result  often than not  there are time when the leaf look stifled  and yet every team ha it off night   i think babcock is a little too quick to go to connor brown  who just doesn t add much offensive spark anywhere  but i also think the line blender is a pretty natural tool for a coach when thing aren t going well  <BRK> doe he overrely on hainsey and zaitsev   yes  i think he doe  <BRK> a lot of this is due to limited option   i will be honest and say i would not expect travis dermott is going to sustain his result playing on his off side top four   would he be better than hainsey at this point   probably   is justin holl going to come in and make a major difference  i doubt it  <BRK> all the same  i think every fanbase ha problem with every coach of this nature   these all tend to be strong willed men  so far they re all men  who grinded their way up the rank   without a lot of self confidence  a willingness to stick to their gun  they wouldn t be in the nhl    <BRK> so i think every coach is going to have idiosyncracies   you can call them out and want him to change them   yet i ve seen mike babcock change his mind over time  and change his use of player  e g  leo komarov and matt martin lat year   and in the end i think mike babcock is a clear net positive a a coach   i have no one i d want to replace him with  and to be honest  i don t think i m anywhere close to changing my mind on that  <BRK>    effort   okay  enough nerd chitchat  the team just need to get it together and play like they mean it  <BRK> this is the answer on sport talk radio and half the internet every time the team loses twice   and you know what  sometimes i think the team just doesn t try all that hard   justin bourne had a piece about this lately where he talked about the team sometimes making the easier  or higher risk choice  over the more coach approved play   this is pretty understandable even if it s not laudable   the season is long   the leaf  still  very reasonably expect to be a playoff team   if the leaf had peak scotty bowman behind the bench i still wouldn t think the second night of a back to back against a wimpy florida team in january wa going to get the adrenaline pumping to max  <BRK> it suck   it suck especially if you paid to watch the game   it s brutal   but it happens  it s on the coach to some extent to make sure it doen t happen too often  and sometimes that doe mean giving some player a kick in the as this is why i cut babcock some slack for his line blender in game where the team doen t have it   if this is a recurring problem  and this slump doe turn into a spiral  babcock will have to own that   i don t think it ll happen  <BRK>    this is the bullet where i remind you the leaf were playing their third string goalie for a lot of the past month   he wa fine   but just saying  <BRK>    the leaf are still second in the atlantic   it s not a cozy  comfortable lead  and i want them to steady   even good team slump  though  and if this is the depth of the slump  they ll survive if just fine  <BRK> if they lose to arizona i m gonna be livid  though  <BRK>
