the most predictable reaction to nba all star weekend is the idea that the slam dunk contest wa boring and or bad   <BRK> when someone like oklahoma city hamidou diallo come along and doe a dunk that s so spectacular that it take everyone s breath away  he is burdened with the mission of bringing the dunk contest back  yet even when that happens  the individual brilliance is not enough  the conversation about the dunk contest position the competition a being in an almost permanent state of disappointment  always in need of saving  and yet  always on the edge of returning to some former glory   <BRK> the former glory of the dunk contest doesn t really exist  great dunk contest are rare in the overall history of the event  there s the vince carter show in    the most iconic performance to date  michael jordan and dominique wilkins showed off a great collection of dunk in    spud webb s win in   wa memorable because of his     height  most recently  the   showdown between zach lavine and aaron gordon is still the most ridiculous oneupmanship ever  aside from those few instance  there are some great dunk  like diallo s  scattered within year that were considered letdown   <BRK>

   <BRK> that mean the dunk contest is burdened by an exceptional idea of itelf rather than it norm  it supposedly need to be brought back to the few time when it superseded itelf  a if those rare moment were and should be the standard  any event that s judged by the time when everything went perfectly is naturally going to be a disappointment most of the time  because it s hard for it to live up to myth of itelf   <BRK> critic also misunderstand  or at least fail to acknowledge  what the dunk contest is exactly and why failure is an inherent aspect of such a performance   <BRK> in contrat with saturday s other marquee event  the   point shootout  the dunk contest is physically and mentally demanding work  that s not to say the   point shootout is eay  participant need an intense focus  the ability to repeat their shooting motion perfectly a they rotate around the court  and the stamen to accomplish all of that within a minute   <BRK> but where shooting is more about technical proficiency and doing the same motion well over and over  the dunk contest is about physical creativity  player in the   point shootout aren t tasked with coming up with new way to shoot  but those in the dunk contest have to conjure up new dunk every year and have the physical quality to complete them   <BRK> the   point shootout is a replication of what shooter do in practice  it s the base of their craft  the dunk contest  on the other hand  is something else entirely that participant must practice on their own time  a shooter can practice put up     shot a day  but it s physically impossible for a dunk contest participant to practice their own move to that extent  even though they might need to in order to pull them off seamlessly   <BRK>

   <BRK> audience also want to be amazed  so they judge dunker against their fellow competitor and those from the past  no one want to see the same dunk from different people  regardless of how great the dunk themselves are  this is why prop have become so common  there s only so many different dunk player can do with just the ball and their body  <BRK> the dunk contest is even divorced from the actual act of dunking  in actual game  player power dunk over defender  success is le about the creativity of the dunk and more about the physical dominance against an opponent   <BRK> dunk contest dunk are so much harder  because the player now ha to find a way to replace the awe of physical dominance with ingenuity  wherea the   point shootout is eaier than player shooting against opponent flying at them within the course of a game  dunking away from a game increae the difficulty because there are no opponent to act a reference point for the audience  most great power dunker in the league would be awful in the dunk contest   <BRK> yes  the player in the dunk contest are athletic marvel  but they re punished by the very nature of their work  perfecting any motion  especially one like a creative dunk  involves many failure and few success  the problem with the dunk contest is that people get to see that process a it play out  and not the end result of that process  some player manage to get the dunk right on their first try  but it s never surprising to see that many of them don t   <BRK>

   <BRK> with all of that in mind  the idea that a dunk contest is disappointing when it s not transcendent is both understandable and a weird position to take  something a demanding a the dunk contest should really be judged by the greatness of the best dunk  if you view the dunker a artist  then it s eaier to marvel at their materpieces than sneer at the sketch that ended up in the trah bin  what we should be looking for is those transcendent moment where dunker redefine what the human body is capable of doing  instead  the competition set u up to be upset that they re not consistently achieving a near impossible tak   <BRK> then again  the pervasive idea that the dunk contest always disappoints may be necessary to set the stage for those exceptional year  when player like gordon and lavine do the difficult so effortlessly  it stick in our mind and heart forever  if every year wa like that  it d feel boring  <BRK> ultimately  the dunk contest simply doesn t need to be saved  we have to see so many participant fail  to stay aware of how hard creative dunk actually are  for u to really appreciate the year when everything go perfectly   <BRK>
