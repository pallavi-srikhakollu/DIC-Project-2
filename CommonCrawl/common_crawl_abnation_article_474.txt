at first glance  giannis antetokounmpo is the linchpin to the buck  defense  which is just decimal point away from having the top defensive rating in the nba  it sits at a     heading after wednesday night s win over the memphis grizzly   he s the generational talent who can quite literally defend all five position and do so successfully  both his steal      percent  and block percentage      percent  are above average for his position a well  he s a dark horse candidate for defensive player of the year  but despite all of the hype  head coach mike budenholzer ha actually designed his defense around brook lopez <BRK>lopez is the center of attention because of what he can t do and because of what he can  the seven footer ha cement block for foot and would get blown by on the regular if he tried to defend at the three point line  budenholzer know this  lopez know this  heck  the whole nba know this <BRK>his complete lack of lateral quickness appears to be the motivation for why the buck employ a deep drop on pick and roll  the deep drop mean lopez literally backpedals into the lane on a ball screen and prevents the ball handler from getting a shot around the rim <BRK>against some pull up specialist such a damian lillard  kemba walker or kyrie irving  the strategy can be dangerous  the buck give up the most three point attempt in the league at     per game  a lot of those come in one of two way and both involve the ball screen  pull ups or hitting the popping big man <BRK>regardless of the weakness of the defensive scheme  budenholzer ha stuck with it  because it work  <BRK>lopez  strength a a defender far outweigh his weakness  he s extremely smart  he s disciplined  he s a big body  and he s very long  this combination make it extremely difficult for team to score in the area that s supposed to be the eaiest  at or around the rim <BRK>thanks in large part to lopez  the buck sport the lowest opponent field goal percentage in the restricted area at     percent  <BRK>following the ball screen by thoma bryant  lopez is temporarily charged with both stopping the ball and the roller  by getting deep into the lane  he s able to slow down the ball handler and buy himself a much time until the on ball defender  malcolm brogdon in this cae  can get back into the play  however  toma satoransky push the pace and try to get a bucket before that can happen  he dump off a one handed bounce pas to bryant who s caually sent away from the rim when he try to score over lopez <BRK>lopez is swatting opponent shot with a lot more frequency this season  his     percent block percentage rank in the  st percentile  and is his highest since the     season according to cleaning the glass  this menacing presence down low ha outright deterred opponent from even wanting to shoot around the rim  the buck are giving up the fewest attempt     in the restricted area per game <BRK>jarrett allen  who is in the extremely rare group of player who can say they ve blocked lebron james  antetokounmpo and blake griffin  get his shot annihilated at the rim here <BRK>the clip begin with allen kicking the ball out to spencer dinwiddie above the three point line  allen then follows his pas and set a ball screen  meanwhile  lopez is already stuck deep inside the paint and only backpedals from there  dinwiddie get lopez to momentarily leave his foot and drop a nifty pas to allen who appears to have a wide open dunk <BRK>fortunately  lopez shed those cement block  quickly get off the ground again and contorts his body like he s doing a yoga move in order to avoid allen s body while ping ponging his shot off the backboard <BRK>one of the main principle of budenholzer s defense in milwaukee is to prevent shot around the rim  they wouldn t be nearly this successful without splash mountain defending the paint at such a high level  and lopez doe that better than anyone  <BRK>he allows     point per possession on shot  around the basket  that don t include post ups according to synergy  that is the best mark for any center in the league and better than any player not named jamal crawford  anomaly   who ha seen the floor in at least   game this season  <BRK>budenholzer deserves a lot of credit for what he s done with lopez and this defense  if we rewind to last summer  the buck had just finished a season where they posted the  th best defensive rating and lopez wa sitting on the free agent market because of the concern around his ability to play  modern  defense at the nba level <BRK>instead of fretting over what the seven footer couldn t do  the buck designed their defense around what he could  heck  they even concocted a specialized game plan for james harden based solely on lopez  great defensive ability  and  for the most part  it worked <BRK>no matter what the buck and lopez do during the regular seaon  they ll continue to have a dark storm cloud hovering over their head until they reach the playoff  the intensity and skill level amp up in april  may and june  the theory is milwaukee couldn t possibly survive and thrive with their defense designed a is <BRK>others aren t so sure  that same thinking is what led to the buck getting lopez on a bargain deal late in free agency to begin with  budenholzer likely plan for the playoff  plan that have lopez front and center of one of the league s best defense  after all  milwaukee s success on that end of the court isn t centered around his deficit  rather his advantage <BRK>
