there isn t a saquon barkley or leonard fournette in the   nfl draft  barkley and fournette were no brainer high first round pick the way the nfl is now  but  yes  if you swear a team should never draft a running back that high  i hear you   <BRK>the   class ha a bunch of guy with value who will come off the board on the second and third day  and maybe one or two near the end of the first round  there are two alabama back  josh jacob and damien harris  there are longtime college producer like benny snell and devin singletary  and some star coming off injury  like rodney anderson and bryce love  but there s also memphis star darrell henderson  who doe a lot of this  <BRK>he s got impressive explosion through the hole  accelerates well after contact  and will absolutely make you look silly if you take an even slightly bad angle toward him  he s got upper body power to shed anyone who try to go high on him  <BRK>but tackling  high  is a relative term on henderson because  well  he s pretty small  he measured     and     at the nfl combine  weighing   pound  he ll be one of the   or so smallest player in the league  though he d have an inch or two on guy like tarik cohen  jacquizz rodgers  and darren sproles  <BRK>he s small  but he doesn t exactly have a c j  anderson  bowling ball physique  he s not built to churn out just a few yard at a time  <BRK>he had that in absolute spade in college  <BRK>by conventional stats  henderson led this draft class in nearly every category  touchdown      yard        yard per carry        and yard per game        he personally had   scrimmage play go for more than   yard  a higher total than even barkley  a human highlight reel  had his last year at penn state  <BRK>advanced stats tell a similar story  in    henderson averaged     highlight yard per carry   a stat developed by sb nation s bill connelly that measure how many yard a player gain after reaching the five yard threshold his offensive line is generally responsible for  that wa the most in the class by four yard  <BRK>while henderson also led the rb class in connelly s marginal explosiveness  which measure how successful play are based on the down and distance  he graded out well in other area  too  he wa fourth in marginal efficiency  which similarly measure how well a player keep his team on schedule  <BRK>there s also all of this  <BRK>one of the best running back in the nation this year  can darrell henderson make it count in the nfl  pic twitter com w kkpddkwz<BRK>for what it s worth  henderson doesn t have too much tread on his tire either  the day of the bell cow back have been fading for year  and since becoming the lead back in production for the tiger  he s shared much of the load with fellow back patrick taylor jr  and tony pollard  henderson only carried   time his last two year in memphis  <BRK>henderson ran a     second   yard dash at the nfl combine  he didn t run agility drill there  but judge his agility for yourself  <BRK>henderson s efficiency is going to go down a he move from the aac to the nfl  he s not going to run for nine yard per carry in the nfl over any significant number of rep  <BRK>with a tiny few exception  a player s college stat line is basically his pro ceiling  henderson ha an elite ceiling  but what s the floor  it might be low  because running back have historically had a brutal time translating their college explosiveness to the league  <BRK>it s almost a if  the more explosive you are in college  the longer it take you to figure out how to be explosive in the pro  combine meaures like broad jump  correlation with pro marginal explosiveness        bench press rep        meaning the more you bench  the le explosive you re likely to be   and vertical jump       are more closely tied to big play potential than how many big play you broke at the college level  and they re still pretty loose correlation <BRK> by the way  the correlation between   time and marginal explosiveness in the pro       no correlation whatsoever  <BRK>you can still bet on his skill   good speed  good agility  and good vision   and work on way to align them with your offense  <BRK>you can look at his strong efficiency number   the nine yard per carry  the     percent rushing success rate that placed him third in the rb class   and see upside there  too  <BRK>you can look at his receiving number     catch  on par with other back in the class  for   yard  with an     percent catch rate   and find different way to use him  <BRK>the team get henderson could be nabbing a day breaker in the draft s late stage <BRK>
