the nfc championship game went to overtime when it had no business doing so  the ram were given the game on a silver platter after an incredible no call on pas interference resulted in a short saint field goal  and with one time out all they needed to do wa march down the field  like they ve done countless time this season  <BRK> instead l a  took nine play to go   yard  burning over a minute of clock time in the process  on paper it really doesn t look that bad  but is it   promise  <BRK> after a few decent play the mistake began with   second left on the clock  the saint defense collapsed in broken coverage giving robert wood an open lane to the end zone  with zero defender in a position to stop him  instead of keeping his footing and scoring what would have likely been a game winning touchdown  he tripped and got a   yard gain  <BRK> this play took the wind out of the offense  and suddenly it wa a if the offense forgot how to move the ball   <BRK> these three play defined the end of regulation  and gave ample cause for the ram to cough this game up when they were put in the driver s seat  there s little doubt the saint were screwed on the non call pas interference  but this moment is really what made the game so close  <BRK> greg zuerlein bailed out the offense with the game tying field goal from   yard  but it doesn t change the fact that the ram  offense lost it teeth when it needed them the most  when paired with sean mcvay s inexplicable decision to kick a field goal from a half yard out  it creates a tapestry of a young team terrified of making mistake on the bigger stage of any of their career   <BRK> we know it s a moot point  the ram went on thanks to a monster   yard field goal from zuerlein in overtime   but it never should have been that close  now a kicker becomes a legend  <BRK> greg the leg end   pic twitter com  aa rirmb <BRK>
