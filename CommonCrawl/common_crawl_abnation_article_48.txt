jaon giambi is among the best example of the mentality of the  s era new york yankee  he wa a regular mvp candidate while in oakland  winning once and receiving vote in two other seaon  once he wa a free agent  the yankee scooped him up  at the time that he hit free agency  after the   seaon  he had been about a valuable over the start of his career a bernie williams over his first seven seaons  he hit better than bryce harper  too  now put a pin in that  because we re going to come back to it <BRK>i ve done a few of these modern day free agent post this winter  a a thought experiment examining how the market for player ha changed  over the pat few year  we ve watched the market change in front of our eye  with a couple of notable trend  first  overall spending on free agent ha declined  while the   clas han t suffered a much a lat year  ben lindbergh s research from that linked article speaks to the shifting sand of free agency <BRK>of course  the top two player on the market are still available  and while they ll boost the spending this winter  the fact they re still available is kind of the point  team are more willing than ever to wait out free agent until their price drop  or not even pursue them at all <BRK>the other major change in free agency is the premium placed on versatility  a bullpen grow ever larger  it becomes more and more important for your position player to be able to field at more than one place on the diamond  dj lemahieu  for example  got about six million more than mlb trade rumor and fangraphs projected he would  mostly driven by the belief he can play three different infield position well  daniel murphy can play at leat two  even if he s now primarily a first baeman  and he got more than the projection thought a well  jed lowrie got exactly what mlb trade rumor pegged in term of aav <BRK>it is in this changing market that we toss a player like giambi  an elite level hitter  with good contact skill  great power skill and wonderful ability to get on base  it s not hard to imagine that he would have been even more high profile in this era  based on the hype aaron judge and joey votto get for consistently running     obp season <BRK>yet he wasn t a great defender at first and nobody would have ever dreamed of asking him to play another position  in a lot of way  he resembled jd martinez  an otherworldly hitter tasked with playing a weak defensive position  or dhing  and both   year old at the time of free agency <BRK>martinez came in well under projection  signing for   mm le than predicted with the red sox  his deal also includes three different opt out  which reduces the level of risk for boston even further  despite being one of the very best hitter in baseball  team just weren t willing to lock up martinez long term  with boston being the only real public bidder for his service <BRK>now  back to bryce harper  harper ha been a worse hitter by about    than giambi over the beginning to their career  and is coming off a terrible defensive seaon in    he s four year younger than giambi wa at the time of their free agency  but it s still very much up in the air a to what he ll sign for  at the very leat  we can be pretty comfortable saying harper will get a contract with multiple opt out to shift risk away from the team signing him <BRK>the combination of factor here suggests that it would have been difficult for giambi to do better than the contract he signed ahead of the   season  he probably would have ended up with a bit more money than martinez  since he wa able to reach base at a higher rate      v    for jdm   and plate discipline tends to age better  i don t see him being able to get a sixth or seventh year though  mostly due to the lack of positional versatility <BRK>giambi is fascinating for a bunch of reason  both real and hypothetical  he wa a great player for the yankee  a   ops  player who reached base more than    of the time in the bronx  yet i think he s seen in a different light than that by fan  and he s the kind of player we ve seen struggle in the new free agent market  his ability to get on base would have made him valuable  but it s not like he d be signing any record breaking deal in a hypothetical   free agency <BRK>
