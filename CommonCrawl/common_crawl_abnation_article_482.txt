he finally made it  after getting hit with the franchise tag two season in a row  le veon bell will finally get to test free agency  the pittsburgh steelers won t tag him a third time  giving the running back a chance to sign a deal that will give him the long term security that he s been chasing <BRK>he should get it  too  bell is an elite offensive weapon who we ve seen have stretch of pure dominance for the steelers over the year  the lat time bell stepped on the field  he finished third in the league with     rushing yard and chipped in   receiving yard a well <BRK>part of why bell is such an intriguing free agent this offseason is that we know he s talented   but he hasn t played in over a year  the   year old didn t play last season after refusing to sign the franchise tender that would have paid him      million in   <BRK>when healthy and on the field  bell is one of the best offensive player in the league  from   to    bell ran for     yard  ranking third in the nfl over that time span  bell also contributed     receiving yard over those four season <BRK>what make bell a unique runner is his patience behind the line of scrimmage  bell will wait for a hole to come open before exploding through for a big gain  here s an example from one of the steelers  game against the raven in   <BRK>bell s ability to elude defender also make him a lethal weapon a a receiver out of the backfield  <BRK>even with the year off in    the idea of adding bell ha to be tantalizing for almost every team in the league  however  bell s service won t be cheap  especially for a player who ha said in the past he want to be paid like a no    running back and no    receiver <BRK>here are four team that could make a legitimate run at bell in the offseason  <BRK>the colt have an abundance of cap space to use to sign bell  indianapolis is projected to have more than    million in cap space  according to spotrac   the highest number in the league  <BRK>that signing would give the colt an offense with andrew luck  bell  and a fierce offensive line featuring rookie all pro quenton nelson  indianapolis also ha promising young running back marlon mack and nyheim hines that would fit well with bell  <BRK>bell would immediately become the top dog a a runner and receiver out of the backfield  in this scenario  bell would be in store for a ton of target since the colt aren t loaded with receiving option outside of t y  hilton and eric ebron  hines wa a solid receiver a a rookie  he averaged     yard per catch in    which is much lower than bell s career mark of     yard per catch <BRK>while a marriage between the colt and bell would make sense  there are two factor making indianapolis a le likely destination for bell  first  general manager chris ballard hasn t really invested high resource into the running back position  none of mack  hines  or jordan wilkins were selected in the first three round of the nfl draft  <BRK>then there s the fact that the colt  running game wa just fine with their trio of day   running back  indianapolis had the  th ranked rushing offense according to football outsider  dvoa metric  <BRK>the colt  first priority should be to inject some talent into their defense and wide receiver group with their boatload of cap space  but if they went after bell  he would absolutely be the best running back on their roster <BRK>simply put  the jet need playmaker and have the cap space to take a major swing at bell  the jet are the only other team in the nfl that ha    million in cap space right now  this is a big offseason for them  they re heading into   with second year quarterback sam darnold and a new head coach with the hire of adam gase  there s going to be a transition period   surrounding darnold with talent could help him take a leap in his second season <BRK>adding bell would give darnold and gase an all pro caliber presence in the backfield and a reliable player to lean on during their offensive transition <BRK>the jet  running back depth chart is pretty barren right now  isaiah crowell  bilal powell  and elijah mcguire aren t in the same realm a bell  crowell had a decent seaon with   yard in   game  but he s expected to be releaed this offseaon  <BRK>mcguire led all jet running back with   receiving yard in eight game last year  bell would provide an elite checkdown option for darnold and make a nice pair of receiving back with mcguire <BRK>the raider have a chance to quickly turn around their misfortune from a year ago  oakland ha a lot of cap space and three first round pick in this year s draft  their defense wa porous last year  but that shouldn t stop the raider from adding offensive playmaker this offseason  they averaged just     yard per play on offense  ranking  nd in the league  <BRK>oakland s offense could use some juice after trading away wide receiver amari cooper to the cowboy for a first round pick  the raider are probably going to give derek carr at least one more year to prove he can be their franchise quarterback  so why not give him all the tool he need to succeed <BRK>bell could come in and be the raider  best option in the run game and the pa game  deandre wahington is the only experienced running back on the raider with a contract in place for the upcoming seaon  marshawn lynch and doug martin are free agent while jalen richard is a restricted free agent   bell would make sense a a bellcow back for an old school coach like jon gruden   if the raider don t mind ponying up the dough  <BRK>it would certainly be a big splah signing for a team getting ready to move to la vega  <BRK>the packer haven t been tied to bell much  but they could be an under the radar fit  they don t have a much cap space a the other team mentioned   they re about at the league average  green bay isn t usually a heavy spender in free agency  either  but giving aaron rodgers  and new offensive minded coach matt lafleur  a weapon like bell could help the packer get back to the playoff after missing them for two straight year <BRK>not only would rodgers and bell become one of the top offensive duo in the league  but bell would also jell nicely with running back aaron jones  who averaged     yard per carry last season  <BRK>bell  jones  and jamaal williams would be a dynamic trio of receiving back  jones and williams both averaged more than     yard per reception  which is right around where bell wa for his final season with the steelers  <BRK>davante adam is the only veteran receiver under contract with the packer  it never hurt to add another dynamic target for rodgers   and another reason to keep him happy <BRK>
