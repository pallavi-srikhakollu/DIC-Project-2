cain velasquez s highly anticipated return wa at least partially spoiled by his infamous nemesis  the injury bug  <BRK> after a   plus month layoff from competition  velaquez s comeback fight in the main event of ufc phoenix on sunday opposite francis ngannou lated just   second  the end came when velaquez attempted to grapple with ngannou and the towering frenchman responded with a few fiery punch in close  velaquez dropped to the mat  then rolled over onto his front  seemingly unable to defend himself a referee jaon herzog stepped in to call the bout  <BRK> velaquez let out a roar of frustration immediately following the stoppage and the replay seemed to indicate that his left knee gave out on him  he confirmed a much at the evening s post fight presser  explaining exactly when the injury happened and how devatating the outcome wa to him  <BRK>  i just can t believe that happened   velasquez said   having a great camp coming in  truly  everything i said  how strongly i felt  that wa all true  coming in i felt great out there  relaxed  and then taking that one step i did with my left foot  i just felt something pop and then when i tried to take another step it just gave out on me  my knee gave out on me  i can t even believe that happened  <BRK>  going in   percent healthy    percent ready and just to have this freak accident  i can t even believe it  it s just hard  that s sport  that s what we do  that s what happens sometimes  it s just really frustrating because the fire in me is strong  stronger than ever  in camp  great camp  great camp  and then this happens   <BRK> velaquez speculated that the injury could have occurred to his meniscus or mcl  though further examination will be required  he felt a pop in his left leg a he advanced and then when he tried to move left again  that s when it completely gave out  making matter worse for velaquez is that a far a he know  there were no previous issue with his left knee  <BRK> upon further examination of the finish  it look like at least one of ngannou s counter punch landed cleanly and velasquez wa asked how much the power of ngannou contributed to the finish and how much of it wa due to his injury  <BRK>  it wa just the knee  he didn t even  like  touch me  you know   velaquez said   it wa just the knee  a soon a i felt the knee just buckle  it wa like i couldn t believe that happened  and then that wa it   <BRK>  going in for his leg  i felt he kind of clubbed me on the back of the head  but that didn t graze me at all   velasquez continued   none of the punch grazed me at all or did anything to myself where i felt like i wa unbalanced or anything  just getting in on the inside and it wa just a freak thing that happened with my knee   <BRK> velasquez didn t fault ngannou for going in for the kill  nor herzog for the fast stoppage  if anything  it sounded like he wa most disappointed in his body betraying him once more  <BRK>  it wa okay because the ref saw my knee buckle   velasquez said   the ref saw my knee buckle  his job is to make sure we re   percent safe and he did that  even for me  just to process what happened in that moment  even afterwards   the ref did the right job  he did the correct job tonight   <BRK>  i have a lot of respect for  ngannou    i have a lot of respect for a lot of fighter  that s just how i am   before the fight  a lot of respect  but i m there to kill him   velaquez continued   after the fight  a lot of respect  especially for him a a man  a a competitor  <BRK>  i beat myself tonight   <BRK> velasquez could not speak on the severity of the injury nor provide a potential timetable for his next bout  when asked if this could be his last fight  velasquez simply said that he ll only stop when he feel like he  can t be the best  and that that wasn t  the case with this whole camp   the   year old already ha two ufc heavyweight reign on his resume  though he now ha just one win in his last three fight dating back to june    <BRK> the keyword for velasquez in describing sunday s fight wa  frustrating   because other than how it all ended  velasquez felt right at home back in the octagon  <BRK>  we ll see what happens going forward   velasquez said   again  knowing what i did these past three year and two month  getting ready for this camp  i felt ready  extremely ready  i felt calm out there  like the octagon wa the place i needed to be and i felt great  it felt great coming back  it felt great in there with him  <BRK>  and then the freak accident with the knee just popping out  it s just frustrating  but we ll get it all checked out  the fire in me is strong again still and i guess i ve got a lot to prove and i m very capable of doing that   <BRK>
