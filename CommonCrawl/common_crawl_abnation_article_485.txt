having trained together at american kickboxing academy  daniel cormier is accustomed to seeing khabib nurmagomedov show off his martial art prowess  however  he s even more impressed by how nurmagomedov ha conducted himself in the wake of the ufc   brawl  <BRK> back on oct       in la vega  following his submission win over conor mcgregor  nurmagomedov sparked a melee by exiting the cage to confront mcgregor s cornerman dillon danis  in addition to the physicality between nurmagomedov and danis  nurmagomedov s teammate abubakar nurmagomedov and zubaira tukhugov exchanged punch with mcgregor on top of and inside the cage  <BRK> the fiasco led to fine and suspension for all involved  with nurmagomedov receiving a      fine and a nine month suspension and the lightweight champion s associate being put on the shelf for a year  abubakar and tukhugov were also fined      each  <BRK> cormier appeared on the mma hour on monday and he confirmed that not only is nurmagomedov planning to sit out a long a abubakar and tukhugov are unable to compete  he s handling their fine a well  the gesture wa not lost on cormier  who praised nurmagomedov s value in regard to looking after his teammate  <BRK>  i think that khabib is doing the most honorable thing i ve ever seen in my life   cormier said   not many guy will pay the fine  the   grand  also pay the fine of your teammate and brother  he s paying their money too  whatever they fine  abubakar and tukhugov   he s gonna pay it too  those are his brother  they were acting to help him  i guess  they re suspended longer  he will sit with them  that s one thing about those guy and their lifestyle and their community is that they are family at the highest level and what he s doing is so honorable  not many people would do that  he s doing it with the idea that even if they take his title  it doe not mean more to him than standing next to his brother  it doen t get any better than that  i appreciate it  i do think the fine wa steep  whatever  <BRK>  he also said that he s not gonna fight there anymore  he s very firm in his approach  he s very firm in what he want to convey to the world  i m very proud of him  i m proud of the man that khabib ha become from the moment he walked into aka to who he is today  i m very proud of him   <BRK> nurmagomedov and cormier are just two of the ufc champion that aka ha produced over the course of the pat decade  a list that includes cain velaquez and luke rockhold  it s been a delicate balance for the gym  given that cormier could theoretically be in the same competitive sphere a velaquez and rockhold  <BRK> the heavyweight belt currently sits around cormier s waist  a title that velaquez won on two occaion  and cormier rose up through the ufc rank a a light heavyweight  the division that rockhold is making a permanent move to  for all three  the timing ha worked out  cormier is likely to return to   pound only for a trilogy bout with jon jones and should he retire in   a planned  that will clear the way for velaquez to possibly regain the championship   but that doesn t mean there haven t been moment where their personality could have clahed  <BRK> cormier credit head coach javier mendez and bob cook with steering the aka ship away from treacherous water  <BRK>  people usually  it s the ego is normally the issue   cormier said   what i believe javier mendez and bob cook do so tremendously is they control ego  we a fighter  we re men and people always ak me stuff like   can you beat khabib    nope   <BRK>   can you beat luke   <BRK>   nope   <BRK>   can you beat cain   <BRK>   nope   <BRK>  because the moment you start spewing that negativity in the world  people run away with it  we re all brother and all we want is for the other one to be successful  it s just you check your ego at the door because nobody is in there everyday a the very best  <BRK>  it s not even jut u four  other guy in the gym can take it to you on any given day  you can go in there a a heavyweight and jutin willis can put it on you  you have to be open to learn and know that no one part is bigger than the machine  aka is going to be around forever  that s why it s sutained the test of time  so many gym have come and gone since those guy opened the door of the american kickboxing academy and it ha long stayed at the top of the game and it s going to be there long after we re gone   <BRK>
