sunday s nfc championship game wasn t pretty  it featured sloppy  tipped interception  weird playcalling  and at least one egregiously terrible call from the official <BRK>but it wa an instant classic   a nailbiter of a game that swung on a pair of two minute drill and wa eventually settled in overtime  the ram proved they could win a sloppy  relatively low scoring affair  and it gave the saint a legitimate gripe with the league after a game changing non call <BRK>what were all the mistake  let s run through them step by step  we ll move in chronological order  which mean all the best  dumbest stuff is waiting at the end <BRK>los angeles could have made a statement by forcing a punt on the saint  first possession in the superdome  new orleans had already converted a third and   into a new set of down  but a stop on third and   would quiet a frenzied crowd and set the tone for an upset on the bayou  instead  la got it wire crossed and   pound defensive lineman john franklin myers wound up covering the   nfl offensive rookie of the year <BRK>it wa a mismatch drew brees noticed immediately <BRK>the   year old quarterback lofted a dime to cap kamara s wheel route  resulting in a   yard gain that set the home team up in field goal range  the saint couldn t turn that into a touchdown  but the ensuing field goal turned what could have been a message sending defensive stand into an early deficit for los angeles<BRK>the saint faced fourth and   from the ram    yard line when drew brees trotted out from the sideline and took his place behind center  while there s a chance new orleans wa lining up to run a play  brees had every intent on seeing if he could find a rube along the la defensive front to barge across the line of scrimmage and give his team a new set of down without any risk attached <BRK>and then michael brockers came strolling up to the line  looking like an in over his head tourist stepping up to a sidewalk game of three card monte  brees had no problem taking his vacation money <BRK>michael brockers  you big dummy  one play later  the saint turned this free first down into a five yard td pas pic twitter com gm pwuzpfd<BRK>one play later  brees hit third string tight end garrett griffin for a five yard touchdown pas that gave new orleans a     first quarter lead <BRK>garrett griffin s second career reception wa a touchdown that gave his saint a double digit lead in the nfc title game  so how did an anonymous third string tight end find the stage to shin in the playoff  well  he got a valuable assist from marcus peter   who play for the ram <BRK>the ram just ran a pick    on themselves pic twitter com s dmwtokl<BRK>gurley only had four touch in the first   minute of sunday s nfc title game  that s shocking   but the way he wa playing  it wa easy to understand why  <BRK>gurley s first two carry resulted in a combined    yard  his first two target went a poorly a they could have  too  his first resulted in a demario davis interception and three saint point to cap the ram  opening possession <BRK>his second target came on another third down play  this one forced the ram to kick a   yard field goal instead of earning another shot at a tide turning touchdown in the second quarter <BRK>route  goodhands  badtodd gurley with his second drop of the game pic twitter com ahlwjr ma <BRK>and he couldn t be relied on when he had the ball out of his hand  either <BRK>gurley whiffed on that blitz pickup against eli apple and then got away with a clear hold <BRK>fortunately  gurley wa able to earn some redemption a the second quarter ticked to a close  his six yard touchdown run pushed his total output into the black and crept the ram to within     at halftime <BRK>the saint  third string quarterback ha been a unique offensive weapon at sean payton s disposal all year  he s a hell of a running back  a force on a special team  and he even caught a touchdown pas from drew brees on sunday <BRK>that wa a good way to use the   pound swiss army knife  putting him at quarterback and splitting brees out wide wan t <BRK>the saint tried several time to put hill at quarterback  but it ended up being too cutesy and blew up in new orleans  face over and over  it almost created a turnover for the saint when a read option play with hill and alvin kamara caused a fumble <BRK>aaron donald is a cheat code  part     pic twitter com y ive l xj<BRK>hill can do so many thing for the saint  but it probably would ve been smart to just stick with brees   the nfl s all time leading passer   at quarterback  fortunately for the saint  however  it turn out there s at least one good non fake punt way to use hill <BRK>noted nfl wide receiver taysom hill pic twitter com kxgt gm <BRK>the saint were working to salt the clock away before kicking a game winning field goal after a   yard pas to ted ginn jr  set up a brand new set of down at the ram   yard line  three run would have wound the clock down to approximately one minute left and a   yard field goal attempt even if they d all been stuffed at the line of scrimmage <BRK>instead  sean payton dialed up a too aggressive pas play on first down that bounced to michael thomas  stopping the clock  a stuffed run burned the ram  second timeout and brought up third and   with     to play  <BRK>convert it  and new orleans would all but seal up the game  blow it  and la would get the ball back with more than   second to either tie the game or take the lead <BRK>and then this happened <BRK>that s tommylee lewis getting absolutely lambated by nickell robey coleman with both a helmet to helmet hit and one that looked a whoolllllle lot like pa interference  or  a our own alex kirsher described it <BRK>tommylee lewis wa running a little wheel route on third and   from the ram    yard line  with the score tied at   in the final two minute of the nfc championship  he wa about to catch it just shy of the first down marker when robey coleman annihilated him <BRK>there s a decent bit to the pi rule  but the biggest thrust of it is that  contact by a player who is not playing the ball that restricts the opponent s opportunity to make the catch  is not allowed  well  that mean you can t destroy a receiver well before the ball arrives if you  yourself  are not looking at the ball or making any effort to catch it <BRK>robey coleman admitted he d gotten away with one after the game <BRK>robey coleman   yes  i got there too early  i wa beat  and i wa trying to save the touchdown <BRK>los angeles stuck with viper like efficiency  driving   yard in five play to set up first and   at the saint    yard line  that left   second to gain extra yardage for a game tying field goal attempt  or plenty of time for a few shot at the end zone  <BRK>instead  the ram ran the ball once and attempted a pair of short pass before settling for a   yard field goal to send the game into overtime  <BRK>thomas ha been the saint  most explosive receiver in    an all pro presence who ha carried the new orleans offense when it ha needed him the most   but when dante fowler brought the pressure that caused brees to loft up a floater  he wa unable to showcase the vision that made him one of the game s most dangerous threat  instead getting caught up hand fighting with john johnson  <BRK>  iamjohnthethird interception confirmed     pic twitter com dtilfv eq <BRK>the ram rode a combination of skill and luck a brees  aborted pas landed right in the chest of a falling johnson  who had the wherewithal to haul in the pas from his back  that ended the saint  opening overtime possession   and set up greg zeurlein s game winning   yard field goal that ended new orleans  seaon in front of a stunned home crowd <BRK><BRK><BRK>
