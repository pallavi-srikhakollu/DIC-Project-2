the return of selection sunday mean that sometime in the next couple of day you will be asked to fill out an ncaa tournament bracket  if you haven t been paying attention to college basketball this season but don t want to embarrass yourself in front of co worker family friend  this can be a daunting task  thankfully  we re here to help with   bracket tip you can ride to an admirable finish in your bracket challenge   <BRK>  just want to peek at our pick  instant march madness prediction from our college basketball expert  <BRK>    have at least one non top seed in your final four  <BRK> it s tempting to go chalk and wind up with a final four of nothing but no    seed  but history show that s not the way to go  the lat weekend of the tournament ha featured all four no    seed just one time     since the event expanded to   team  three no    seed making it to the final four ha been nearly a unique  happening just five time  plus  picking all four no    seed is boring  march isn t about being boring    <BRK>    don t pick a no    seed to win it all  <BRK> there s always a lot of chatter this time of year about how  anything can happen in march    a lot of thing can happen in march  but a   seed winning the national title doesn t seem to be one of them  every seed line from     ha produced at least one national champion besides the   seed line  no    seed have made it to the title game three time  but have never been able to be the last team standing   <BRK>    believe in at least one  first four  team  <BRK> even though the  first four    those four game in dayton on tuesday and wednesday featuring the lowest seeded four team in the field and the last four at large team to get in   ha been fairly controversial and often mocked since it inception in    a team coming out of dayton ha won at least one game in the tournament s  main draw  in every year since the first four became a thing  that trend continued last season when syracuse defeated arizona state in dayton  then knocked off both tcu and michigan state to crash the sweet    overall  the first four ha produced four sweet   squad and a final four team in vcu  pick one of the four last at large selection to this year s field and ride that team to at least the second round of the big dance   <BRK>    roll with one wild card final four pick <BRK> sure it s scary to take one team that could easily lose in the first round and advance it all the way to the final four  but it s also smart  every single final four since   ha featured at least one team seeded no    or worse  since    a total of nine team seeded seventh or worse have crashed the season s final weekend  so take the three team you like the most to the final four  and then throw a dart in the region where you feel like the top seed are the most vulnerable   <BRK>    pick at least one   seed to win in the first round  <BRK> the     upset is a march madness tradition unlike any other  in   of the last   year  at least one   seed ha advanced out of the first round of the tournament  over the last   year    seed actually own a highly respectable overall record of     against five seed  it almost always happens at least once  so pick a   seed you like and go ahead and move them onto round     <BRK>    take a close look at the     matchup a well   <BRK> we just talked about the frequency of the     upset in the ncaa tournament  but how about some love for the work the no    seed have been putting in recently  at least one   seed ha won a game in the tournament in eight of the last   year  last season it happened twice  with marshall taking care of wichita state and buffalo blasting arizona   <BRK>    pick at least one  major  upset  <BRK> even if you don t like any of the   or   seed this year  pick at least one stunner in your bracket  at least one top four seed ha lost in the first round of   of the last   ncaa tournament   <BRK>    go back and look at the conference tournament before settling on a national champion  <BRK> no team ha ever lost the first game of it conference tournament and gone on to win the ncaa tournament  if you re backing a squad that went one and done in it league tourney to win the big dance  you may want to reconsider  looking at you  lsu  texas tech and purdue   <BRK>    avoid the trendy     team  <BRK> every year on selection sunday  there is an underachieving major conference team that get thrown into the      death game  and leaf everyone predicting that they will upset the no    seed in round    that team almost always get caught looking ahead  or just isn t a good a people want them to be  and doesn t make it out of the first round  don t fall for the hype   <BRK>    be wary of the tournament s no    overall seed  <BRK> the ncaa tournament selection committee began designating a no    overall seed in    since then  that team ha gone on to win the national championship just three time   florida in    kentucky in    and louisville in    the best team doesn t always win this thing  and in fact  the odds are against it  the best example  last season of course  when no    overall seed virginia became the first top seed to lose in the first round   <BRK>    conference championship matter  sort of   <BRK> in the history of the ncaa tournament  there have been only four national champion  who participated in a conference tournament  that didn t first win either their league s regular season or postseason title  villanova in    kansa in    connecticut in    and duke in   are the exception   <BRK>    be careful when picking a big ten or west coast team to win it all  <BRK> one of the longest running debate in college basketball is when a team from the west coast or big ten will win it next national title  a big ten team hasn t won it all since michigan state in    and a west coast squad hasn t cut down the net since arizona stunned kentucky in    gonzaga came one win away from ending that streak two season ago   <BRK>    don t automatically move all four no    seed to the second weekend  <BRK> in   of the last   year  at least one no    seed ha been knocked out of the tournament before the sweet    a year ago  both north carolina and cincinnati were   seed that failed to win multiple game in the dance   <BRK>    roll with at least one surprise elite eight team  <BRK> maybe you re not comfortable getting too crazy with your final four  but at least make sure your elite eight ha some flavor  in each of the last eight season  at least one team seeded seventh or worse ha played in a regional final  and in each of the last three season  at least one double digit seed ha made it to the elite eight   <BRK>    don t feel bad about picking a no    seed to win it all  <BRK> even if you re not going with the overall no    seed  see rule no      don t let anybody shame you for picking a top seed to cut down the net  since seeding the field began  no    seed have won more national title     than all other seed combined      that trend continued last season with no    seed villanova claiming it second national title in three year   <BRK>  <BRK>
