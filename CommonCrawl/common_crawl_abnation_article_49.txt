  <BRK>csac will not take disciplinary action against jones  executive officer andy foster said  this is the same  long term m  metabolite that jones wa suspended   month for stemming from a july   sample collection in relation to ufc    foster said  foster said subsequent drug test on jones done by vada  ufc partner usada  and the commission have come back clean since the in competition abnormal reading  including fight night test <BRK>foster said he checked again this week with sport medicine research and testing laboratory  smrtl  lab director dr  daniel eichner and eichner stood by his previous statement that there wa no evidence that jones had re administered a banned substance and no performance enhancing benefit <BRK> i spoke with the scientist   foster said   they stand by their original statement  nothing ha changed  we ve already punished jon jones for the m  metabolite  which is a long term metabolite  there s no ground to charge somebody twice for the same violation  <BRK>this is the very same metabolite that came up in jones  drug test result multiple time between august   and december    the last of which coming on dec     which led to the nevada athletic commission  nac  not wanting to license jones to fight at ufc   without a proper hearing  <BRK>with nevada unable to bring him before the commission until this month  the ufc moved the entire ufc   card  originally scheduled for la vega  to southern california  foster  who had dealt with jones  ufc   situation  already had an understanding of the case and he trusted the word of eichner and other expert that there wa no evidence that jones had taken any new prohibited substance  smrtl is the lab that analyzed all of the jones test that have turned up the metabolite <BRK>the published science on oral turinabol state that the m  metabolite of oral turinabol can be detected in someone s system for   to   day  though no new peer reviewed study have been done since    because turinabol is an illegal drug  this in competition sample dec    wa collected about   month after jones initially tested positive for the metabolite  per usada and the ufc  the science in these case is evolving and the amount found in jones  system is ultra trace down to the picogram level <BRK>ufc vice president of athlete health and performance jeff novitzky told mma fighting that he s not at all surprised that the m  metabolite is still in jones  system and  pulsing  or showing up at different time  novitzky said expert have theorized that the metabolite pop up in drug test when jones is cutting weight or doing heavy exercise  which could explain the weigh in day abnormal reading  like csac  usada will not be taking any action against jones for this instance  novitzky said <BRK> science wise  it doe make some sense   novitzky said   once again  there wa no parent compound and none of the short  or medium term metabolite  which tend to stick around for three or week  so this is even more indicative that for whatever reason this long term metabolite is just hanging around in these tissue and they get expressed when you re going through weight loss  <BRK>novitzky said usada ha found another ufc fighter  whom he would not name  who is going through a similar  pulsing  situation with the m  metabolite  he had mentioned fighter grant dawson previously a someone who had that metabolite in his system and a similar circumstance  usada ultimately cleared dawson <BRK>novitzky assured that usada is not giving jones a proverbial get out of jail free card every time this steroid metabolite pop up in his system <BRK> i don t think it s a blanket statement that every time that metabolite show up that it s automatically considered no re administration   he said  they re looking at a lot of different factor each time it doe show up  they re looking at biological pasport information to determine  are any of these other level suspicious or raising or dropping  they re looking to see if they can detect any of the shorter or medium term metabolite  it s not accurate to say that every time this express itself in jon it s an automatic free pas  they look at it in detail every time it show up to make sure that everything is consistent with no re administration and no performance enhancing benefit  <BRK>jones     all along ha denied knowingly taking any banned substance  he wa suspended   month in his usada cae stemming from the ufc   positive test  jones wa facing a four year ban a a repeat offender  but that wa reduced to   month when jones provided  substantial asistance   or cooperation in an undisclosed  separate cae  the suspension wa reduced again to   month when arbitrator richard mclaren determined that jones did not likely ingest a prohibited substance intentionally  <BRK>the first time jones  regarded a one of the best mma fighter of all time  tested positive under usada wa in    for the anti estrogen agent clomiphene and letrozol  he wa suspended one year after arbitration in that cae  <BRK>the fight against gustafsson wa jones  first bout since his win over daniel cormier wa overturned at ufc   due to the positive drug test  jones is now scheduled to defend his title against anthony smith in the main event of ufc   on march   in la vega  <BRK>that booking is contingent on jones being licensed by the nac  jones is scheduled to go before the commission in a hearing next tuesday <BRK>
