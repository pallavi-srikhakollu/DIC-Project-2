more than   day have passed since carmelo anthony last played in a basketball game  he is not hurt  he is not considering retirement  he wa merely exiled by a houston rocket team that signed him in august  only to come to the conclusion they no longer want him around the team in early november  <BRK> on monday  they officially ended the very brief melo tenure by trading him and cash to the chicago bull  in a move to save on their luxury tax bill  chicago ha no use for melo and is expected to waive him or trade him again  freeing him to sign with whoever he chooses  <BRK> the question is  can he still bring value to a team   <BRK> the league ha trended away from one dimensional scorer and toward versatile swiss army knife forward who can shoot three  defend multiple position and put the ball on the ground  anthony s biggest tool ha been his scoring ability  he struggled to do that in houston  and his defense didn t buy him any extra playing time  either  <BRK> anthony  though  is still one of the most heralded scorer in league history  still revered by many of his peer  the rocket went out of their way to say their early slump wasn t solely anthony s fault  though their decision to exile him and their success in the week following say otherwise   <BRK> anthony had an unceremonious end in new york when his iso heavy  ball stopping tendency stifled the knick offense  he didn t fit in offensively next to russell westbrook and paul george  and the rocket could not find a fit for him in their high powered offense  we ll see if the nba is indeed a three strike and you re out league   <BRK> but anthony still ha option  according to the athletic s sam amick  there are a few team that make sense for him   <BRK> this is the most obvious scenario  because of anthony s relationship with lebron james and james  mild endorsement of the union  playing with lebron make everybody better right  let s put that to the test  send melo to the lakers and bring him off the bench to score for the second unit   <BRK> the challenge  the lakers do not have an open roster spot and thus would need to waive a player to bring anthony in  there s no obvious player to waive on the roster  a silver screen and roll note  <BRK> ivica zubac s uptick in productivity will probably save him from being the odd man out if the lakers were to waive someone  leaving guy like lance stephenson and michael bealey a the most likely candidate to be ousted due to the addition of anthony  and before anyone aks    no  the lakers would never waive or trade moe wagner or isaac bonga in a carmelo anthony deal  <BRK> still  the lakers have to be the early favorite   <BRK> damian lillard and c j  mccollum actively recruited anthony when he wa looking for a way out of new york during the phil jackson era  anthony could now be best described a an inside out post up threat  a discount lamarcus aldridge if you will  terry stotts made aldridge look like dirk nowitzki  can he make anthony look like lamarcus aldridge  <BRK> blazer s edge had a one word emphatic answer  though  no   <BRK> the jazz were off to a slow start  but they ve rallied midway through the season to make a playoff push like many expected  still  donovan mitchell is their only shot creator  they could use another player who can manufacture offense on his own  off the bench  <BRK> could melo and jae crowder put their small issue aside and work together to get utah into the playoff  the bigger question is whether quin snyder could find a way to hide anthony in that traditionally stingy jazz defense  <BRK> jazz fan at slc dunk  however  are not into the idea  <BRK> the pelican are desperate to surround anthony davis with some help  would you rather have carmelo anthony or solomon hill  <BRK> the hornet are flirting with a playoff push  but they re in danger of missing out if they don t string together some win  nic batum is shooting well  but his output is at a career low  mile bridge is good and could become very good  but he s only a rookie  marvin williams is marvin williams  a stretch four who can defend a few position  what the hornet need is another scorer in the front court who can diversify what it is charlotte can do on offense  <BRK> anthony may be a fit  he could project to pair very well with kemba walker  <BRK> the heat make the most sense out of all of these team  they re a club that could use that type of scoring power on the perimeter  and melo is a bona fide bucket getter  miami ha the best conditioning team on the planet  and they re home to one of his best friend in the league  dwyane wade   <BRK> the heat are also a defensive team with a dominant rebounder in hassan whiteside  their strength compensate for anthony s biggest weakness   <BRK> erik spoelstra is a coach who can fit melo into his scheme and craft different opportunity for him all over the court  if it doesn t work in miami  it won t work anywhere  <BRK> if the lakers won t take anthony  could their crosstown rival snag him to provide extra scoring punch in their playoff push  <BRK> do the spur want to bring a smaller version of lamarcus aldridge off the bench behind the real lamarcus aldridge  if anyone can resuscitate carmelo anthony s basketball career  it s the guru himself  gregg popovich  <BRK> they could use another punch off the bench anyway  why not go for gold  <BRK> because why not  the warrior have an all star laced lineup and demarcus cousin just returned to the rotation  the only question mark is depth  it would be petty for golden state to take a player the rocket exiled and use him against them in the western conference final anyway  <BRK> some fan have pointed to the sixer a a potential landing spot for anthony  and on one level it make sense  they re starting wilson chandler at the power forward slot and are one of the team that have inquired about trading for new york s noah vonleh  anthony  though  traditionally ha not been a great defender  and the power forward position is taked with switching on screen nearly every possession  <BRK> are jimmy butler and joel embiid s defensive prowess enough to compensate for melo s mistake  the  er are already working through their own chemistry issue  adding anthony to this mix might not be the best idea  <BRK>
