sonny gray s brief and disappointing stint with the yankee ha come to an end  even though we knew this wa coming  it s still not a good feeling now that the moment ha arrived  i remember how excited we all were when new york acquired the former cy young award finalist at the   trade deadline  we anxiously awaited the news while the rumored deal wa in the work  and reacted enthusiastically when we learned that gray wa finally a yankee <BRK>i previously wrote about how the yankee  handling of gray left a lot to be desired  i won t rehash all of those point here  but a quick analysis doe reveal that gray s departure figure to have a negative impact on the yankee   at least in the short term <BRK>the yankee rotation now appears set with luis severino  mashiro tanaka  james paxton  j a  happ  and cc sabathia  one problem here is that sabathia ha chronic knee problem  doesn t typically pitch deep into game  and recently had another health scare   this time involving his heart <BRK>i love sabathia and i m glad the yankee re signed him  but the team would have been stronger with him a the long man in the bullpen and standing by a rotation depth  the yankee would have been able to do precisely that  had they been willing and able to fix gray  unfortunately  they opted not to go that route  and the roster is now weaker a a result <BRK>chance adam  domingo german  jonathan loaisiga  and luis cessa now comprise the team s rotation depth  based on what we ve seen so far  the latter three have proven more valuable pitching out of the bullpen  while adam ha yet to demonstrate that he belongs on a major league roster  <BRK>from      gray compiled the  th highest war       among the   pitcher who started big league game  that place him among the top ten percent of all starter  right behind tanaka      war  and j a  happ        but well ahead of sabathia        getting gray back to his previous level of effectiveness would have given the yankee pitching staff a big boost for the   campaign <BRK>it s not just sabathia s health that is cause for concern  and i certainly don t mean to hang it all on him  the lat time the yankee had a many a four pitcher make at leat   start apiece wa    that track record demonstrates a need for quality rotation depth  the team would have had that with a fixed gray  but now they don t <BRK>in a pre arbitration hearing deal  gray agreed to a team friendly      million salary for the   season with the yankee  the red will now enjoy the benefit of having a talented pitcher take the hill every fifth day   and at such a low cost <BRK>gray s departure now lower the yankee  projected   payroll for luxury tax purpose to approximately         according to cot s contract  the yankee payroll sat at        before the gray deal  that figure includes all player under contract  the        that cot s estimate luis severino will be awarded in arbitration  and the estimated      million in player benefit that each team is required to pay  after subtracting gray s      million salary  and subsequently adding       the major league minimum  for the player who will replace him on the roster  we arrive at that        figure <BRK>the    million payroll estimate put the yankee over the    million luxury tax line by about    million  if that end up being their final payroll  then they would pay a    tax on the overage  in that case  their projected penalty would be about      million <BRK>the team can add around      million more to the payroll without seeing an increase in their   tax rate  once their payroll hit    million  they would pay a    tax on every dollar spent over that    million threshold  if their payroll exceeds    million  they would be required to cough up a      tax on every dollar spent above that    million threshold <BRK>the money saved by dumping gray is far outweighed by the negative impact the trade ha on the roster  barring an unforeseen breakout performance by one of the organization s depth piece  this is a deal that the yankee likely lost in the short term  and it will be year before we know if any of the prospect new york received in the swap pan out <BRK>meanwhile  i suspect that at some point during the   campaign we are going to gaze upon gray s resurgence in cincinnati with envy  wishing he still wore pinstripe  right now  this trade feel like a defeat  the yankee are a weaker team without him <BRK>
