for those who have been reeling from the last three week without nfl football  thing are about to get better  february  th marked the first day that team could designate player with the franchise tag  locking them down for the   season  in just a few day  on february  th  the nfl combine will get underway in indianapolis  the combine end on march  th  <BRK> shortly thereafter  the   nfl season will officially begin  march  th will mark the first day that nfl team can communicate with free agent and march  th at   pm will mark the beginning of the new league year and open season on all free agent  this mean that the next two week are likely to be filled with a lot of negotiation  nfl front office will be working long night  and franchise will do an incredible amount of heavy lifting toward what their team will look like next season  <BRK> the indianapolis colt find themselves in perhaps the best spot of any nfl franchise a this activity get underway  the team is armed with a league leading    million in cap space  per spotrac  and have nine draft pick in april s draft  if chris ballard can be even half a good at finding talent in this group a he wa in    bright thing are coming in indianapolis  <BRK> what will the team do with all of it cap space  though   <BRK> ballard ha made it known that he is open to speaking with marquee free agent and player but that he will stick to the process of determining player value and doe not foresee overpaying for a single player  or for a couple of player  in a desperate attempt to outperform realistic expectation in the short term by sacrificing the team s outlook for the long term  while this doen t mean that a splash signing is out of the card  it doe mean that a big pocket book will likely not move the needle on ballard s philosophy  <BRK> the colt front office ha made it clear the team may be a season or so away from having a locker room culture strong enough to take on player who might challenge it  however  talent overcomes a lot of distraction in the same way that win overcome front office or coaching issue   <BRK> ultimately  the good thing for indianapolis is that there are some key free agency situation working themselves out in a manner that should benefit the colt  consider that le veon bell will become an unrestricted free agent  this mean one of two thing for the colt   <BRK> first  ballard may speak at great length with bell and reach the conclusion that his addition to the offense in indianapolis would propel the unit to another level  he may determine that bell s position in pittsburgh wa entirely reaonable and that the colt  locker room would embrace him a a player it can trust to be there to fight  no matter the circumstance         if that is the cae  indianapolis could shock the nfl world by signing one of the best running back in the nfl and adding him to what would immediately become a stacked unit   <BRK> second  some other team will bust the piggy bank not just in   but likely in the future   leaving the colt in a superior bargaining position this year and in future year for the service of other free agent  <BRK> the same can be said for steelers wide receiver antonio brown  while he is unlikely to enter free agency  he will end up altering the balance for some team  if he come to indianapolis on the cheap  for ridiculously low trade compensation given his ability  the wide receiver  problem  is broadly addressed in one move  if he go elsewhere  he will increase the financial burden on that team and potentially alter the team s draft board  perhaps this aid the colt when the time come in april  <BRK> rumor out of new york suggest that landon collins belief he will not be signing a franchise tag  he could certainly be taking to twitter to gain leverage in contract negotiation with the giant and it is still more likely than note that he will stay in new york but if he hit the market this would be a marquee player at a position of current need  at a very young age  and potentially a nasty combination with malik hooker in matt eberflus  defense  if he go elsewhere  other free agent safety become second tier and perhaps the colt can more effectively pursue them  <BRK> we discussed at length the colt salary cap situation  tried to consider the future and likely contract amount  and how the team may address in house and external free agent  we determined that the team s need were likely pas rush  wide receiver  secondary and defensive line   possibly in that order   <BRK> just this week  rumor have circulated that preston smith will likely not be tagged by the wahington redskin  he wa one of three possible player in our list of target at the position  no matter what happens with the other player  if the colt have a shot to add a player like smith   only   year old   it could be a nice chance to restore his career in a new role  <BRK> while we won t know for week just how team will approach their pending free agent  and many team may have already turned their full attention to the nfl combine  thing are shaping up reasonably well for chris ballard and the colt  there will be solid option available at numerous position of need ranging from franchise level player to meaningful upgrade  even if ballard doesn t sign or trade for the franchise player  the very fact that they exist and will likely receive so much attention can work to indy s benefit  <BRK>
