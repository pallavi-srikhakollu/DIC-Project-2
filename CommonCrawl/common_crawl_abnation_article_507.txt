montreal   there weren t any tear for george st pierre  who dutifully handled all question of his retirement after   year in the ufc at thursday s press conference   in both french and english   with something verging on relief  no more hypothetical fight  no more superfight speculation  no more  when    where  and  whom   or conor  dana  spider  khabib  no more cte talk for that matter  peds  ufc  ufo  the terror of fight night is gone  and so are the doubt and the urge to flee  <BRK>st pierre  the fighter  entered the pat tense   and you know what  he freaking did it  he got out a winner  somehow he navigated the most ridiculous career of any pro athlete   a canada s national treaure  really   and left the damn thing on top  st pierre wa positively mirthful on thursday at the bell centre s mythik lounge talking about fighting a a bygone pursuit  it wa of course more than that  though  he wa exonerated from the prison he built specifically to make himself great  and he knew that we knew  and that wa the unspoken thing being communicated  carlos condit tried to kick his head in  we all saw it  and st pierre not only took it but he got up  <BRK>he said thursday that wa the proudest moment of his career  <BRK> wa  because there won t be any more of that  and goddamnit  this is how it should be  there need to be contentment at the end of such an obsessive struggle  the drive to be the best should at least sometimes go rewarded  fighting tends so tragic  because pride ha this unconscious need to destroy itself  we watched st pierre agonizing through his process for more than a decade  against nick diaz he talked about his  dark place   giving a rare glimpse into how consuming it all became  he wa showing he could compete existentially  too  that he could disappear in self doubt better than anyone  did we know  how can anyone ever  if we could know there would be a million great  it wa a lie  his happiness   a face he put on  and therefore it wa a joy to watch him brush off his sleeve at the end like all of it wan t a big deal <BRK>it wa  though  and it is  <BRK>it s hard to pinpoint exactly what st pierre meant to a sport that needed a professional face at the moment it wa emerging from it taboo origin  wa it the french canadian accent  the suit  the fleur de li  it wa all those thing  but it wa also the professionalim  st pierre brought a meaure of clas to mma when there wa no such thing  it wa incongruous  he wa a sportsman who didn t want to harm his opponent  so much a show he could snatch their soul for a span of   to   minute  however long it took  in some way  his method wa far more cruel than simple punishment  it wa rendering somebody helpless   temporary ownership  he busted open a man s delusion for the public to see  he made people contemplate their own mortality  <BRK>you can t help but think of matt hughes at ufc   in sacramento  or jon fitch getting fitched at ufc    or matt serra in the rematch at ufc    catching his reward for unleashing the insecure monster at ufc    st pierre s brand of business compelled     people to crowd into the rogers centre to fight jake shield  jake shield  st pierre wa an original a side that played with our sense of awe  yet unlike some tyrant  there wan t an outcry to see him defeated  there wa only the fear that one day it would happen  along with some doubt that it wa even possible  <BRK>the thing is  he wan t the unbeatable  he wa the beatable guy that refued to be beat  his mission wa to take out the invincible  and that s the other thing that will stand out about gsp  his denial of complacency  imagine making million in a game predicated on hype  and doubting yourself into psychological advantage  st pierre actively told himself that his opponent wa training harder than him  and wanted it more  and for what  so that he could puh himself to stupid limit and prove himself paranoid  he deceived himself into incredible height  some fighter will go through any ring of hell to show u their heart  st pierre jut wanted to show u his depth went deeper than we imagined  he had a dark place  and a darker place  he could dig a deep a he needed to  <BRK>let s face it  he wan t a wrestler  but he became one by doggedness of sheer will and athleticism  he wan t a jiu jitsu player  but he knew how to conquer those who were  if you wanted to strike with st pierre   or worse  if he wanted to strike with you   there would be hell to pay  check out josh koscheck s fractured orbital at ufc    or b j  penn s face after ufc    his smart got him through  his past  the bully who tormented him  the want of having final say  there wa self preservation at the back of it all  too  even when johny hendricks pushed him for five round at ufc    and michael bisping busted him up at ufc    <BRK>you got the feeling that gsp wa willing to die  and maybe that s what scared him about himself   the fact that for a in control a he wa throughout his career  he couldn t avoid going there if need be in competition  all those fight   nine title defense  two title  and a     record over   year   were some grand adventure  an internal war that had nothing to do with the opposition  it wa always his own private hell paying off on fight night  <BRK>he wa smiling in montreal  thinking back  because he didn t feel the need any longer  <BRK> i think i m famous in canada i think other athlete before me would have been just a famous if not more famous than me  because now with social medium and everything  the tv  you re in touch with the world   he said when somebody pointed out that he d reached the level of canada s greatest athlete   so it s eaier to get access to the whole world  and to be known  i think it s just a matter of technology  <BRK>humble in victory  and humble in retirement  that s gsp  the complicated figure that made it look far easier than it wa  and yet could laugh at the end because he damn well knew better   <BRK>
