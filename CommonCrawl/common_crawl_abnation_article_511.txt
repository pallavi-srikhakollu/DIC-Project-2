i am reading legendary alabama and oakland raider  quarterback kenny stabler s autobiography  snake  with most book  i would wait a few day to finish it before regaling anyone with just a fraction of what s inside  <BRK>this is not an option with snake  a book that is basically  the grape of wrath  but if the okies were from alabama  and one of them  the narrator in this case  had a lightning strike for a left arm and a penchant for fast car  woman  and calling his own play on the field  also it s sexy  unlike the grape of wrath  and no one is broke after the first couple of chapter  and even then it s fine because somehow there s always beer money to spend in mobile  <BRK>this book is not like the grape of wrath at all  a far a i know no adult men get breatfed in it  though baed on the first one hundred page that is entirely possible  there s not even a symbolic turtle in it unless john madden count  which he doe not  because john madden is more like a very anxious but caring bear  <BRK>it s not steinbeck  it s much  much better than that  and it can t wait until i m finished  this is all just in the first hundred page  i will update you when i am done  but this could not wait  <BRK>
