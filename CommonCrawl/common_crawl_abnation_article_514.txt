a interesting and meaningful a finding the extent of a superhero s power is finding their limit  so it go with lebron james  who ha been showing u what he is capable of for   seaons and is now showing u what even he cannot do  <BRK> the l a  lakers were officially eliminated from the playoff on friday night with a loss to the brooklyn net  they are     on the season  with one more loss  they will finish with a losing record for the sixth straight season  if they finish     or worse  they will have secured the worst win loss record of lebron s entire career  <BRK> what this seaon prof above all else is that despite his extraordinary skill and production  at this stage of his career  you need something more than lebron to make the playoff  especially in the western conference  he is not  a most of u thought in july and october and even january  instant excellence in a bottle for a team without much else going for it  <BRK> nba news and link delivered to your inbox each weekday  so you never miss out  <BRK> the lakers front office wa either among those who believed lebron wa enough  or the lakers front office believed that the questionable piece placed around lebron   the meme team free agent and the holdover kid from the preceding tank era   were enough help to let lebron carry the proud franchise back to glory  nope and nope   <BRK> the free agent were largely disaster  especially in the context of the free agent who the lakers had let walk and who signed short term deal elsewhere  brook lopez  julius randle   the kid were actually pretty good  but brandon ingram and lonzo ball suffered major injury down the stretch that wrecked progress  altogether  under the circumstance  you d consider the supporting cast the worst of lebron s career  <BRK> add in that lebron missed more game due to injury than at any point in his career  and that his production wa on the lower end of what he is capable of  and that the fight for the playoff wa especially tough in the west this season   the no    seed will probably end up with   win   and you get a stew of defeat for the lakers  lebron wa a lot  an mvp candidate for a couple month even  but he wa not enough  <BRK>

   <BRK> the last two season we learned that lebron  despite his unparalleled greatness  wa not enough to carry a good supporting cast into a series against the light year ahead warrior and win it  or even really challenge them  now we know a different  le illustrious contour  lebron  at this age  is not good enough to carry one of the league s worst supporting cast to the playoff in a tough conference   <BRK> the open question that will debated in the doldrums a we wait to see the lakers  lottery fate and whether l a  stay in the anthony davis chae is how much this failure said about lebron s future and  thus  the lakers  future  <BRK> like it or not  the lakers  near term future is interlaced with that of lebron  i wrote about why trading lebron is basically impossible for the lakers  even if it s legally allowed  so it s worth assessing how much of the smoldering wreckage we re all admiring should be pinned on lebron v  everything else  <BRK> the lakers were      point per   minute when lebron played  top among regular  and      point per   minute when he wa not on the court  lowest among regular   if lebron played every minute of every game without it impacting his performance  the lakers would be a pretty good team  on the cusp of the no    seed in the west  if lebron never played  the lakers would be in no    place in the west   <BRK> a it stand  given lebron s long injury absence and reduced minute since the playoff became a pipe dream  the lakers are closer to no    than no     <BRK>

   <BRK> so this is really a two fold problem in respect to those on off number  the lakers weren t good enough to guarantee a playoff bid when lebron played  and they were absolutely atrocious when he sat   <BRK> now here s a twist  the cavalier weren t that great with lebron on the court last season       per   minute   but they weren t really  really bad with him off the court       per    and he played an absurd amount of minute  more than       add in the easier schedule for east team and some game by game fortune  and cleveland won   game   <BRK> lebron will have played just about     minute this season  and the rest of the lakers are substantially worse than the rest of the cavalier were last season  so while lebron s personal impact isn t far off from what wa a   win effort just a season ago  everything else add up to make it very much not enough  <BRK> the question then become whether lebron can stay on the court for     minute or so in future season  whether new teammate can help him make a bigger impact when he s on the floor  and whether the non lebron lakers of the future can be better than awful when he sits   <BRK> the solution here is getting better teammate for lebron and hoping lebron remains healthy  which is so obvious and basic that it hurt to write  but it s true  the lakers have a superstar  it is not enough  get him some help and hope for the best  <BRK> we have learned this season that these lakers aren t good enough to allow lebron to return the lakers to glory  and that lebron is not good enough to bring these lakers back to glory  now we see if the front office can change that  <BRK>
