following the shocking but not actually shocking announcement by bruce bochy that he will retire at season s end  the logical question to ask became   who s next   i didn t want to post this on the day because it felt disrespectful and a little bit glib  bruce bochy s career is borderline legendary and i figured we d all take a few day to go down memory lane  <BRK>i m such an idiot <BRK>everybody wa ready to move on  but they had to build up their material over the course of a day  you no doubt saw these odds posted this morning <BRK>these odds for the next  sfgiants manager from  betdsi are wild    pic twitter com xpejytn fd<BRK>    and the giant  flagship cable channel with their own list of name  a well a kerry crowley s write up on the matter  and then there wa this tweet from henry schulman <BRK>judging from response  i guess i have to be a little le subtle  i seriously doubt zaidi is going to hire someone with longstanding  sfgiants tie a the next manager  it will be someone young  cheap and well versed in metric <BRK>that s the idea i had when this all began  that s the most likely conclusion to the new front office s upcoming search  it follows the trend of finding  young  cheap  and controllable  talent to led the organization into it future success  obviously  in the case of a manager   controllable  mean take analytics driven order without questioning them  <BRK>knowing that  it wa pretty easy for me to come up with a potential shortlist  but for the sake of entertainment  i m going to employ the tracy jordan style of commentary and say three serious thing and then a joke  perhaps even several joke  <BRK>those betting odds appear to be pulling from the past twenty year of giant history  they definitely had become predictable in their acquisition and hiring practice  and overall  the historical trend in baseball wa for open manager position to be filled by former manager  i don t expect more than   or   of those name  if any  to actually be considered  <BRK>it used to be that manager worked their way up the rank just like player did in making their way to the big league  now team seem to want people with very little or absolutely zero managerial experience  maybe front office are just using data to have more of an open mind on the hr front or maybe front office just want handsome men to execute their ugly plan for platoon  opener  and pre arb contributor who won t be around long enough to fan favorite  <BRK>still  i believe farhan zaidi when he say that dave robert surprised everyone in the dodger  front office to become their front runner and eventual choice to replace  hahahaha  don mattingly  i believe him when he say  from the crowley article  <BRK> in my experience  the best way to wind up with the best candidate is to be very open minded and not go into the process with any preconceived notion or favorite   <BRK>we also don t know who the next gm will actually be  and they re sure to have their own name  but for now  here s who i think will be obvious consideration <BRK>cleveland hold club option on the manager for next season  but if they decline it  he seems like a good candidate to straddle the line between  old school  and  new school   which is the path of least resistance when it come to season ticketholders and investor or team support who aren t afraid to express their concern or preference  he placed only  th on craig calcaterra s mlb managerial handsomeness ranking  so he fails the handsome face category  but he s adept at managing with analytics and very successful  most importantly  he s a  name brand   <BRK>former a s manager and current dodger bench coach  so farhan zaidi know him very well  he wa also on the dodger  shortlist back in    he seems like a logical candidate based on his connection  especially if the a s current agm billy owen becomes the giant  gm at season s end  <BRK>i don t remember him being a particularly strong manager during his time with the a s  he seemed flummoxed by managing with national league rule   but having been reprogrammed by the dodger  front office  he might be a more flexible candidate for farhan zaidi s need  <BRK>  will be his fourth seaon a the dodger  first bae coach  he s best known to giant fan a the dude who tackled nick hundley during the lat giant dodger brawl <BRK>a little aggressive from dodger  b coach george lombard  no  pic twitter com pheusiyaxp<BRK>this would seemingly be a bad move by farhan zaidi because of the blue bad optic  but point in lombard s favor include  <BRK>currently the a s major league quality control coach  a positioned defined by the a s a <BRK>he will assist bob melvin and the ml coaching staff in all area and will also consult with the front office in other facet of the organization <BRK>it almost sound like an administrative asistant  but if the giant were to hire billy owen a their next gm  someone who understands the front office s shorthand will be invaluable  this would seemingly be a bad move for farhan zaidi because of the green and gold bad optic  but point in kotsay s favor include <BRK>a little aggressive from dodger  b coach george lombard  no  pic twitter com pheusiyaxp<BRK>currently one of the giant  four special assistant to the general manager  a role that ha yet to be filled after bobby evans  departure  farhan zaidi ha a chance to get to know the guy this year and randy winn ha a chance to repeat what he did to land his extension with the giant  impress the hell out of the front office with a really small sample size of staggeringly great performance  <BRK>would randy winn even be interested  i don t know the man  but i also didn t think aaron boone wanted to manage just based on his sunday night baseball work  just because people don t express their pursuit doesn t mean they lack them  besides  i found this image uploaded to the site s asset storage and it would be a perfect one to pair with a post reporting on an announcement that he s a candidate  <BRK>i m envisioning a scenario where farhan zaidi cut pablo sandoval in spring training but pablo fluster farhan by accepting a minor league assignment and sticking around the organization    only to impress the hell out of the new front office over the course of the season  the kung fu panda ha proven himself to be a merchandising powerhouse  a utility player of the zaidist level  and even better  a talent recruiter  farhan just need to get to know him  <BRK>right now  he s a special asistant to ranger  gm jon daniel following his retirement after the   seaon  but more importantly  he s great at twitter  which mean he ha a sense of humor  and you need that when you re the handsome face of the team  one of the largest contract farhan zaidi s ever given out a a general manager wa mccarthy s   year     million dollar contract  he also salary dumped him to the brave lat offseaon  so i d argue that both men owe each other a favor  <BRK>the greatest wild card of them all  <BRK>i don t think any of these guy will actually be considered  but it s important to note that they very easily might ve been had bobby evans kept his job  <BRK>after the great reshuffling of    when the giant moved hensley meulens from hitting coach to bench coach  garnt busbee of the mccovey cove chronicle remarked <BRK>i agree with nightengale s assertion that the giant are grooming meulens for bruce bochy s job  this wa something that i had heard from different people  and when i asked   what about wotus    i got some variation of   _ ãƒ„ _   both time  the answer is that while he doesn t have to be okay with being passed over  he apparently isn t spitting mad  not enough to leave the organization  anyway  <BRK>     <BRK>the meulens move will resonate the loudest in a couple year<BRK>that reasignment came after meulens became a candidate for multiple job opening  a trend that continued somewhat this pat offseaon a both the red and twin interviewed him  now  he might have a chance to impress farhan   co  this year  too  but i would say that the new front office will probably be looking to limit holdover from the previous era <BRK>poor guy  he seems like he s come up short too many time <BRK>he might be one of buster posey s favorite teammate and a medium darling  and would probably be bruce bochy s chosen successor  but let s consider that the giant did not re sign him this offseaon and since he han t it retired  it s hard to see a player jumping straight from a full regular seaon a a player and into the manager s office  <BRK>bobby evans wa very open to whomever pablo recommended and it seems like this notion ha carried over a bit into the farhan era  <BRK>i ve spent a lot of word talking about who might be considered  but let s face it  we already know what the next manager will be  not a he or a she but a thing  specifically  an artificial intelligence that can run regression analysis in real time and acknowledges the inefficiency of emotion and going against programming parameter  that leaf only one choice <BRK>that s right  i m talking about a supercomputer housing the brain pattern of former hydra matermind arnim zola a seen in the movie captain america  the winter soldier   <BRK>     or something very much like it <BRK>think about it  a computer with the ability to crack a joke and approximate extemporaneous speech is all a modern baseball executive want  <BRK>now  obviously  this supercomputer won t look exactly like the one in winter soldier  it will be handsome  or  at least  the technological equivalent of handsome  or maybe rugged  like a crt tv on top of a flannel stand  you don t want a creepy hal   light or a silly looking knight rider interface  so they ll probably split the difference and use that somewhat creepy   somewhat silly this person doe not exist site that us ai to generate human face   here s a face that came up when i visited just now <BRK>let s call him al fakeman  he s easily a   or a   on the handsomeness scale  and if they just upload it to some sort of cartoon software  they can create inflection and articulation point around the mouth  connect the image to some speech software and voila  they ve got an on screen manager  cheap  young  ageless    and controllable <BRK>even though i ve just told you the ultimate winner  who do you still want to see a a candidate <BRK>
