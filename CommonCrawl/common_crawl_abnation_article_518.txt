  <BRK>asu will indeed be breaking in a new starting quarterback  but he ll have weapon around him  the running back corp appears well stocked despite the loss of warren wand  and the receiving corp feature two of the most efficient wideouts in the league in kirk merritt and omar bayless  a trio of juco transfer and some star freshman recruit should provide skill depth  the line still feature six player with   career start   the defense still return star like tackle kevin thurmon  safety darreon jackson  and linebacker tajhea chamber  too <BRK>you don t become the steadiest winner in your conference without generating layer of star talent  and asu s defense could improve enough to absorb a slight drop off from the offense  this program is sturdily built  even if said sturdiness will get a bit more of a test than normal this fall <BRK>anderson ha been his own play caller  so perhaps that make a coordinator transition easier  but it appears he s handing those duty to heckendorf <BRK>a former st  cloud state quarterback  heckendorf spent the last seven season with larry fedora  a former anderson bos  at north carolina  anderson first tried to bring him to town five year ago  you figure there won t be any massive stylistic change with heckendorf in charge of the o <BRK>that s good because the asu offense usually work pretty well   the red wolf have ranked in the off  s p  top   for four of anderson s five season <BRK>to make it five of six year  the red wolf need a quarterback  obviously  and i m not completely sure they have one <BRK>the likely starter is bonner  and it s hard to make too much of his stats because they were mostly in small sample against alabama    for     coastal carolina    for     and smu in      for     he might be just fine  but he hasn t necessarily proven it yet <BRK>you know what can do a new qb favor  efficiency weapon  merritt and bayless are tremendous in that regard  the senior to be combined to catch   of   pass    percent  for     yard and a   percent success rate  asu s quick passing game worked really well for hansen and could for bonner  too  and it would probably help further for heckendorf to continue anderson s against the grain play calling   the red wolf threw a lot on standard down   th in sd run rate  and ran a lot on passing down   th in pd run rate  <BRK>the depth is strong at receiver  too  eleven player were targeted at least   time last season  and eight return  that includes not only merritt and bayless but also big play weapon like jonathan adam jr     catch for   yard  and tight end javonis isaac    for     and while i expected more production from boise state transfer bubba ogbebor and oklahoma transfer dahu green  combined  they caught seven of   pass for   yard   they ve still got time <BRK>marcel murray s emergence built a bridge in the run game  wand wa expected to be au s top back  but murray came out of nowhere a a two star freshman  averaging     yard per carry and carrying the ball more than   time per game over the lat half of the seaon  he s back  and he ll likely get help from either juco transfer ryan graham  three star freshman isaiah azubuike and samy johnson  or both <BRK>despite leaning partially on a freshman running back  asu lost minimal ground in the run game  the red wolf were stuffed at or behind the line on just   percent of their non sack carry  sixth in fbs  that say very good thing about the line <BRK>losing bonner and guard marvis brown hurt  but center jacob still wa honorable mention all sun belt  four others started game last year  and tackle troy elliott started in    throw in two jucos  and you ve got enough quantity to make quality likely <BRK>a daily ish mini column on the college football thing of the day  with some other stuff too <BRK>not including the bowl game   an incredibly unlikely loss in which asu created nine scoring opportunity to nevada s four but somehow lost        arkansas state allowed     point per game in win and     in four regular season loss <BRK>the pas defense wa aggressive and efficient for most of the season  but if a team could run on the red wolf  they would run on them for   full minute  alabama  georgia southern  app state  and ul lafayette averaged   rush and   rushing yard per game <BRK>for better or worse  cauthen deployed a huge rotation up front  that might not have helped at the time  but it could help this year  a five player with at leat     tackle are gone but six return  and with kevin thurmon and forrest merrill in the middle  the new line coach ha some known play maker <BRK>it s all hand on deck at end  only one of those six returnees   william bradley king      tfls  six sack    is a non tackle  so some combination of senior t j  harris  junior noel iwuchukwu  and three juco transfer  kailon davis  aaron donkor  billy tuitavake  will have to produce <BRK>duggan is also from the fedora tree  he and anderson worked together under fedora at southern miss  and he served a southern miss dc from       he wa also head coach of nfl europe s cologne centurion  which is pretty badas   he s been a linebacker coach a much a anything  and it seems he s got a good one in junior tajhea chamber  who  after missing most of    broke through with   tackle and     tfls lat year <BRK>the secondary ha been a strength and should remain so <BRK>clifton s gone  a are corner brandon byner and safety michael johnson  but the red wolf still have safety darreon jackson and b j  edmonds  combined      tfls  eight pases defensed  and corner jerry jacob and jeremy smith  and it might not be a bad thing if junior safety demari medley got some more playing time  he wa on the field only long enough to make   tackle  but in that time he picked off two pases and broke up four more  and there are six three star freshman and sophomore in the chamber <BRK>asu wa all over the map in special team last year <BRK>grace and grupe are both back  and grupe s no longer a freshman  so that can t hurt <BRK>on paper  this team look like     arkansas state  the red wolf have produced an average s p  ranking of     in anderson s tenure  and they re projected  th this season  they have averaged     win per year with anderson  and their projected win total is     <BRK>if they have a merely decent quarterback  you could see how this might be a big year  asu play eight team projected  th or worse and is either a projected favorite or the slightest of underdog in   game  the trip to georgia might be out of reach  to put it politely  <BRK>off the field  thing are obviously trickier  the coaching attrition bug bit anderson and asu hard this offseason  and you just never know how a batch of new hire will go  it s a crapshoot   and this  of course  doesn t mention anderson s wife s battle  which trump any sort of  key   factor   list  <BRK>this season is the ultimate stability test for the arkansas state program  you could see thing playing out in a lot of different way  and it start right at the top of the schedule with tricky non conference game against smu and unlv <BRK>the steadiest team in the league is a mystery this year <BRK>all   preview
