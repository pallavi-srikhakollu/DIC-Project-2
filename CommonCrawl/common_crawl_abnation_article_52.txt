nick foles ha to be considered the best backup quarterback in the league at this point  and he s shown enough in that role that he could earn a job a a starting quarterback  in relief of carson wentz in the   seaon  foles guided the eagle to their first ever super bowl  this pat seaon  foles pushed the eagle to     down the stretch and into the playoff  where they won their wild card game against a tough bear team and had a spirited contest with the saint in the divisional round  <BRK>foles didn t have a great game against the saint  but the most pivotal play  an interception of his  wa on another player  a the pas went right through the hand of alshon jeffery  foles finished that game   of   for   yard  a touchdown and  technically  a pair of interception  <BRK>now that the season is over  foles is available for any team that need a quarterback in    <BRK>foles  deal with philadelphia wa set to escalate to a    million salary in    with both side having the ability to agree to it or part way  the eagle exercised that option  but foles declined it and will have to pay back a    million signing bonus  <BRK>that mean the only way the eagle could retain foles would be by placing the franchise tag on him  there were report that the team might try to do this earlier in the offseason  <BRK>adam schefter of espn reported that philadelphia would try to trade foles for a third round pick  potentially after retaining him with the franchise tag  that would add approximately      million to his salary in     the average of the top five salary at his position across the nfl  <BRK>it wouldn t have been the craziest thing for the eagle to franchise tag him and still keep him a wentz s backup in    a long a wentz is still on his rookie deal  that would still only add up to about    million of the eagle  salary cap going to quarterback   which is le than some quarterback get on their own  it would also give them the security of having a proven and stable backup quarterback  but with wentz expected to make a full recovery  the money could potentially be better spent elsewhere <BRK>in the end  the eagle decided not to tag foles  letting him become a free agent <BRK>pic twitter com fogqaauavr<BRK>let s take a look at where foles ha been  where he is and where he might be going <BRK>foles replaced carson wentz  who wa dealing with a back injury and is expected to be fine after some rest  in december  he led the eagle to three consecutive win to just barely make the postseason  in those three game  foles threw six touchdown against three interception while completing well over   percent of his pass <BRK>from the top   free agent  to mock draft  to scouting report  we ve got everything you need to get through the offseason  all in one place <BRK>that wa a marked improvement from foles  first two game of the season  before wentz made his   debut  foles threw just one touchdown and one interception with a     passer rating  that number jumped to     in his final three game of the regular season <BRK>he added another win in the playoff  this time against the bear  before falling to the saint  his postseason number dipped  though  in those two game  he completed     percent of his pas for   yard  three touchdown  and four interception  however  he led the eagle on a game winning drive against the bear and might have pulled off the same against the saint if jeffery hadn t dropped his pas <BRK>in    foles took over for wentz for the first time after the starter tore his acl in december  he went on to lead the eagle to three consecutive win before the playoff  there  he bested the falcon in the divisional round  the viking in the nfc championship and the patriot in the super bowl  earning super bowl mvp with three touchdown and   yard in the game <BRK>that s a pretty stellar recent history  <BRK>well  jeff fisher make fool of u all  doesn t he  in truth  foles wasn t particularly great in eight game for the eagle in    completing jut     percent of his pass for     yard    touchdown  and   interception   a clear regression from his     touchdown to interception ratio from    his breakout year <BRK>but it got worse in st  louis  where he completed just     percent of his pass for     yard  seven touchdown and   interception in   game with the ram  his play wa simply not good under fisher  and after such a harrowing experience  he wa considering retirement <BRK>yes  retirement  foles stepped away from the game and wa mulling his future when he got the opportunity to work with andy reid again on the chief  he came back to do just that  and said it wa entirely because of reid that he did  he didn t play much a a backup in kansa city  but his nfl career wa revitalized  leading to him re signing with the eagle in   <BRK>looking at his body of work a a whole  foles would appear to be one of the better veteran option likely to be available this offseaon  including guy like blake bortles  ryan tannehill   and teddy bridgewater  foles fall at no    on our top free agent list of    <BRK>in   career game  he s completed     percent of his pass for     yard    touchdown and   interception  he posted a completion percentage of     this past regular season <BRK>and  of course  you have the intangible  he play his best when the stake are high  an incredibly valuable trait for a starter  and one that is rare for a backup  he s been well liked in the locker room in philadelphia  and he s been durable throughout his career <BRK>the biggest concern  of course  is his lacking play in previous year  is he only going to be good with the eagle  or could he transition to another team and find success  that s the gamble  but he ll almost assuredly get a chance to start going forward <BRK>there are quite a few team around the league in need of a reliable quarterback  currently  the jacksonville jaguar  miami dolphin  and washington are a few starter needy team  with the jaguar likely being the favorite <BRK>it might be bittersweet for foles and the eagle to move on  but it s not unexpected  after their loss to the saint  foles sounded like he wa saying goodbye <BRK> no matter what happens it s been a joy being here every single day  being in this locker room  wearing this jersey  being a part of this city   foles said   we ll see what happens  <BRK> he ll always be remembered in philadelphia for bringing a super bowl to this city  so  a lot of great thing for him and we ve got these next few week  few month to make some tough decision  but we ll make them at that point   head coach doug pederson added  <BRK>but now  foles get a chance he s earned again  to be a team s no    quarterback  it look like the lucky team to pay for his service in   will indeed be the jaguar  he s expected to sign with the club   who will in turn release blake bortles   once free agency officially begin on march   <BRK><BRK>
