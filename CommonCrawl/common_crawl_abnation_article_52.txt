the dust is still very much up in the air following the  amicable divorce  between the dalla cowboy and scott linehan  a this is written  we still don t know who the offensive coordinator is  although kellen moore is asumed by many to be getting the job   jon kitna s hire a the new qb coach is still not official  and would indicate moore is getting some other position   and all we have about who is going to call play are hint and speculation  it is a lot of uncertainty and ambiguity  which is about par for the course under jerry jones  <BRK> one thing that is certain is that jaon garrett will continue a head coach this year  that is significant  since he will run the show  just how much he will be involved in the offense is another thing that is uncertain  and jones didn t do anything to clear that up on tuesday  <BRK> jerry  asked about jason garrett s involvement on offense   it could be more or le    cowboyswire <BRK> a for the offensive coordinator position  he did offer a pretty big hint  <BRK> asked specifically about outside candidate for offensive coordinator  jerry jones say   i like the guy we ve got in house    cowboyswire <BRK> that look like an indication that moore is indeed the heir apparent  but it also could mean that doug nussmeier is still in the running  or it could also mean that garrett could assume that job  with moore and or others in some kind of subordinate role  <BRK> but will that change the offense this fall  or are we doomed to more ezekiel elliott run into eight man box and predictable  easily defended play call   <BRK> that wa the question bob sturm asked in his eulogy for the scott linehan era in dallas at the athletic  is garrett committed to making real change  the article is behind a paywall  so i will sum up it conclusion  any error in interpreting sturm are on me   if garrett is willing to shift to an offensive approach more like that of high flying team like the los angeles ram  with lot of motion and formation that disguise the intent  then this could be the key to future success  if not  we probably will be debating who the new head coach is going to be before too long  <BRK> another question in all this is just what jerry jones  along with his son stephen  is telling garrett he is expected to do  are they making a more pas centric approach a requirement  or are they just going to trust in garrett to make thing work his way  <BRK> it is pretty clear that this season is all on garrett  last year wa on linehan  who is perceived to have gotten his way in the   shakeup of the coaching staff  he failed to deliver  and is gone  now the buck is on garrett s desk  if the offensive woe continue  he cannot be retained  <BRK> jerry jones ha talked about an extension for garrett  but some  such a bryan broaddus of dallacowboys com  have advocated letting him coach out the final year of his current deal to hold his foot to the fire  allow me to offer an objection to that  i am not sure that will really motivate garrett particularly  he want to win  no matter his perceived job security  after all  a coach s contract just amount to how much money he is paid if his employment is terminated  and jones ha money to burn  so extending garrett ha little effect on his longevity in dalla  <BRK> besides  jones ha stated that garrett would get five job offer if he hit the market  in this case  that is not hyperbole  garrett is the man who resurrected the franchise  he came into a dysfunctional franchise and established a culture while having a large hand in the building of what is now a young and talented roster  this wa all while working with the most hand on owner and general manager in the league  the other owner know who jones is and what he is like to deal with  any owner trying to turn his own team around would have to be interested in someone like garrett who can accomplish what he ha under those condition  while there is certainly still some dysfunction at the star  there is a demonstrable ability of the top management to mostly work together in harmony  all while garrett ha established a locker room that is fully on board with his goal and objective  <BRK> garrett might even be an attractive candidate to be a general manager  because his greatest strength seem to be in organization and getting a bunch of big ego on a coaching staff to work together  it is arguable that linehan s biggest problem wa that he wa the one stubbornly fighting against the current on the cowboy  staff  i don t know if garrett would entertain that idea  since his heart and soul seem to be in coaching  but i don t doubt he be a very good gm  <BRK> another thing that ha emerged from the coaching move and rumor is that this is designed to make the most of dak prescott  it is notable that four of the coach that will be involved in the offense  however the job title and role shake out  are former quarterback  garrett  moore  nussmeier  and kitna  three of them played for dallas  this look like the team going all in to give prescott all the support he can get to make him the quarterback to lead this team to the promised land  <BRK> that is something that may pay dividend no matter how garrett chooses to change or stand pat on the offensive philosophy  just getting prescott to a higher level of performance could be enough to make the difference no matter how many failed run are called in a game  the team ha already taken step to help him with the receiver he ha to work with  a amari cooper and michael gallup look to be a potent one two punch  sort out the slot receiver position  add some more talent at tight end while continuing to develop blake jarwin and dalton schultz  and the offensive output may increae even if nothing really change in the game plan and pay calling  <BRK> but put me down a one who think there will be change  they may be fairly wholesale  or more incremental  this may be a bad asumption  but if there is one lesson that should have been learned from lat year  it is that lining up your guy against their guy and beating them on the line despite showing them exactly what you intend is not the way to win  just change that apect  and thing should get better   perhaps much better  <BRK> maybe this show too much faith in garrett  but now the first big step ha been taken  and we will soon see some other thing clear up  we will at least know who ha what title  and some idea of what their role is  <BRK> from listening to jerry jones  it sound like the cowboy plan to head to orlando tomorrow  meet with their coach and talk to their player and figure out how to structure their staff  cowboywire <BRK> the one thing we will probably have to wait on is who will actually call the play  <BRK> play calling is something you normally experiment with and work out in the preseason game  from experience we probably won t know anything solid until then  <BRK> the offseason is sometimes a slow time for nfl fan  but so far  it ha been pretty exciting for those of u who follow the cowboy  more is definitely coming  we will be here to keep you up to date on it all  <BRK>  <BRK>
