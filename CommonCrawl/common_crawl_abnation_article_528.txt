it s been a turbulent season for william nylander  a protracted contract negotiation saw him miss the first two month of the season  with fan and medium member taking turn to criticize his character and value to the leaf  when he returned  he entered the worst slump of his young career from a scoring perspective  and wa predictably rusty  which only compounded the criticism   <BRK> however  a we would expect  nylander didn t suddenly forget how to play hockey over the offseaon  he got back up to speed and ha been a noticeably improved player in many apects when compared to lat year  since december  th  the day of his first game back   his      cf rel  rank second among leaf forward  andrea johnsson is first   if you look at more complicated stats  he look even better  nylander s impact on shot generation stack up with some of the very best player in the league   <BRK> one stat i like to use to as this is called regularized adjusted plus minus  rapm   which can be found at evolving hockey com  rapm is an all in one number that meaure how a player drive play  the detail of how to calculate rapm are in the link above  but the short version is that it is a meaure that estimate a player s impact on a play driving metric  such a goal generation  shot generation  shot suppression  expected goal generation  or expected goal suppression  accounting for their teammate  their competition  their score usage  and their zone usage  it is not a perfect encapsulation of a player s play driving ability  but in my opinion  it is one of the best publicly available stats out there at accounting for usage and asing which player tilt the ice in their team s favour  below  i ve plotted the density  essentially  the frequency  of player  impact  on a rate bais  on shot generation for  cf    expected goal generation for  xgf    shot differential  cd   and expected goal differential  xgf    a calculated by rapm  highlighting where nylander stand relative to the league  the x ax in this cae represent the impact provided in each stat relative to an average player  per   minute  <BRK> we should keep in mind that these estimate of player impact are jut that   estimate  there are invisible error bar around each of those blue vertical line  which can be significant  nonetheless  i think that we d all agree that these result make sense to u  nylander is an outstanding paser and transition player  so it make sense that his impact on shot generation are well above average  which drive his excellent shot and expected goal differential on the whole  he grade out a average defensively by these meaures  not pictured  which also make intuitive sense  these play driving number have nylander knocking on the door of the truly elite player in the league  which is to say  from the perspective of tilting the ice in his team s favour  it s hard to ak any more of nylander   <BRK> however  the elephant in the room is that play driving  while a critical part of hockey  is not the target  the target is scoring goal  and unfortunately for nylander  the leaf haven t done a lot of that when he s been on the ice  the leaf score     gf   at  v  with nylander on the ice  putting him seventh among leaf forward  a you would expect given his elite play driving number  this is primarily the result of a low personal and on ice shooting percentage  the leaf a a whole shoot just    at  v  with nylander on the ice  per natural stat trick   which is not terribly far from the league average  but is notably below the team average  furthermore  nylander himself ha only shot      at  v  this year  beating only connor brown and the since departed par lindholm among leaf forward  per moneypuck  nylander s  v  goal per minute is only    of his expected goal per minute  this mean that accounting for shot quality  a shot taken by nylander this year is le than half a likely to go in than if it wa taken by an average forward  <BRK> the common refrain is that he is likely to see his shooting percentage bounce upwards  and that he s too talented to shoot    forever  that is almost certainly true  one of the most important and fundamental discovery in the early day of hockey analytics wa understanding just how volatile shooting percentage can be  and that the vast majority of player fit into a narrow band of shooting performance  outlying result like this are not likely to persist long term  <BRK> however  the troubling aspect is that this is the third straight year that nylander ha underperformed his expected shooting percentage  at some point  we have to stop expecting his shooting to revert  and consider the possibility that he s simply not an effective shooter  while his shot seems good superficially  he ha at time struggled with getting it on net  over the course of his career  just    of nylander s shot attempt have ended up on target  with the league median for forward in that time being     even when his shot make it on target  only      of them go in  compared to the league median of       at a certain point  the eye test take a back seat to three year of shooting data  <BRK> from the leaf perspective  this is problematic in that his upside is capped  it s hard to become an elite point scorer while being a below average shooter  that nylander is still  rd league wide in  v  p   since his rookie year despite this is a testament to his elite passing and the fact that he ha shared the ice with the best  v  goal scorer on the planet  furthermore  nylander won t drive goal to the same degree that other elite offensive player do  despite his ability to drive shot and expected goal  simply because he doesn t convert his chance at a high enough rate   <BRK> the leaf have a partial remedy to this  which is to keep him tethered to auston matthew  matthew is one of the best shooter in the league  covering for nylander s weakness in converting chance  and nylander  a one of the best play driver in the league  help matthew spend more time in the offensive zone  where he s at his best  matthew is one of those special player who will always be better than their play driving metric say they are  every game  we have more and more evidence that nylander is the opposite  <BRK> this is a real tragedy  because nylander s offensive game outside of his shooting is elite  he ha the potential to be one of the very best offensive player in the world  given his transition ability and pasing  manual tracking data suggests that nylander is among the league leader in creating shot for both himself and teammate  a well a creating zone entry  if he wa an average shooter  his  v  scoring over the pat three year would be similar to nickla backstrom s   another swedish pas first player who is the second banana to an elite goal scorer  backstrom will probably end up in the hall of fame  the main thing separating he and nylander s  v  scoring over the lat few year is shooting percentage   <BRK> if you re looking for some indication that nylander s shooting is salvageable  the man to look at is nathan mackinnon  through his first four year  mackinnon s shooting percentage wa       and there wa discussion over why such a can t miss prospect wa not producing the way we would expect  over the lat two  his shooting percentage is       and suddenly  mackinnon is a consensus top   forward in the world  it s also not a if mackinnon s expected shooting percentage dratically shot upwards either  it s higher in the lat two year than in the previous three  but only by     percentage point  furthermore  his expected shooting percentage is lower than nylander s ha been across his entire career  one of the most annoying myth about nylander is that he s a perimeter player who take low percentage shot   some time in the lat few year  whether by a change in his game or random variance  mackinnon figured out how to shoot  and changed from a frustrating young player with potential to an elite offensive player  it s not out of the realm of possibility that nylander can do the same  <BRK> if i ran the leaf  i d be doing everything in my power to figure out why nylander s shooting ha produced such poor result  and what  if anything  can be done to fix it  he s a brilliant player already  but if this  potentially  low hanging fruit is plucked  he becomes a world beater  more generally  a team that is able to coax out a percentage point or two out of a player s shooting percentage would be unlocking a masive competitive advantage  player who can sustainably convert a high proportion of their shot to goal are unbelievably valuable in a league a tight a the nhl  if i were running an analytics department  it d certainly be one of my area of intense investment  the leaf are fortunate enough to have two elite shooter already in matthew and john tavares  their goal this offseaon should be to try and see if there s a way to internally develop another  <BRK> rapm data is from evolving hockey com  and includes all even strength data <BRK> all other information is from natural stat trick  naturalstattrick com  or moneypuck  moneypuck com  <BRK> stats are current up to march   <BRK>
