if you think about it  the pittsburgh steelers   regular season resembles the career arc of antonio brown in pittsburgh  <BRK> this isn t to suggest antonio brown doen t still have good football left in him   trust me  he doe  but if you are the general manager owner head coach of an nfl team  and you want to add brown to your roster  you might want to do your homework before pulling the trigger on a deal  <BRK> for the time being  let s just keep the off field distraction interaction out of the equation  i ll get there  but i wanted to talk about the on field aspect of acquiring brown first  <BRK> in my opinion  brown is a generational talent at the wide receiver position  but it also should be noted he fell right into the perfect situation while with the steelers  brown and ben roethlisberger spent countless hour  over several year  working on their connection  and to think this can just be duplicated elsewhere is a very poor decision  <BRK> when roethlisberger missed time  even when quarterback who were in the steelers  system took over  do you know how many touchdown pass brown caught  <BRK> zero  <BRK> that s right  antonio brown ha never caught a touchdown pas from someone other than ben roethlisberger in his entire career  <BRK> i found this to be astonishing  considering the amount of time roethlisberger ha missed on several occasion  but it make you wonder if brown would be able to just pick up where he left off with roethlisberger if when he find a new football home  <BRK> roethlisberger helped make brown  and brown helped make roethlisberger  on occasion to a fault  but no one really know what brown will do without roethlisberger  meanwhile  roethlisberger ha helped several wide receiver become better player overall  some eventually hitting a big pay day after leaving pittsburgh  <BRK> emmanuel sandersmike wallacenate washingtonantwaan randle elcedrick wilsonjerricho cotcherysantonio holmes <BRK> the list could go on  but the fact remains that if i m a general manager for another team  i m wondering what brown s attitude is going to be if he doesn t have the immediate success with the quarterback currently on their roster  <BRK> this then brings up the topic of behavior both on and off the field  throughout brown s career  his demeanor towards thing possibly not going his way ha gotten worse  it isn t always noticeable  and the camera aren t always catching it  but the time he threw the gatorade jug on the sideline in baltimore wa just one example  <BRK> brown usually is able to keep his cool  but that is often because he know football will be thrown his way  this past year he didn t have the astonishing reception number he had in   or    but what he did do in   wa set a new career mark for touchdown reception in a season  with    when you are putting up touchdown at that rate  you tolerate some comment  trend and attitude which might not completely jive with what you really want   <BRK> antonio brown is your typical star wide receiver in the nfl  i hate to use the term  diva  when talking about receiver  but he realizes his skill level  he know how he can help his team  but he also want what is best for him  what is best for his brand  and that would be none other than getting a ton of pass thrown his way on a weekly basis   <BRK> period  <BRK> could antonio brown go to another team and be a effective a he wa in pittsburgh  absolutely  but the one caveat here is he isn t a free agent  he isn t facing the choice of picking between going to the green bay packer and aaron rodger  or the san francisco  er with jimmy garoppolo  no  he go where the steeler tell him he is going  and this should scare the pant off of brown  <BRK> imagine if the steelers pull a trade off with the arizona cardinal  think brown would be okay with the learning curve of second year quarterback josh rosen  the same could be said with sam darnold and the new york jet or josh allen with the buffalo bill  <BRK> brown ha had it good in pittsburgh  and if when he realizes the grass isn t always greener on the other side of the fence  his action behavior might have the team who pay handsomely for his service left with some buyer s remorse over the deal  <BRK>
