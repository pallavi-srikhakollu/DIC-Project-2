sunday s conference championship game were exhilarating  the ram and patriot advanced to super bowl   thanks to a combination of excellence  creativity  and perseverance  <BRK> but mostly  they just did a better job diving into the muck and coming out cleaner than their opponent on an entirely sloppy day of football  the afc and nfc title game featured several turnover  drop  and botched call that swung the momentum of each game and ultimately told the world we were running   s title game back to   and giving the ram another shot at tom brady and bill belichick  <BRK> this year s conference championship game saw brain wrinkling mistake from star like tom brady  todd gurley  and tyreek hill a each of the league s final four team   with the arguable exception of the saint   seemed hell bent of proving they could overcome their own brain fart and make it to the super bowl  even more amazingly  new england and los angeles did  so which mistake were the worst from a legendary sunday of playoff football  <BRK> tyreek hill is an electric playmaker and the best returner the chief have had since dante hall roamed the sideline at arrowhead stadium  and when his team needed a spark to mount a comeback against the patriot  he decided to put his unmatched speed to the test and eschew a modest gain in exchange for the slim chance of a highlight reel punt return that would leave the patriot dumbfounded and ignite the crowd at arrowhead stadium  <BRK> this wa an awful bet  new england had the angled kick well covered  and hill had no where to go  the end result     yard  <BRK> the chief  drive stalled out from there  and the resulting short field new england got following a dustin colquitt punt allowed the patriot to kick a field goal   a vital three point in a game where every inch counted  <BRK> patrick mahomes is probably going to be named the nfl mvp for the   season  and that s largely due to his ability to extend play and make difficult throw outside the pocket  <BRK> but running backward to escape a sack can backfire and it did early for the chief  mahomes wa sacked three time in the first half and each wa for a loss of at leat   yard  the second sack came at an especially inopportune time  a it knocked kansa city out of field goal range  <BRK> huge sack by trey flower to take kc out of fg range   gopats pic twitter com cc fiafmg  <BRK> an incomplete pas would ve set up the chief with a field goal of about   yard  instead the sack turned it into a   yard try  on a cold day at arrowhead stadium  andy reid opted for a punt instead  <BRK> gurley had been a beast in his first two postseason game  running for    yard in each of them and generally looking like an all pro tailback in the process  but on sunday  he only earned four carry and three target  and that     might have been the right move  <BRK> with the exception of a   yard touchdown run late in the second quarter  gurley s play on the field topped out at  forgettable  and occasionally sank into  awful   he got trapped behind the line of scrimmage on rush  missed his assignment when called to pas block  and dropped two pases   one of which led to three saint point in the first quarter  <BRK> gurley wound up playing le than c j  anderson in the nfc championship game  but he s owning his own craptitude  <BRK> todd gurley to  josinaanderson   i didn t play good  i didn t deserve to be in there  cj wa in there  he did his thing  everybody held me down  we all held each other  and we just got it done  we just got it done  thank you lord  thank you   <BRK> los angeles had bent but not broken early  snuffing out a pair of new orleans scoring drive and holding the saint to a pair of field goal to keep the ram in this game early  that resolve faded on drew brees  third drive of the game  first came a fourth and   encroachment penalty that turned what could have been a momentum killing stop or timeout burning reset into a free set of down when michael brockers fell for new orleans  hard count  <BRK> michael brockers  you big dummy  one play later  the saint turned this free first down into a five yard td pas pic twitter com gm pwuzpfd <BRK> thing got worse from there  the veteran quarterback dialed up a play for third string tight end garrett griffin  who ran free in the end zone for just his second nfl catch to put the home team up      and how did he get so open  because former all pro marcus peter delivered a gorgeous pick     of his own teammate  <BRK> the ram just ran a pick    on themselves pic twitter com s dmwtokl <BRK> that put the ram in a     hole     which ultimately made their comeback all the more epic  <BRK> huge sack by trey flower to take kc out of fg range   gopats pic twitter com cc fiafmg  <BRK> new england had a chance to silence the raucous arrowhead stadium crowd early after taking a     lead and then driving to the kansa city   yard line with it second drive of the evening  the chief desperately needed a stop to keep from getting demoralized in the first quarter of their first ever home game at the afc championship  and they got one   all thanks to an awful throw by tom brady  <BRK> end zone pick  reggieragland pic twitter com kxfyb ug n <BRK> the patriot tried to outthink kansa city  only to wind up caught in a trap of their own making instead  rob gronkowski hadn t slipped through the line unattended after a play fake to sony michel  he wa heavily covered by justin houston  and a he darted to the back of the end zone  reggie ragland dropped back to follow him  brady  never outwardly considering any other option  forced a pas into coverage anyway  only for ragland to erae new england s scoring opportunity and energize a crowd just waiting for a big play to erupt  <BRK> last week  dee ford wa a monster against the colt and looked like he could be their secret weapon to making the super bowl   <BRK> wellll  he helped one team get there  but it wasn t the chief  <BRK> with just under a minute to go and the patriot trailing by four  tom brady s pas to rob gronkowski slipped right through the tight end s hand and into the waiting arm of chief cornerback charvarius ward   <BRK> it would ve been game over  hello super bowl  but there wa a flag   ford had lined up in the neutral zone  <BRK> you didn t have to be tony romo   or even stephen a  smith    to know what wa about to happen  two play later  the patriot scored a touchdown  patrick mahomes helped the chief tie it up to send the game to overtime  but then he never saw the ball again   <BRK> and for the fourth time in five year  it s the patriot headed to the super bowl  <BRK> an emotional ford took the blame after the game  and andy reid agreed with the call  but what a gutpunch for the chief  <BRK> the second half of patriot chief appeared to go on interminably thanks to an array of replay challenge and call where all that separated a turnover or a drop from a tide turning play wa a unit of width imperceptible to the human eye  that s not especially problematic  <BRK> but there were still issue  tom brady earned a borderline roughing the passer call on a non hit that wa nearly identical to a play where patrick mahomes hadn t drawn a flag minute before   <BRK> please send tom brady your prayer after this violent roughing the passer penalty pic twitter com  zt s tko  <BRK> there were also a handful of iffy spot  kinda sorta pas interference call  and non call   and a wide range of stoppage just to remind the viewer at home that the game clock wa correct  those call were excusable and  for the most part  had little to no impact on the final outcome of the game  the nfc title game  though  ho ho ho ho hoooolly shit  <BRK> that s tommylee lewis getting three year of tap dancing lesson eraed from his brain on a helmet to helmet hit from nickell robey coleman well before drew brees  third and   pa could even get to him  and while a catch may not have ensured the new set of down that would have allowed new orleans to salt the clock away and kick a game winning field goal a time round down  the pa interference call robey coleman s hit clearly constituted certainly would have  <BRK> instead  no flag  fourth down  lewis wa shocked  head coach sean payton wa shocked  robey coleman  even  wa shocked  <BRK> he hadn t seen it  so i showed nickell robey coleman the replay of his hit on tommylee lewis   oh  hell yeah   he said   that wa pi   while admitting that  he also gave a fascinating  entirely convincing breakdown of why and how it wa a smart play  <BRK> instead  the saint kicked their field goal and gave the ball back to the ram  who kicked an equalizer of their own  sent the game into overtime  and drilled a   yard kick to advance to super bowl    thanks  in no small part  to a completely botched no call on clear pas interference  <BRK>
