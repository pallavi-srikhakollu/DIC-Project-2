the uc irvine anteater are through to the ncaa tournament s round of    and that s le of a surprise than their no    seeding in the south region would indicate  <BRK>irvine beat no    kansa state friday in san jose       by following the same formula that delivered the anteater to a     record and big west championship  stingy on ball defense that encourages the opponent to miss a lot of shot  <BRK>this is wa one of my favorite upset pick before the tournament   in part because of irvine s defense  in part because k state ha struggled to shoot well all year  and in part because irvine had just been really hot over the last few month  <BRK>irvine seems to me like the best upset pick beyond the  th seed  the anteater haven t lost since jan     and while you could fairly point out that they haven t played anyone of note  i could in turn point out that kansa state ha a lousy offense and doesn t make a lot of shot  irvine s a decent shooting team  and if the anteater get hot  it doesn t take much imagination to see a bad k state shooting game leading the wildcat to big problem <BRK>the betting public liked irvine  too  according to the william hill sportsbook    percent of total ticket were on the anteater  who were around     point underdog  <BRK>kansa state wa a bad shooting team  the wildcat entered  st in division i in effective field goal percentage  a metric that weighs three pointer a   percent more valuable than two  bruce weber s team didn t have a single standout shooter  which left the wildcat obviously vulnerable against the nation s best two point defense by field goal percentage  <BRK>meanwhile  the anteater  defense entered at no    in the same stat  <BRK>sure enough  k state shot     percent from the field and     percent from three  <BRK>the key is the anteater  defense  <BRK>how the rest of the west shake out is unclear  but the region is loaded with team that don t shoot the rock that well  their next opponent will be either no    wisconsin or no    oregon  neither of which is better than  th in di in efg   if they can win that game  they might face virginia  whose shooting  and various other  problem in march have been documented more meticulously than any other program in the sport s  or maybe it ll face oklahoma  which sits  th in efg   whoever it is won t be an elite shooting team  <BRK>irvine is going to be smaller than the team it face the rest of the way  which might make it susceptible to a lot of offensive rebound  the defense rarely force turnover  but it s great at causing opponent to miss shot  and the team hanging nearby in the west are not especially good at making them  that s why it wasn t a surprise to see irvine beat a nominally superior k state  and why it shouldn t be a surprise if the run isn t over  <BRK>guard evan leonard  who stand      wa the star against k state  scoring   point on just seven shot from the field  thanks to a   for   showing at the foul line  <BRK>fellow guard max hazzard and robert cartwright are generally efficient scorer  hazzard in particular  both of them shot a lot of brick against k state  a they went a combined   for   from the field for   point  fortunately  all five of hazzard s make  on   shot  were triple  but both of them can be better than they were in the first round  <BRK>don t be at all surprised if this team play in the sweet   or elite eight <BRK>
