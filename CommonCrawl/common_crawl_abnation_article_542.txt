teddy bridgewater is arguably the most fascinating name among all free agent this year  bridgewater is a former first round quarterback with playoff experience   and he s just   year old  those type of quarterback don t typically hit the free agent market   <BRK> if your team is one of the few that need a starting quarterback this offseaon  and it isn t a fan of the upcoming draft clas  bridgewater make sense a an option  <BRK> of course  the caveat with bridgewater is the horrible knee injury that he suffered right before the start of the   season  he missed all of   and returned in the middle of the   season  but he threw just two pass in relief of case keenum that year  after the   season  bridgewater hit free agency and signed a one year deal with the jet   <BRK> he put together a productive preseason  to the point that people were suggesting he start in place of sam darnold  the jet  first round pick that spring  he had a lot of play that looked like vintage bridgewater  <BRK> teddy bridgewater avoids the rush and convert the first down pic twitter com yu fzkbmes <BRK> he wa then traded to the saint  where he sat behind drew brees for the season before starting a week   game against the carolina panther  <BRK> there are still question regarding the long term viability of bridgewater  he s thrown just   pas in the pat three year  but he s an intriguing prospect who might have some value a a starter in    bridgewater could be a hot commodity now that joe flacco is off the market  and nick foles is the lat  big  free agent at quarterback   <BRK> here are five team to keep an eye on for bridgewater s service when the new league year begin on march     <BRK> one option for bridgewater would be to return to the saint  if bridgewater walk in free agency  then the saint wouldn t really have a legitimate backup quarterback on their roster  taysom hill ha been a fun offensive weapon for the saint over the pat two seaon  but if they really valued his ability a a quarterback  they wouldn t put him on kickoff and punt return  <BRK> new orleans need to start looking for a brees replacement a well  brees just turned   year old and started to look it after the saint  thanksgiving game against the falcon  in brees  final four game of the regular seaon  he threw just three touchdown to three interception and averaged only     yard per game   <BRK> the biggest problem with a bridgewater reunion would be the amount of money he s owed  it s not that bridgewater would break the bank with a new contract  it s more that the saint are a bit cash strapped right now  <BRK> new orleans is currently projected to have just      million in cap space   even a backup quarterback contract would put a dent in that  last year  the saint had to get a little creative with bridgewater s deal to make sure they still had enough space in case they needed to sign free agent during the season  <BRK> brees  whose current cap hit is a massive      million  might have to rework his contract again to free up some immediate cap space for the team  if the saint can work some magic  bringing back bridgewater for another year could be beneficial to both side   <BRK> the jaguar  quarterback situation is a hot mess  they appear ready to move on from blake bortles and his comically bad contract that come with      million of dead cap if  or when  he s cut  even if they release bortles  the jaguar will still have negative cap space to work with for the   season   though they have some obvious cut candidate on the team  <BRK> nick foles would probably make the most sense a a bridge quarterback given his tie to newly hired offensive coordinator john defilippo  who wa the eagle  quarterback coach during their super bowl run  there are also report that say foles will sign with jacksonville right when the new league year begin   <BRK> if that doesn t happen  then bringing bridgewater in a a stabilizing force would make sense  jacksonville could rebuild it quarterback room with bridgewater and a high first round pick   the team is still showing some interest in bridgewater  <BRK> interesting note   adamschefter just reported that  jaguar are also interested in fa qb teddy bridgewater and that nick foles isn t a done deal just yet   sport jax <BRK> cincinnati is a team to keep an eye on during the offseaon s quarterback carousel  the bengal hired ram quarterback coach zac taylor a their head coach  and he might want to put his own mark on the quarterback room  the bengal moving on from andy dalton wouldn t give them any dead cap  so it s eay to see a situation where taylor would want to bring in his own guy  <BRK> the only other quarterback under contract is backup jeff driskel  who ended up starting five game for the bengal when dalton wa injured  cincinnati went     with driskel a the starter  and he only threw for     yard per attempt in those five game  that mark wa even worse than josh rosen s     yard per attempt  which wa the lowest in the league among qualified pasers  <BRK> bridgewater could be a nice veteran fit for the bengal if they part with dalton and don t want to spend the draft capital to move up and select a rookie quarterback  <BRK> cincinnati s offense isn t completely bereft of talent  either  a j  green  tyler boyd  and joe mixon will be returning to the offense  if taylor is a decent playcaller for the bengal  this is an offense that should be able to stay afloat and not be a complete disaster with  competent quarterback play   <BRK> the giant are in a transitioning phase at the quarterback position  eli manning  whose agent expects him to be back with the team  just turned   year old and obviously isn t the future in new york anymore   <BRK> bridgewater might not be the long term answer either  but he could be worth the dice roll for new york  the giant already have an elite skill position duo with odell beckham jr  and saquon barkley and can t really afford to waste season of their prime  bridgewater may not be the answer that the giant are looking for  but a different body at quarterback might be what the giant need  <BRK> in the scenario where the giant do sign bridgewater  they would likely move on from manning  cutting manning would free up about    million in cap space for the giant to use in free agency   <BRK> the giant are expected to draft a quarterback in the first round  whether they stay at no    in the order or move up  bridgewater could be a cheaper and younger bridge quarterback than manning for the giant  who wouldn t have to start a rookie right away  <BRK>
