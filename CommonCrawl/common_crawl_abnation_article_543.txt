relative to expectation  the miami hurricane had one of the worst  s of any program in college football  having the most talented roster in the damp acc coastal did not prevent the cane from going      capped by an ugly pinstripe bowl loss to wisconsin s backup quarterback  <BRK> any qb might not work out  but it s not an indictment of martell that he didn t beat out barrett  a a freshman  or hakins  during the starter s heisman finalist year  at osu  or that the buckeye wanted to pick up georgia transfer justin field  the no    qb recruit of the recruiting ranking era  martell could turn out to be a great player for miami   <BRK> let me know if i m missing something in there  it s a lot to keep up with   <BRK> this happened over the course of two and a half week  and these are supposed to be some of the quieter week of the year  <BRK> if the answer to those question are yes and no  in that order  then you are not having a better start to   than miami  in my opinion   <BRK>  i will also hear argument for north dakota state having a better   so far than miami  but for the bison  winning the fcs title is like going to the grocery store  it s basically a chore at this point    <BRK> my one reservation is that the rock is still not on diaz s staff   <BRK>
