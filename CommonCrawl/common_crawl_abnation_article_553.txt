the point total for super bowl   ha been installed a the second highest of all time  which mean we can probably asume there will be a decent amount of scoring  even if we get an unexpected defensive contest  we re all but certain to have at leat one touchdown  no super bowl ha ever gone without a touchdown  and the nfl s offensive evolution suggests that won t change anytime soon barring a wild quirk <BRK>naturally  you can bet on who will score the first touchdown of the game  if you think this is finally the year we don t see a touchdown  the folk at the westgate superbook in la vega are willing to give you       odds on this particular prop bet  sure  it mean a big pay day if it happens  but in reality it s a sucker bet <BRK>whereas tom brady and jared goff have the best odds to win super bowl mvp  they have some of the longest odds when it come to scoring the first touchdown  this is about who get into the end zone  so a quarterback passing to a wide receiver mean the wide receiver count for the score  that mean goff and brady s best hope to win this bet are either a scramble down inside the    or maybe a version of philly special <BRK>the running back are the favorite in this wager  with sony michel leading the way at      followed by todd gurley        c j  anderson        and james white        defensive player are slotted in under  field  which is sitting at      it s not much of a value play given the unlikelihood of player not included on the list below <BRK>gurley lead the ram with   touchdown  he ha one touchdown each of the team s two playoff game  but his usage wa questionable in the nfc title game  robert wood is next on the list for the ram with seven touchdown  the best value might be c j  anderson  who only ha four touchdown this season for the ram  but had two against dallas and got more work than gurley in the nfc title game <BRK>over the course of   game between the regular season and postseason  the patriot have scored   touchdown  and the ram have scored   touchdown  white lead the patriot with   touchdown  while sony michel s five postseason touchdown shot him up to   total on the season  it hasn t been particularly close after that  with julian edelman currently at six touchdown on the season <BRK>the best sleeper value for either team is rex burkhead at      he missed half the season  and did not score his first touchdown until week    however  including that game  he ha scored in three straight game  with three in the playoff  add in a bad ram run defense  and you probably won t find a better sleeper for this kind of prop bet <BRK>here is a full rundown of  player to score first touchdown  odds  via the westgate superbook <BRK>sony michel     julian edelman     james white     rob gronkowski     chris hogan     phillip dorsett     rex burkhead     cordarrelle patterson     tom brady     <BRK>todd gurley     c j  anderson     brandin cook     robert wood     josh reynolds     gerald everett     tyler higbee     jared goff     jojo natson     <BRK>field     no touchdown scored     <BRK>
