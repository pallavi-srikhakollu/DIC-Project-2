the nba is returning it all star game to north carolina this weekend  marking the conclusion to it caving on an lgbtq issue it once championed  <BRK> you may remember that when north carolina state legislator passed the anti lgbtq hb   and it wa signed by the governor  the nba pulled it all star game out of charlotte and awarded it to new orleans  when roy cooper wa elected governor  he patched together a  fix  that wa anything but a repeal  mandating discrimination against the lgbtq community until at least   and continuing to put transgender people in a predicament when using public facility   <BRK> yet the nba went racing back to north carolina  and the league will host it all star game there this weekend  <BRK> a i wrote a couple year ago  the list of lgbt community leader and organization opposing this move includes    all of them  <BRK> the move reflects what we ve complained about over and over  that league and team like to wave rainbow flag and sell ticket  but they are not actually committed to advancing equality  that the league turned it back on the lgbtq community so clearly and quickly reflects that lack of real commitment   <BRK> the league ha dozen of other location it could have considered for the all star game  yet adam silver and the rest of the league just couldn t wait to reward charlotte and north carolina despite codified mandated anti lgbtq discrimination   <BRK> yes  the league ha done a lot of rainbow flag waving over the last couple of year  marching in new york s pride march  hosting pride night and other effort  yet seeing the all star game in charlotte this weekend is a real slap in the face of the entire lgbtq community   <BRK>
