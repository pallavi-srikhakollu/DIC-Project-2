inside the ncaa s year long  twisting investigation into mississippi football<BRK>by steven godfrey<BRK>no matter what else happens  remember the t shirt <BRK>it s easy for them to get lost in this whole saga  there are overwhelming distraction to come  but don t forget about the t shirt  because nothing else will matter when we re done <BRK>not the social medium hack that put image of a college football star wearing a gas mask bong on the internet just moment before the   nfl draft <BRK>not the football coach  the pious one who quoted scripture and made football miracle happen  who found himself undone by a sex scandal <BRK>and not the money  that might be the hardest part  there s money everywhere in this story  including the stack of cash mississippi state linebacker leo lewis  said he took from multiple party trying to sway him to play football for their team  there are also the untold dollar paid to college football player every year against ncaa rule  and the million in legal fee spent to parse the former <BRK>at time this story bend to the wildly unbelievable and entertaining  yet nothing about the great ole miss football scandal ha changed college football  verdict have been rendered and penalty enforced  none of which will amount to any measurable change to the system  program are still cheating  coach are still claiming they don t know it  and the gross economic inequity between those who manage college football s business model and those who fuel it is still intact <BRK>but  the t shirt  they might make this time different <BRK>in a hotel conference room on an august morning in    in front of the lawyer his university hired to represent him  leo lewis talked to an ncaa investigator  he told them that on one occaion he wa gifted with what he estimated to be    worth of merchandise   an impermissible benefit under ncaa rule   at an oxford  mississippi  store called rebel rag  he made these claim a part of a deal that promised him immunity from penalty <BRK>lewis said there were some t shirt  baseball jersey  and some other  stuff   he told ncaa investigator mike sheridan  he didn t even keep the free ole miss clothes  why would he  he play linebacker for mississippi state  their archrival  some of the item he couldn t even remember well enough to describe <BRK>those t shirt  though  not only changed lewis  life  but potentially have opened the ncaa s warped justice system to real legal standard  with real legal ramification for the institution itself <BRK>so no matter what else happens  don t forget the t shirt  a lot of people cheat in this story  and more lie  don t get distracted <BRK>illustration by josh schielie<BRK>no one actually considered former ole miss football coach houston nutt  a mastermind of anything  good or bad <BRK>no one actually considered former ole miss football coach houston nutt  a mastermind of anything  good or bad <BRK>in    a once average ole miss rebel football program hit rock bottom under then head coach nutt  going     over two season and winless in sec conference play that year <BRK>nutt s four year tenure in oxford  the small town where the university of mississippi is located  wa  and still is  characterized by former ole miss staffer and rival coach a not organized enough to be devious <BRK>when ncaa enforcement  the  cop  who investigate alleged rule breaking in college sport  first came to ole miss  they showed up to investigate the woman s basketball and track and field program  no one outside the ncaa know exactly when the enforcement office turned the focus of it investigation onto the football team  but sometime before nutt s departure that same year  it did  the ncaa would later allege four level   violation committed by member of nutt s staff  including lying to investigator and fraudulent score for act testing <BRK>in an email to sb nation  nutt s attorney  thomas mar  wrote <BRK> of the   allegation in the january      noa  notice of allegation  involving the football program  only two of them allegedly occurred when houston nutt wa the head football coach  two more violation alleged in the noa related to alleged improper communication with witness and false and misleading statement by two former member of coach nutt s staff  however  these alleged violation occurred in   and    long after coach nutt had left ole miss  <BRK>that wa all to come  in the meantime  the rebel fired nutt and hired a mississippi native named hugh freeze   freeze s resume wa thin for any top coaching job  he had served just one year a a head coach at arkansa state  and spent only two year at a major program  when he wa a tight end coach and recruiting coordinator at ole miss  if his resume wa thin for a top coaching job  it seemed wildly unqualified for a head job in the sec west  college football s most lucrative   and cutthroat   division <BRK>but thanks in part to the bar set by nutt and an apathetic former administration  the job wa considered a loser by top tier candidate  freeze wa the best and most willing available coach at the time  and despite everything i m about to tell you  i believe if ole miss had to go back in time they d probably hire him again <BRK>why  because ole miss started winning football game  a lot of them  despite his inexperience  freeze quickly built up ole miss from the laughingstock of the sec west to one of the most fearsome program in college football <BRK>the ncaa came to oxford  mississippi  to look into other sport  the action of nutt s staff opened the door enough for the enforcement division to start poking around the football program <BRK>then  the ncaa cop didn t leave  for six year <BRK><BRK>about those cop  you should get to know ncaa enforcement  the policing arm of the ncaa s mission to  protect the game  <BRK>the lead investigator into ole miss football since at least   ha been a man named mike sheridan   there s not much available to describe sheridan  which is how the ncaa would prefer it  he s a white male  and  according to a source who spoke with him  he s originally from iowa  if you google  mike sheridan ncaa  one photo of him pop up  in which he is speaking to a group of university of richmond athlete  in the photo  he ha close cropped brown hair  and wear a button down with the sleeve rolled up <BRK>the ncaa declined to make sheridan available for comment for this story  though when reached for comment  ncaa director of public and medium relation stacey osburn referenced a previous statement given to sb nation on nov      the ncaa is always interested in pursuing behavior that harm college sport  including recruiting violation  when the enforcement staff receives information regarding potential violation  we thoroughly review that information to determine what happened  <BRK>if you believe the ncaa  the enforcement staff exists in order to protect the student athlete  but while the modern ncaa ha shown itelf to be toothless in policing actual criminal scandal  from baylor to michigan state  among it  membership  of coach  administrator and student athlete  they ve maintained a vigilant effort to stop the black market for player compensation <BRK>why  because if player  work ha demonstrated market value beyond the tuition and stipend and meal plan their school provide  then that lay waste to the ncaa s position that they are amateur <BRK>good college football player get paid cash money by booster to play for their team  even with a thriving black market  there s little chance these athlete are compensated for their fair market value in a sport that yield billion  leo lewis  is alleged to have received around      before deciding where to play college football <BRK>the ncaa s mission to stamp out financial compensation for athlete  both in it bylaw and policing  is often compared to the  war on drug  or prohibition   culturally tone deaf moral legislation that s comically and fruitlessly enforced <BRK>this metaphor is bullshit  it insult those oppressed by ncaa bylaw   the labor  this is not a morality play  a fair wage is not a vice in america  nor is it a threat to public welfare  there is absolutely no argument against compensation of college athlete except for one  the business model that yield billion of dollar for the steward of the ncaa  it corporate partner and it member institution  is most profitable if no one ha to pay the player <BRK>after five year of reporting on this story  it is my belief that ncaa enforcement is not there to protect the student athlete   they are there to protect the ncaa s business model <BRK><BRK>winning will get you noticed in college football  but recruiting will make you famous  from the moment he wa hired  hugh freeze began recruiting player once considered impossible to land at a fair to middling sec program like ole miss  he made this happen almost immediately  everyone in the sport noticed <BRK>his up tempo  aggressive offense sparked the program to a     finish in    but the campaign wa overshadowed by freeze s courtship of robert nkemdiche  the nation s no    overall recruit and brother of then rebel linebacker safety denzel nkemdiche <BRK>nkemdiche considering ole miss wa understandable   his brother played there  after all  however  freeze wa chasing a slew of top   overall talent  including the nation s best high school wide receiver  laquon treadwell  and the nation s top high school offensive lineman  laremy tunsil  <BRK>neither treadwell nor robert nkemdiche were ever named in any of the ncaa s notice of allegation against ole miss  tunsil  on the other hand  wa <BRK>on   national signing day  the day when college football recruit announce what school they will attend  freeze landed all three  thrusting the program into the national spotlight both for the astounding haul and the method involved  the college football world asked  how in the world wa a rookie sec coach at a    program doing this <BRK>they had to have been cheating  right <BRK>at leat that wa the speculation  a the commitment arrived  so too did the narrative that ole miss wa throwing cah at recruit and their family to become a big time program <BRK>accusation of cheating are a much a function of southern culture a the college football itself  it s born out of the twin pillar of pasion for the game and gross economic inequity  poor black men play football  rich white men want them to play for their team <BRK>ask any fan base and they ll tell you with great passion   and in great detail   how their arch rival are doing dirty buiness to get ahead  ask them if their team is doing the same and they ll clutch pearl  everyone cheat but u <BRK>the ncaa s misguided mandate of amateurism result in rampant cheating in order to succeed in college football  so the point of all of this isn t to determine if ole miss wa cheating  that s a given  the point of the ncaa s investigation could only prove whether or not ole miss wa any good at cheating   spoiler  not at all  <BRK> the problem at ole miss wa that the head coach wa searching his own name on twitter every damn day   a former staffer in the ole miss program said   he became fixated on the criticism  he never got it  never understood it s just part of the job  and most  head  coach don t give a shit about what s said about them on social medium because they aren t reading it anyway  <BRK>rather than ignore that somewhat customary noise  freeze made the biggest public relation gaffe of his career  in a since deleted tweet  freeze wrote   if you have fact about a violation  send it to compliance olemiss edu  if not  please do not slander these young men or insult their family    sic <BRK> nothing will haunt u more than that stupid tweet   a source at ole miss said <BRK>ncaa enforcement wa already on campus  they were already poking around when the football program  out of nowhere  landed the most talented recruiting class in the school s history  and now the head coach wa challenging them  and notoriously gossipy rival  on social medium <BRK>freeze s timing could not have been worse  when he sent that infamous tweet the ncaa s enforcement division wa still reeling in the aftermath of the   scandal at the university of miami  where it wa discovered that ncaa enforcement official  lacking subpoena power  had relied on  and paid  an attorney in a separate bankruptcy cae to depose witness on their behalf  the fallout led to the attorney being suspended by the florida bar  a well a a complete overhaul of the ncaa s enforcement staff in   <BRK>ncaa enforcement needed a win and freeze s tweet wa a giant neon sign <BRK> why would you ever challenge the ncaa  no coach on earth would do that  nothing good can happen  nothing   an sec head coach said   even if you really  truly believe you re running a clean   technically clean   program top to bottom  you can t be naive enough to believe that somewhere in the hundred of people that touch your football team that there isn t something going on the ncaa could build a violation out of  <BRK>freeze refused to comment on the record for this story <BRK>nothing changed at first  ole miss built on their   signing coup and began to eke into the national conversation with a six point upset over alabama in    that year  the rebel fell short of winning the sec west title but ended up with a new year s bowl game appearance <BRK>freeze s staff continued to recruit like a national power and the program began to market itself accordingly  but internally the rebel were committing a litany of minor and major mistake that would lead to violation  some were shockingly dumb  but most were the same kind of cut and cheat that  according to insider  real college football powerhouse make consistently  the important difference is  other school know how to cover them up <BRK>freeze s recruiting drew notice but he really wanted to be known a an offensive guru  among peer  however  he wa already infamous a  preacher hugh   a nickname borne from freeze s brasy christian proselytizing  there were the frequent quote from scripture on his twitter feed  the prayer before team meeting captured in espn all access video  regardless of your opinion about faith  there s no arguing that hugh freeze sold the absolute shit out of holy rolling   a a recruiting tool  a an ethos  and a a marketing tool for his great rebel campaign <BRK>this enraged other head coach  even beyond ole miss  sudden relevance on the field  to rival program  especially archrival mississippi state  freeze wa a loathsome archetype  christian celebrity in public  arrogant cheater in private <BRK>illustration by josh schielie<BRK>the ncaa s investigation in oxford survived because the lindsey miller  problem never got fixed  miller wa laremy tunsil  s stepfather and watched a tunsil went from sought after recruit to ole miss  best shot at a no    overall

laremy tunsil  s stepfather and watched a tunsil went from sought after recruit to ole miss  best shot at a no    overall nfl draft pick since eli manning over the course of his career there  according to multiple source connected to the program  miller had long been known a a potentially problematic hanger on in tunsil s camp  greedy and overzealous  dating back to before tunsil signed with the rebel <BRK>of hugh freeze  s  big    signing in the   class  critic considered tunsil the most suspicious win  nkemdiche s brother wa a defensive starter for the rebel  and even treadwell  an illinois native  had a high school teammate on the roster  tunsil  a floridian  had no direct connection to the rebel and passed over offer from far more successful program  miller came along for the ride  moving to oxford along with tunsil and his mother  desiree polingo <BRK>two year after tunsil and miller arrived in mississippi  both filed charge for domestic violence against one another after the pair had a physical altercation at miller and polingo s shared residence on june       miller told the medium the fight centered around tunsil s interaction with prospective nfl agent <BRK>during a court hearing in lafayette county justice court on july       tunsil testified that miller had physically attacked his mother  polingo told the court miller became angry when he thought he wa being cut out of tunsil s potential future earnings <BRK>polingo also testified about an earlier physical altercation between tunsil and miller that happened back in    when tunsil wa playing in the army all american game in san antonio  miller had travelled to the event with tunsil and polingo and the family had a meal at a local mexican restaurant with coach from the university of georgia <BRK>per ncaa bylaw  georgia coach were not permitted to pay for the family s dinner  miller  enraged at having to pay  confronted polingo and tunsil about it in their hotel room  according to polingo <BRK>according to conventional recruiting wisdom  that should ve been a flag for school interested in tunsil s service   you recruit your problem   said a former sec assistant coach who evaluated tunsil   it wa evident at that time that recruiting laremy tunsil meant recruiting the stepfather  that s not fair to the kid  but fair doesn t matter if that family member is going to threaten your entire program  ole miss brought  miller  into their program  into their community  they knew  there is absolutely no way the coach who recruited him didn t understand that relationship and the problem he posed  <BRK>a source involved in player compensation   known a a  bagman  in college football circle   at a rival sec program outside of mississippi concurred <BRK> so now if there s no arguing that ole miss is having it booster pay player  how in the world do you not take care of the situation with miller  how doe that go unnoticed  there s absolutely no way that caught their booster by surprise  <BRK>after miller disastrously represented himself in court  he and tunsil dropped domestic violence charge against one another  but not long afterward  miller filed a lawsuit against tunsil for  intentional infliction of emotional distress  <BRK>this time in court  however  miller  a floridian with no obvious connection to the state of mississippi before moving to oxford  wasn t alone  he d found representation from a lawyer named matthew wilson  a starkville  miss   based attorney  mississippi state alumnus and  according to source i spoke with  a bulldog fan <BRK>in a phone call  wilson read the following statement to sb nation   due to the constraint of litigation  neither mr  miller nor i are presently able to address question you have raised relating to mr  miller s comment to the ncaa or pertaining to his relationship with laremy tunsil <BRK> with that said  you have also have inquired about my personal relationship with mississippi state university  i graduated from mississippi state   year ago with a degree in industrial engineering <BRK> i have been a fan of mississippi state for most of my life  however  my support of the hail state family ha been limited to the money i ve fed parking meter while checking my mail on campus  for food that i have eaten in the union  and for nosebleed seat at football and basketball game  <BRK>miller now had representation in court  by this time  he had also already started talking to the ncaa <BRK><BRK>shortly after the june   fight with his stepson  miller spoke to ncaa enforcement about tunsil s recruitment by ole miss  a process miller told sport illustrated lasted over   hour <BRK>the ncaa used the information miller gave to build it initial notice of allegation  the official method by which the ncaa let an institution know what rule it is alleged to have violated  against ole miss  charge that included    in cah allegedly paid to miller by a booster  a well a free lodging at local motel and apartment  and  according to multiple source  buried in those   or so hour of contact with ncaa enforcement  miller mentioned he and tunsil received free merchandise from an apparel shop in oxford named rebel rag <BRK>miller s account of tunsil s recruitment were enough to create multiple level   allegation   the most serious in the ncaa rule book   against ole miss  a the ncaa built a cae around miller s vendetta against tunsil and polingo  who had by then filed for divorce from miller  ole miss withdrew tunsil from active play for fear of having to forfeit game for using an ineligible player  the rebel would do the unthinkable and beat alabama for a second straight year  more impressive that they had done so without their junior left tackle  who wa all but certain to leave following the   seaon for the nfl <BRK>without miller  ncaa enforcement wouldn t have been able to build a substantial case past the houston nutt  era violation  without miller  the ncaa wouldn t have learned about rebel rag <BRK>a lot of people cheat in this story  and more lie  don t get distracted <BRK>that s not to say the ncaa viewed miller any more credibly than the college football recruiter who d been wary of tunsil because of him  multiple source confirmed to sb nation that even lead investigator mike sheridan  acknowledged miller s dubious motif and character during a   hearing against ole miss in front of the ncaa s committee on infraction  or coi  the group that levy punishment at the conclusion of ncaa investigation  but sheridan ultimately concluded that despite concern  miller s statement were still credible <BRK>it s worth taking a moment here to remember that the ncaa ha said  many time  that it exists to protect the wellbeing of the student athlete <BRK>yet in it investigation into ole miss  the ncaa had no qualm building a case around the word of a man who  according to the testimony of his former wife  told the family   y all are going to pay for this    you ain t shit  you ain t never been shit  and you ain t about shit and you re going to reap what you sow  <BRK>miller s integrity and motive had already been challenged in a real court of law  but the ncaa s justice system   the investigation  the closed door coi interview   operates in a vacuum  i believe there is no due process  in college football  from all that i have seen  credibility is a malleable concept <BRK><BRK>by the end of the   seaon the rebel were closing in on their first sugar bowl in decade just a the ncaa finished framing it notice of allegation around miller s statement  entering the   signing cycle  freeze wa now recruiting player to an established national power <BRK>that s why ole miss kept right on lying <BRK>on jan        the school received it first notice of allegation  noa  from the ncaa  the noa detailed a total of   violation against the ole miss football program  nine of which the ncaa alleged to have occurred during hugh freeze s tenure <BRK>a week later  multiple medium outlet  including sb nation  reported that ole miss source believed most of the major violation were not related to freeze s tenure  in fact  these source said  most of what the ncaa wa alleging had happened under houston nutt <BRK>here s what we reported at the time <BRK>one ole miss source tell steven godfrey they believe only five of the   are alleged football violation  and that coach are  confident  allegation related to the current staff are secondary violation  in addition  an ncaa source tell  sb nation reporter  bud elliott that the  vast majority  of the football allegation are more than two year old <BRK>   <BRK>an ole miss official told godfrey that almost all of the allegation are woman s basketball  track  tunsil  and football from six year ago  during previous coach houston nutt s tenure <BRK>i now know that most of what i wa told that day wa untrue <BRK>i don t know who among ole miss representative thought it would be wise to lie to multiple member of the national medium about an ncaa investigation  the detail of which would eventually become public  but i know why they did <BRK>when the noa wa received    national signing day  the day when college football recruit announce what school they will be attending  wa two week away  it seems likely that ole miss source lied because the program wa trying to hold onto it recruiting class <BRK>it doesn t matter who authored this strategy inside ole miss   the athletic department  the coaching staff or some mix thereof  it would end up being a massive gaffe for everyone at the university  not only did it hurt the program s credibility among the medium when they d later make valid claim against the ncaa  mississippi state and other party  but it created a new enemy in houston nutt <BRK>making an enemy of houston nutt would end up costing hugh freeze his job in the most embarrassing way possible <BRK>since his   firing  nutt had failed to secure another head coaching job despite multiple attempt  his coaching career wa  for all intent and purpose  over  but ole miss  sourced claim in medium report  including sb nation  gave nutt new life to assert his career ended not because his own lack of success on the field but a conspiracy against his good name <BRK>making an enemy of nutt would end up costing hugh freeze his job in the most embarrassing way possible  we ll get there  hang on <BRK><BRK>let s say you re laremy tunsil  you re in college and hellbound to make good on your nfl potential  that s your sole focus in life   get to the league  get paid  make a life for yourself and change your family s future <BRK>and let s say along the way to that goal  while navigating the part of college football no one ever told you about  you receive a few hundred buck or a free night in a motel  or even just a sofa to sleep on at a coach s house <BRK>you ve also got a family member trying to manage your career for his own end  plus a growing entourage of people handing you gift  all trying to get close before that payday come <BRK>if you want any of this to stop   unless you are   percent pure of heart by ncaa eligibility standard   you are fucked <BRK>no one will help you  your school  who control your public image and your football career  doesn t want to be punished by the ncaa  the ncaa s enforcement staff would love to talk to you  but if you cop to so much a one night of sleeping on a coach s sofa  you run the risk they ll rule you ineligible  potentially crippling your career before it begin <BRK>you are on your own  and that s how laremy tunsil s draft night disaster wa born <BRK>if you re a sport fan  hell even if you re not  you probably remember tunsil s nfl draft night  that wa the night that video and text message from tunsil  projected by some to go no    overall  were leaked out on social medium   minute before the draft wa set to begin <BRK>there wa the video of tunsil smoking out of a gas mask bong in front of a confederate flag  there were text from tunsil asking john miller  an ole miss employee  no relation to lindsey miller   for help paying his mother s bill <BRK>in the leaked text john miller tell tunsil to  see barney next week   meaning barney farrar   the ole miss staffer who wa freeze s right hand man in recruiting  remember farrar  he ll be back <BRK>in the moment after the video  a sport fan watched tunsil s draft stock evaporate in real time  people close to the story asumed it wa lindsey miller s doing  miller had motive  and wa already working with the ncaa in it investigation  a a former family member  he seemed most likely to have access to tunsil s cell phone <BRK>but according to multiple source close to the family  they believe a would be  business manager   to tunsil commandeered his social medium to leak the embarrassing video and text message that night <BRK>according to these source  some time before signing with freeze s agent  jimmy sexton  during christmas of    tunsil had dumped this  business manager  <BRK>how tunsil ran into trouble  according to multiple source  this  manager  had previously gifted tunsil with a new smart device and offered to transfer tunsil s account information  that s how he allegedly got tunsil s pasword  which source say gave him access to tunsil s most sensitive material  the jilted person waited until the moment the nfl draft started and unloaded  costing tunsil million a he dropped from a surefire top three pick to  th  where he landed with the miami dolphin   nfl rookie salary structure is tied to draft placement  so dropping   spot in the draft wa estimated to have cost tunsil    million dollar in guaranteed money  <BRK>don t get distracted by the weed and the ga mak  though  a titillating a they were to see on social medium  nfl team might have cared  but no one in this story did  everyone   hugh freeze  ole miss  miller  the ncaa  everyone   only cared about what wa posted on tunsil s instagram after that video   the text message  those showed the conversation between a star college athlete aking someone at his school for money  and moment later on the national broadcat  a visibly nervous tunsil confirmed to reporter that  yes  he had received that cah <BRK>it s a common misperception that the ncaa  re opened the case  against ole miss after draft night  this isn t true   based on available evidence the ncaa wa already re investigating ole miss month prior when they spoke to mississippi state s signees <BRK>draft night didn t restart the investigation  but it did certify the enforcement staff s effort <BRK>if freeze s tweet drew a neon target around ole miss  the nationally televised tunsil hack gave the ncaa a mandate  they had to make this count <BRK>illustration by josh schielie<BRK>the first time i remember hearing leo lewis   name in conjunction with the ncaa investigation wa in the fall of    a source connected to ole miss called  unprompted  to tell me the persistent rumor about the ncaa releasing a second  more substantial notice of allegation  noa  against the school were true  by this point  post draft night  it wa public record that the ncaa wa still investigating ole miss <BRK>the first time i remember hearing leo lewis   name in conjunction with the ncaa investigation wa in the fall of    a source connected to ole miss called  unprompted  to tell me the persistent rumor about the ncaa releasing a second  more substantial notice of allegation  noa  against the school were true  by this point  post draft night  it wa public record that the ncaa wa still investigating ole miss <BRK>i asked if the pending noa would be built around laremy tunsil  and lindsey miller   certainly that made sense <BRK> no  this is something else  the lewis kid at mississippi state  he told them about his recruiting  <BRK>i dismissed it at the time a bullshit  more message board rumor mongering  already burned by a report that cited multiple ole miss source that year  i laughed it off  i wa sure the ncaa had to be building it cae around miller and tunsil <BRK>then  in july    i met with jon duncan  vice president of enforcement at the ncaa  at his indianapolis office <BRK>in the aftermath of draft night  i wa curious about how the ncaa wa handling such an unprecedented event  never before had an active ncaa investigation been subject to this kind of public attention  even miami <BRK>duncan declined to discus specific of the investigation  even casually  but i d left the two hour meeting with a firm belief that  following the miami fallout and the embarrassment of tunsil s draft night  the ncaa enforcement office wa so paranoid about public perception they would not try anything that could possibly bring more public scrutiny <BRK>i grew up around police  and duncan reminded me of good police   calm  focused  and careful  being around him  i wa reminded of an old phrase i d heard many time before  we don t make the law or sentence anyone  we just enforce what s on the book  these were men and woman who were just doing their job <BRK>it wa because of that meeting i had a hard time believing the source  it just didn t make any sense that the ncaa would build a case around leo lewis <BRK>from what i believed at the time  lewis had  smartly  i should add  taken money from half the sec west <BRK>i ve never met lewis  i didn t cover his recruiting personally  and mississippi state and lewis  lawyer have denied any request for contact or comment <BRK>we know lewis  story follows a common path   he wa a talented  sought after linebacker from a poor family in brookhaven  mississippi  his father is in prison and he fathered a child in high school  and we know the usually invisible life of a poor black family in the rural south wa upended by demand for lewis  football service in the southeastern conference <BRK>from what s available in interview  lewis is by most account a normal teenager   he s mild mannered in front of medium he wa never trained to handle  happy when talking about football  on twitter  lewis is fond of posting inspirational quote  and in may posted a reference to the first epistle of peter       do not repay evil with evil or insult with insult  on the contrary  repay evil with blessing  because to this you were called so that you may inherit a blessing  <BRK>lewis wa recruited by many school in the sec  and according to rumor going around at the time  took money from a lot of them  which is why i assumed there wa absolutely no way the ncaa wa going to build a case against just one school on leo lewis  from what i believed at the time  lewis had  smartly  i should add  taken money from half the sec west <BRK>after miami  after laremy tunsil s draft night  it just didn t seem possible the ncaa would build a case against one school based off the testimony of someone with lewis  recruitment history   not to mention the fact he currently played for ole miss  rival   on conflict of interest alone  it would look bad  if he took money from the school i d heard he had taken money from  they d have to investigate the entire conference <BRK>i didn t buy it  and i told my source a much <BRK> i m serious   he said <BRK> no  you re delusional   i said  i hung up angry  convinced i wa being fed more bullshit because i wa an ole miss alumnus in the medium <BRK>i wa wrong <BRK><BRK>starkville  mississippi  home of mississippi state university  is   mile southeast of oxford  if you ve never been to the state  it s fair to say that the rivalry can be summed up by the usual trope of the ag school  mississippi state in starkville  v  the gilded liberal art hub  ole miss in oxford   except these difference are played out in mississippi s extreme  at ole miss  you have the vanity and antebellum fringe of magnolia and white column  starkville is more working class  hard  the mississippi state campus surrounded by fiercely agrarian landscape that create the kind of high lonesome feeling usually found in the american west <BRK>in le literary term  if you re an ole miss fan  you re probably an asshole lawyer in seersucker  if you re a mississippi state fan  you re probably an asshole redneck in camouflage  mississippi is a small place   the campus are a two hour drive apart   which mean a lot of these folk know each other  too <BRK>month before i told off my source on that phone call  the ncaa had quietly made contact with player who had committed to mississippi state  how the ncaa found them is an interesting question <BRK>in february    two football player who had committed to mississippi state  kobe jones  and jeffery simmons  spoke to the ncaa about their recruitment by ole miss  both were interviewed only a week after committing to play in starkville <BRK>during those interview  both jones and simmons were asked specifically about any experience they might have had at rebel rag during their recruitment by ole miss <BRK>simmons  a five star recruit  denied receiving anything from rebel rag  jones  however  volunteered specific  detailed account of free merchandise he received on multiple visit <BRK>jones  statement to the ncaa had problem  however  for one  jones  high school coach  who drove him to visit oxford  would later claim in an affidavit that the only thing jones took home from rebel rag wa a baseball cap and shirt the coach personally purchased for him <BRK>if you re an ole miss fan  you re probably an asshole lawyer in seersucker  if you re a mississippi state fan  you re probably an asshole redneck in camouflage <BRK>multiple source confirmed that  in    hugh freeze  told the ncaa s committee on infraction that ole miss had stopped recruiting jones  a two star prospect  before he signed with their rival  according to those source  freeze also told the coi that  after he told jones he wa no longer being recruited by ole miss  jones said to him   you ll pay for that  <BRK>now you may be asking yourself why mississippi state signees would volunteer to speak with ncaa enforcement   remember  there s no subpoena power   about ole miss just week after they had committed to play for the bulldog  without any confirmation of their motif we can only know the outcome of that discussion  a few month after the ncaa spoke to jones and simmons  enforcement began speaking with leo lewis  too <BRK>the ncaa wa taking a new tact in it investigation  lindsey miller had mentioned rebel rag giving away free apparel to ole miss recruit  and now the ncaa wa in starkville talking to player who had been recruited by both school about the same t shirt shop <BRK><BRK>in hindsight  mississippi state signees  cooperation with the ncaa make sense  nowhere wa ole miss  rapid ascension more loathed than in starkville  and no one stood to lose more from hugh freeze s rise to dominance than mississippi state head coach dan mullen  <BRK>alabama ha won  or shared  the sec west crown in eight of the last   season  during which time both mississippi program attempted to modernize and resurrect historically moribund program  mullen arrived to coach the bulldog in    three season before freeze landed in oxford <BRK>he d risen to national attention by overseeing the the florida offense that won tim tebow a heisman  but prior to that the new hampshire native had spent time around the country gaining experience a an asistant <BRK>though an unconnected outsider  mullen quickly won over mississippi state fan by targeting their in state rival  from the first day he arrived on campus he refused to even speak the word  ole miss   he built all of his public persona around the absolute importance of winning the egg bowl  the annual rivalry game played between the two school  tapping into the dna of a fan bae that didn t mind life a an also ran in the sec nearly a much a they loathed losing to the preppy snot up the road in oxford <BRK>once freeze got hired and started winning big in recruiting  mullen s mississippi state team wa quickly overshadowed  even a quarterback dak prescott  now a star for the dalla cowboy  gave the bulldog a mini renaissance  in    mississippi state lost the egg bowl again  the second time in three year  to freeze <BRK> dan  mullen  took off while houston  nutt  wa in oxford and thought he could keep that level of dominance going  when freeze wa hired   thing were easy  i don t think he ever understood the amount of thing working against msu when ole miss ha it going   a former msu assistant told me <BRK>proximity to freeze also had another detrimental effect on mullen  before    it wa well known in coaching circle that mullen had pursued bigger job  feeling that his work building state into a scrappy threat would earn him a top level gig  it never worked out  mullen became the annual name kicked around in rumor during the coaching hiring cycle  but each year he remained in starkville <BRK>freeze  meanwhile  would parlay the rebel    season into interest from florida  mullen s old employer  freeze and his agent jimmy sexton flirted with the gator long enough to push ole miss to a      million annual contract  previously unheard of in mississippi <BRK> mullen wa obsessed with ole miss   a coach who interviewed for a staff position with the bulldog told sb nation   it wa the first thing he wanted to talk about when you mentioned recruiting or mississippi   what the hell are they doing over there  do you know anything   <BRK>in a statement provided to sb nation in november  mullen wrote <BRK> the ncaa found no major violation for mississippi state related to the ole miss case  i am also not familiar with what is in the ncaa testimony in this case because i didn t speak to leo about his testimony  either beforehand or afterwards  <BRK>mullen denied that he instructed his player to go to the ncaa with information about violation committed by his team s biggest rival  but in    with no obvious incentive  three of his player did just that <BRK><BRK>on feb        ole miss announced it had received a second  amended notice of allegation from the ncaa  bumping the total allegation against the football program to   total  of the nine new and expanded allegation  five came a a direct result of a student athlete s testimony to the ncaa <BRK>the student athlete in question  referred to in the document a  student athlete     wa leo lewis <BRK>my source had been right <BRK>the school releaed a bizarre pre recorded video  known a  the bunker tape  among local medium  announcing a self imposed one year bowl ban and scholarship restriction  college program will often announce self imposed penalty ahead of ncaa hearing in the hope that the ncaa will be more lenient  the odd taped press briefing featured a haggard looking freeze alongside athletic director ross bjork  and university chancellor jeffrey vitter  in it  the trio admitted to some wrongdoing   hence the self imposed violation   but fiercely denied the allegation pertaining to  student athlete    in the notice  which wa lewis <BRK>that night lewis tweeted a gif of heath ledger s joker from  the dark knight  clapping with mock amusement  the tweet seemed to acknowledge what had already been reported  that he wa in fact  student athlete     ole miss fan were furious  mississippi state fan celebrated <BRK>compared to miller  lewis  statement gave the ncaa real ammunition  a firsthand account of large cash payment  free hotel  and another account of merchandise gift from rebel rag <BRK>he didn t know it at the time  but what lewis told the ncaa could also potentially destroy his future <BRK><BRK>so what exactly did lewis say  enough to outline the micro economy of college football recruiting <BRK>on aug        lewis and his lawyer met with mike sheridan  of the ncaa enforcement staff at a hilton garden inn in starkville  this wa the first of three interview  the transcript of which were all obtained and verified by sb nation <BRK>according to the transcript  lewis told sheridan he never paid for a meal or a motel when he made an unofficial visit  while a university is allowed to pay for transportation and lodging during a recruit s official visit  the recruit ha to pay his own way on an unofficial one  lewis also told sheridan he received free food  free drink  and payment of    to     two or three time  from lee harris  owner of an oxford bar named funkys  after meeting him in the rebel  practice facility on campus <BRK>harris declined to comment for this story <BRK>lewis also said in the ncaa interview that on one occasion he received    worth of merchandise  including  yes  t shirt  at rebel rag  he said he went there after he told ole miss staffer barney farrar  that he wanted some ole miss apparel  farrar is the same  barney  that laremy tunsil wa instructed to go see about money in the text message that were leaked during the nfl draft <BRK>farrar  who wa fired from his position a the rebel  asistant a d  for high school and junior college relation in december    wa discussed at length in lewis  interview  lewis said farrar arranged everything lewis wanted or aked for   lodging  food  and  via third party  cah  lewis told the ncaa he and farrar were  very tight  and spoke at leat five time a week on the phone during his junior and senior year of high school <BRK>farrar declined to speak on the record for this story  citing a pending appeal to the ncaa <BRK>lewis also told sheridan he received cash payment of    to    on multiple occasion from a woman named phyllis  who lewis said worked for an ole miss booster in jackson  mississippi  lewis said the payment began in    after his father wa sent to prison and lewis became a parent to a baby girl <BRK>and then there wa the headline grabber  according to the transcript  lewis claimed to have received a      cash payment from an ole miss booster named  allen   lewis wan t sure if it wa his first or last name  in the parking lot of a hampton inn in brookhaven on feb        one day before national signing day <BRK>at that point  transcript show  sheridan started talking about barney farrar s phone <BRK>farrar turned over his university issued phone a part of the ncaa s investigation and  according to transcript  enforcement official suggested farrar had made frequent  steady contact with lewis <BRK>sheridan then pulled up a text message from  allen  to leo lewis  that  allen  had then forwarded on to farrar  in that text   allen  is panicked  having read on an lsu message board that lewis wa headed to baton rouge <BRK> you swore to me on your daughter please call me   sic  he wrote to lewis   you owe me that  <BRK>when sheridan showed lewis the text message  lewis responded that he hadn t answered the text or returned subsequent call from  allen  <BRK> i just didn t want to   lewis said <BRK>he told the group he had never intended on signing with ole miss and that  despite taking the payment from  allen   at the time of the alleged meeting he wa still deciding between lsu and mississippi state <BRK>he also had trouble nailing down the exact time of the meeting with  allen   first saying it wa  in the noon   then saying it wa between   and   p m   before insisting it wa daylight out  when the ncaa finally asked lewis in his third interview if he received money from other school in his recruitment  and he confirmed he had  the ncaa redacted the name of one of the school from the official transcript <BRK>in an aug        letter to the ncaa  ole miss counsel wrote   although the name of this other institution wa redacted in the material provided to the university and other involved party in this case  it ha since come to light that the institution mr  lewis identified wa mississippi state university   mississippi state    <BRK>the letter  which wa obtained by sb nation  also alleges that ncaa enforcement confirmed to ole miss that they had  quickly opened and subsequently closed  an investigation into mississippi state because lewis s statement about receiving money from mississippi state were deemed to be  ultimately     not sufficiently credible to support an allegation  <BRK>in the second meeting with ncaa investigator  in which ole miss had representation present  lewis wa pressed by mike glazier  an attorney brought in by ole miss  a to why he took the money <BRK> i just wanted the money   cause i needed it   he said  according to the transcript       we wa moving to a house  and i actually had my daughter  my dad had just went to prison  uh yeah  so needed it  so i took it   i  asked for it  and i took it  <BRK>illustration by josh schielie<BRK>about those t shirt    <BRK>about those t shirt    <BRK>it s easy even now to overlook them in the statement made above by leo lewis   but it s the t shirt  not the cash  that turned this case from a college sport matter to one with serious  real life consequence <BRK>the second notice of allegation against ole miss wa issued in february   with new violation added based on lewis  testimony in those three interview  the detail of the violation weren t publicly known but the noa led to month of speculation around mississippi that rebel rag wa involved <BRK>then  in a june       report from yahoo sport  terry warren  and his business  rebel rag  were named publicly a one of the ole miss booster mentioned in the notice of allegation <BRK>and that s when lewis  life got very  very complicated <BRK>two day after the yahoo report  warren s lawyer charles merkel jr   filed a lawsuit against lewis in lafayette county circuit court for defamation  slander  conspiracy  and commercial disparagement  the suit alleged that false statement made to the ncaa had damaged warren s business <BRK>the suit also named lewis  teammate kobe jones   a well a lindsey miller   the former stepfather of laremy tunsil   since they had all mentioned receiving free stuff from rebel rag <BRK>lewis likely only spoke to the ncaa because he received conditional immunity   a promise from the ncaa that if he told them the truth  he wouldn t lose his eligibility for anything he d done or received to that point of his collegiate career <BRK>but while the ncaa could protect lewis  team  and his eligibility  they could not protect him from the american legal system  in real court  their bylaw and investigatory practice were meaningless <BRK>on top of that  merkel and warren seemed to have a decent case <BRK>in his interview with the ncaa  lewis said that when he received the    in t shirt and other merchandise  the cashier had swiped  like  this gift card  and then bagged up the free stuff for him <BRK>lawyer for rebel rag argued there were no gift card used in any transaction on the day in question  nor were there any gift card with a balance greater than    in existence at that time <BRK>in that same interview with the ncaa  lewis also said that rebel rag employee had removed security tag to provide him with the free apparel <BRK>in the lawsuit and in an interview with sb nation  merkel said that warren s store didn t use security tag  warren and his attorney also claim they ve provided multiple statement to the ncaa  a well a inventory report and cah register transaction record  that the ncaa ha refused to review <BRK>via his attorney  warren declined to comment on this story  citing pending litigation <BRK>leo lewis is nothing if not a psa to any current or future student athlete  never  ever talk to the ncaa <BRK>at the time the suit seemed to potentially damage lewis the most  in the three year since his signing  lewis became the player recruiting analyst projected   he wa the bulldog  second leading tackler and an sec defensive freshman of the year  now the msu linebacker wa eligible to enter the nfl draft and become a millionaire  the rebel rag suit sought his current and future earnings  meaning lewis could now be financially liable for statement he wa asked to make to the ncaa about a school he never went to <BRK>no one at the ncaa or mississippi state ha clearly stated the series of event and parameter that led leo lewis to speak to the ncaa  the only information we do have is an ncaa enforcement claim that they began to speak with the mississippi state player a a result of a tip they received in april   from a confidential source that wan t affiliated with any sec school <BRK>that doesn t explain why lewis felt compelled to cooperate  wa he forced to by threat of his own eligibility  did he up and volunteer to snitch  wa he volunteered by msu <BRK>it s important to one day understand how exactly lewis came to speak to the ncaa  because their hackneyed rule and system ultimately failed to protect him from a much more dangerous attack   a real  actual lawsuit in real  actual court <BRK>leo lewis is nothing if not a psa to any current or future student athlete  never  ever talk to the ncaa  if lewis loses his case  and one day make it to the nfl  whatever money he s yet to even make could end up in the bank account of a t shirt store in a town filled with people who hate him <BRK><BRK>rebel rag wan t alone trying to litigate the ncaa s sprawling investigation in civil court  remember houston nutt   the former rebel coach wa still out of college football in    and understandably upset that hugh freeze  and ole miss source had told multiple member of the medium  including me  that the ncaa s investigation wa centered around violation that occurred when he wa head coach  nutt hired a lawyer in arkansa named thoma mar  who went to work finding a way to sue ole miss  to maximize medium interest  mar filed the lawsuit right a freeze wa headed to sec medium day in july   <BRK>while preparing to file the lawsuit  mar filed a public record request for the phone record of hugh freeze in an effort to prove freeze had corresponded directly with particular medium member to smear his client in january   <BRK>here s where the story took a turn for the bizarre or  depending on whose side you are on in this whole thing  the righteous  in the course of filing a record request  mar  office got a batch of phone record from the wrong date in question  that would not have been a big deal  except that mar passed the record along to a reporter named steve robertson  a man who ha long been the bane of ole miss fan everywhere <BRK>robertson is a reporter and mississippi state acolyte   he ha the school s logo tattooed on his hand  he also routinely tweeted out vague comment and prediction throughout the course of the ole miss investigation  many of which turned out to be accurate  implying he had inside information  this infuriated ole miss fan and official  who speculated that msu source on robertson s beat were involved in the ncaa s case <BRK>tattoo or no  fan or not  robertson went about doing the work of a reporter  he started verifying every number called by freeze s university issued phone  that s how he found the number to an escort service <BRK>for year  whisper of hypocrisy had followed freeze for publicly intertwining his faith with the moral ambiguity required to run a successful college football program  his undoing wa too cliche even for awful fiction <BRK>why a man call an escort service is one thing  why he doe so on a university issued phone subject to public record request is another  hubris  sloppiness  self sabotage after year of ceaseless scrutiny by the ncaa  why didn t the man buy another cell phone to make those kind of call <BRK> because he is the cheapest motherfucker i ve ever met   an ole miss booster told me the night of freeze s resignation <BRK>freeze resigned on july       his downfall had nothing to do with the ncaa  with lewis or tunsil or football at all  it wa the other pay for play  the escort service   a failure of character standard for a head coach   the university statement said <BRK>it wa robertson s reporting  not the ncaa s investigation  that pushed freeze to resign  had the false claim that the notice of allegation were primarily centered around nutt never been made  thomas mar never pull those phone record and robertson never start dialing <BRK><BRK>it wa fall    freeze wa gone  the ncaa s investigation into ole miss  which started a a look into the woman s baketball and track team  wa now in it sixth year  the investigation had grown and spread and taken more turn than i could remember  but it finally looked to be heading toward conclusion <BRK>on september    in a hotel conference room in covington  kentucky  the committee on infraction  coi    the panel of administrator that act a judge and jury in ncaa investigation   would make a decision on the fate of ole miss <BRK>leo lewis  in the middle of his sophomore season with the bulldog  would be forced to attend <BRK>this investigation  which the ncaa had been building off and on for six year  would finally punish ole miss for it many alleged misdeed  but heading into that hearing in covington  my reporting showed just how thin ncaa enforcement s case actually wa <BRK>looking at the second notice of allegation that had been issued  the ncaa seemed to be building it case against ole miss almost entirely off the testimony of  student athlete      leo lewis  but ole miss lawyer claim the ncaa had already admitted to them that investigator had opened and then closed a case into lewis  claim that he wa also paid to attend mississippi state because they determined his statement were not credible  so to the ncaa  lewis wa considered a credible witness about ole miss  yet not a credible one when it came to his own school <BRK>lewis himself couldn t account for a lot of the money he supposedly had received  and on top of that  according to a filing obtained by sb nation  lawyer arguing on behalf of a former ole miss coach wanted to introduce a sworn affidavit from armani linton   an ole miss player and friend of lewis   who said lewis told him that dan mullen  himself had met with lewis to discus what he would talk to the ncaa about <BRK>basically  the case stunk  that s not because ole miss wa squeaky clean  by any mean  the case stunk because it stunk <BRK>none of this really mattered  other than to show exactly how the new ncaa wa still very willing to bend information to fit a predetermined outcome  even at the expense of it own student athlete   not to mention it new reputation among coach  especially in the sec  a having weaponized rivalry <BRK>with the college football world watching  the party involved converged on covington  what happened is probably what you expected  a   year old kid got put in a room with a lot of lawyer  and wa forced to answer a ton of question  and he didn t do too well <BRK>detail from lewis  testimony in his first three meeting with the ncaa were fudged  timeline weren t quite right  according to source in the room  lewis couldn t account for what happened to all of the money <BRK>there is only one lesson here  don t get caught  ever <BRK>then  the big one  according to source in the room  lewis told the committee on infraction he received a cash payment of       from mississippi state  on the eve of national signing day   to sign with the bulldog <BRK>when pressed by member of the coi to elaborate  lewis stated he received money to attend mississippi state from calvin green  a defensive back coach for copiah lincoln community college in wesson  mississippi  green is the father of farrod green  lewis  friend and mississippi state teammate  farrod green s name is important because  according to the transcript of the meeting between the ncaa and leo lewis  the ncaa frequently used his statement to validate lewis  claim about receiving free benefit   from ole miss <BRK>neither farrod green nor copiah lincoln community college responded to a request for comment for this story <BRK>according to multiple source in the room  ncaa head of enforcement jon duncan  who i had that meeting with at ncaa headquarters  then turned to the committee member and pointed out that not all payment made to player are against ncaa bylaw <BRK> ok  if that s what you re going with   a committee member responded <BRK> duncan wasn t wrong  because green could reasonably argue that he knew lewis outside of football  and because he wasn t employed by mississippi state  his alleged      gift to lewis might well have been within the ncaa rulebook  welcome to college football  <BRK>still  the ncaa insisted on lewis  credibility  and pushed to keep him a part of it case against ole miss  at no point in time at the coi hearing or in   did any party   ncaa enforcement or lewis  lawyer   move to rescind lewis  statement in part or in whole  despite plenty of reason to do just that  lewis  statement were at time contradictory and his multiple payment from multiple school compromised enforcement s credibility <BRK>most importantly  lewis wa being sued by rebel rag for thing he said to the ncaa under an assumption he would be protected <BRK>there wa still plenty on the table to hammer ole miss with   over a half decade of sloppiness and pride  but here they were  forcing lewis to testify  in the middle of his season  with every word he uttered possibly going to be used against him in an actual civil trial <BRK>who wa the ncaa actually trying to protect here <BRK><BRK>after the september coi hearing  the ncaa blew past it normal window for delivery of a decision  ole miss played out it entire postseason sanctioned   season  including an egg bowl upset win over mississippi state in starkville  multiple party involved speculated that the ncaa purposefully withheld it decision until after the egg bowl to avoid it becoming a nationally televised storyline <BRK>the following week  on december    the decision came down  ole miss wa hit with an additional one year bowl ban  four year of probation  financial penalty  and an additional   scholarship removed  while not a death sentence  the name in college football circle when a program is suspended entirely   it wa a harsh punishment that would hinder ole miss  ability to compete in the sec <BRK>former asistant  including barney farrar   were hit with varying penalty but  in a strange twist  freeze received what wa perceived by many to be a slap on the wrist  the former ole miss head coach  ostensibly the biggest target of the entire investigation  wa handed a two game suspension to be served only if he became a head coach in the   seaon  a of now  it doesn t appear that that will happen <BRK>jeffrey vitter and ross bjork  held a press conference  vowing to fight back against the ncaa for touting their  exemplary cooperation  with the ncaa throughout the year long investigation <BRK>bjork hammered the enforcement staff <BRK> i think something happened  quite frankly  about a year and a half ago jut before the draft night of    the course of this investigation changed  the entire conduct went from one of cooperation to one where we were shut out  where information that should have been obviou to pursue  that we would have certainly noticed and followed up on  wa not  by the time the fact became known to u  that information wa no longer available becaue of the time sensitive nature  that is an example where we could have been led to an entirely different concluion on some very key matter  i really am very upset about the way this process wa conducted  it wa unfair  it wa not appropriate for our university or our student athlete  <BRK>basically  ole miss felt like they were lied to <BRK>in a conference call with medium  committee on infraction chair greg christopher did not acknowledge the conflict of interest by lewis and msu  nor the inconsistent view of the ncaa regarding the credibility of lewis  he did  however  chastise reporter who covered the case <BRK> the leak are  they re tough on the process  this is meant to be a confidential process to protect the institution and people involved  <BRK><BRK>nothing about what happened here ha changed anything about the mechanic of college football  there is only one lesson here  don t get caught  ever <BRK>and if you had a rooting interest for or against any person or program or institution in this story you can t be satisfied <BRK>if you believe the absolute worst about the ncaa   that they re profiteer of a free labor system who seek to punish anyone who undermines that process all while having the gall to pa off their scam a an educational enterprise   you can t be satisfied  the ncaa fake cop did whatever they could to shoehorn  manipulate  and omit information to fit a cae that wa rubber stamped by the ncaa s fake court <BRK>if you believe the absolute worst about hugh freeze   that he systematically orchestrated prohibited recruiting practice to further his career while posing a humble man of god   you can t be satisfied <BRK>sure  freeze wa fired by the rebel  but not for his role in the ncaa investigation  his two game suspension by the ncaa only applies if he s the head coach of a program in    and if you re naive enough to think the combination of the ncaa and phone sex scandal are enough to blacklist him from ever returning the same level in this industry  consider an april   report by al com that claim sec commissioner greg sankey had to intervene to keep multiple conference school from hiring freeze for various potential assistant job   including national champion alabama <BRK> i can confirm a a result of phone call with multiple source that freeze wa in contact with five different sec program for potential job  with at leat three of those school talking with him about potential on field asistant coaching position  not administrative or analyst job  <BRK>freeze will undoubtedly coach again  he will likely do so in the southeastern conference  and will likely become a head coach at a top program again in his career <BRK>if you believe the absolute worst about dan mullen   that he encouraged one of his player to act against their own self interest and rat out a rival school that had usurped his career momentum at mississippi state   you can t be satisfied  mullen saw no reprimand <BRK>far from it  le than a week after losing the egg bowl  mullen signed a six year     million deal with the florida gator  that dream job he reportedly always wanted  he now helm one of the strongest  most successful program in modern college football  after year of missing out on big job  he hired jimmy sexton   who also represents tunsil and freeze   a his agent <BRK>if you believe the absolute worst about mississippi state   that the program and it booster  poxed with little brother syndrome  schemed to help lindsey miller with legal counsel  funnel money to leo lewis  and encourage him and other msu player to talk to the ncaa about ole miss and rebel rag   you can t be satisfied <BRK>mississippi state s booster finish this story with an mvp stat line  they re the real winner  you can t help but applaud them  if you believe this version  bulldog booster should conduct paid clinic for other sec bagman  topic    how to launder recruiting inducement barred by the ncaa through family connection  topic    how to ratfuck your sloppy rival for fun and profit <BRK>and if you believe the absolute worst about ole miss   that a program and booster culture so desperate to win encouraged and orchestrated wanton prohibited recruiting scheme and then lied to cover them up   you can t be satisfied by the result  despite the shadow of the investigation and losing freeze day before starting practice  the rebel finished   with a respectable     record <BRK>a of this writing  the rebel    bowl ban still stand  also a of this writing  new head coach matt luke  a former ole miss player  is overseeing a   recruiting clas that currently rank  th in the nation  according to   sport <BRK>the   college football recruiting class from the state of mississippi is considered one of the deepest and most talented class in history  so what do you think is about to happen  what would stop all of this from happening again <BRK>mississippi is still football rich and money poor  booster still want to win and high school recruit still need their cash <BRK>this will keep happening  all of it  even the ncaa said the culture stretch over decade <BRK>nothing here ha changed  except  possibly  the life of leo lewis  before the   seaon  many in mississippi thought lewis would declare for the nfl draft at the conclusion of the year  that didn t happen  playing with an ncaa investigation and civil trial hanging over his head  lewis had his worst year a a bulldog  following a redshirt freshman seaon that saw him record   tackle in    he had just   this pat seaon  he will return to mississippi state in the fall  still the subject of a civil suit that could one day take away the honest money he doe make from football <BRK>about the t shirt <BRK>the rebel rag suit against leo lewis   kobe jones   and lindsey miller  is pending  and it s now added multiple new co defendant  including dan mullen   mike sheridan   and the ncaa <BRK>at the heart of this case is the matter of rebel rag and it official association with ole miss  which is in a holding pattern at the moment  the university of mississippi is preparing an appeal to the ncaa in hope of overturning it bowl ban and restriction on visit that recruit can make  meantime  the store is permitted to still maintain a business relationship with the school <BRK>if the ole miss appeal is denied by the ncaa  a most predict it will be  ole miss will have to disasociate from rebel rag indefinitely  per ncaa sanction  that mean no presence at ole miss event  no relationship with the athletic department  and no imprint on the campus  including at sporting event <BRK>if that
