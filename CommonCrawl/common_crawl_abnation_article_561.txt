kyler murray is probably one of the best athlete to ever be a college quarterback  he didn t run through the usual combine or pro day test  but he ha elite quickness  breakaway speed  and the arm to hit downfield target  not counting sack  he ran   time for     yard during his heisman seaon at oklahoma  with   touchdown  with sack yardage  he still ran for more than     yard  a he got sacked on just     percent of his pas attempt  he avoided a lot of contact  protecting himself with baeball like sliding skill <BRK>it wa rare for an opponent to get his hand on murray anywhere near the oklahoma backfield  he wa just too quick  the super athlete threw for     yard per attempt  with   touchdown and seven interception  combining his run and pass  he had   touch for     yard and   touchdown  at     yard per touch  that s roughly a first down per play  when he gave himself up to protect his body  he and the sooner still came out ahead  <BRK>here s how murray s system at oklahoma worked  how he operated in it  and what that can tell u about his potential to run an nfl offense going forward <BRK>in    when baker mayfield wa oklahoma s qb  the sooner  offense wa really diverse and multiple  they based out of a spread set with   personnel   two back  one tight end  with a full time flex te in mark andrew and a fb te hybrid in dmitri flower  <BRK>while andrew ran route from the slot  it wa flower  job to hang around the box a a blocker and constant pop pas threat  ou wa generally a spread to run team that mixed in play action shot  but a it young receiver developed  it added more drop back pases  sometimes  a third receiver replaced flower  <BRK>in    when murray took over  thing changed  ou returned multi year starter at three offensive line spot and plugged in a potential first rounder  cody ford  at right tackle and an elite recruit  creed humphrey  at center  but with andrew and flower gone and a blazing fast receiver corp having more experience  the sooner spread their offense out  <BRK>so  ou s strength were in murray s unique skill  the overall run game  and the receiver   ou had a lot of strength   <BRK>the sooner became even more of a play action oriented team  and murray wa great at making defense wrong  run scheme became that much more deadly  because murray could keep the ball and either hand it off  run it himself  or throw it  they still made time to take play action shot over the middle to their tight end and fullback    <BRK>   a well a a normal asortment of perimeter screen  while also mixing in more opportunity for murray to take deep shot off play action <BRK>murray throwing post route to marquise brown off play action wa one of the most explosive play in big   history  it go up there with robert griffin iii throwing to kendall wright off the power read and the post route tandem of mason rudolph and james wahington at oklahoma state  <BRK>part of what made the unit so special wa how long murray had to find receiver  between the distraction of the sooner run game  the superior blocking of the line  the seeming impossibility of successfully tackling murray  and his arm strength  he wa able to wait until the coverage downfield had devolved into man to man  then he could fire  <BRK>ou s passing play were designed to attack specific coverage and create simple read and one on one for murray to aim at  he wa le effective when his read wan t there  and when defense shifted late and forced him to re diagnose coverage after the snap <BRK>murray wan t always good in the pocket  and he relied on his elusiveness to open thing up  more than than he relied on making quick progression and read  but covering all of ou s receiver and beating that offensive line  then tackling murray  wa just too much  <BRK>oklahoma finished no    in offensive s p   no    in yard per play  and no    in a bunch of efficiency and explosiveness stats  it wa one of the best offense in history  <BRK>a key to the sooner  success wa that they stressed defense in two area at once  the line of scrimmage  via the run game and murray s leg  and deep coverage  via good pas blocking  murray s ability to move around  play action  and a bunch of skilled pas catcher   the scheme wa smart  and murray s ability made it devastating  <BRK>the first of ou s two loss wa against texa in the red river shootout  the longhorn played their       dime package  trying to cover up the deep shot and then rally to the run game  ou s three rb that day turned   carry into   yard   good  but not a explosive a usual  texa got enough red zone stop and turnover to squeeze out a win  despite murray accounting for nearly   yard and five touchdown  murray s so fat that even when your game plan is to stop the run  thing like this can happen  <BRK>in a rematch at the big   championship  texas played a       nickel and focused on stopping the run  trusting db to hold up in coverage down the field rather than flooding the deep field with athlete  this time  ou ran   time for just   yard  but murray threw for   yard and three score with no turnover in a playoff berth clinching victory <BRK>the last game of murray s college career wa the orange bowl semifinal against alabama  and nick saban opted for a mix of nickel and dime  he kept both safety deep more often than not  daring oklahoma to win by beating tighter coverage with quick route or beating a mammoth defensive line with the run and play action  <BRK>alabama played great defense at the outset and built a     lead with it own potent offense  but then murray started finding scrambling lane  making difficult throw  and hitting receiver way downfield  <BRK>alabama s defensive game plan ultimately failed a the pas rush wore down  murray threw for   yard while rushing for another    oklahoma s rb could only punish the tide for playing two deep to the tune of   carry for   yard  and ou didn t even really try to run them  but alabama couldn t keep murray under wrap  a he scrambled for yardage or time until the tide s deep coverage defaulted to one on one matchup  <BRK>alabama won  but murray carved up the defense  and oklahoma scored    unless a defense wa getting pressure on murray and clogging his scrambling lane  he d find a way to beat it either on the ground or through the air  he wa just too good an athlete  working in too much space <BRK>in college  it wa difficult to keep murray out of his comfort zone  it wa extremely difficult to corral him a a runner and hold up in the pas game against his arm  <BRK>murray had a clear command of how lincoln riley s extensive offense wa creating matchup for his top receiver  if you couldn t confuse him with disguise  he wa going to find those matchup and put the ball in spot where his target could make play  <BRK>the comfort zone for murray is where he can use his athleticism to boost the classic formula of using the run to set up the pas  it used to be that nfl team would accomplish that aim with tall  strong armed qbs who could see defense and fire in throw with perfect timing  but football s changed  the spread is everywhere and ha lessened the need for a taller  quick thinking gunner  murray s     stature is manageable  and his athleticism can open up option not available to every pro offense  <BRK>if the team likeliest to draft murray actually draft him  that s not so great a concern  what happens if the cardinal  kliff kingsbury can build a spread offense that us murray s athleticism to help create a power run game and then generates matchup down the field  <BRK>how much easier might life be for the cardinal  maligned offensive linemen if they can leave defender unblocked for murray to read in the option  what if the guy they re protecting is so quick that opponent can t catch him and wear down trying  what if murray s play action and rpo savvy keep linebacker frozen a second too long  too often  <BRK>then there s going to be another precedent people will need to become worried about  how do you stop that in the nfl  because we didn t see anyone do it in college <BRK>
