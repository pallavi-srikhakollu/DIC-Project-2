when the sixer swung the deal for tobias harris  the main reason were clear  it wa a win now move for a potential fourth star  a scoring force who is pouring in     point per game with a     true shooting percentage  both career high  indeed  in four game with philadelphia  harris ha produced the third highest average on the team  with     point per game on     percent true shooting  <BRK> but he s also been so much more  <BRK> if he wa just a scorer  giving up the number of asset  the miami first round pick  their own future first round pick  landry shamet  wilson chandler and mike muscala  too  wouldn t have been worth it  philadelphia s bench is already one of the thinnest in the league and thinning it even further demand a great deal of reasoning  <BRK> backing up the deal  then  is the secondary skill harris boat   such a defense and pasing  <BRK> a a cherry on top of philly s offense  per baketball reference  the sixer are already tied for ninth in offensive rating   harris ha the potential to create more impact defensively  by no mean is harris a lockdown defender  but he can fill in the hole of the  th rated defense  <BRK> through four game and   minute  the new starting five   one including harris at the power forward position   is boasting a staunch     defensive rating  though easy win against the lakers and knicks inflate those number  an improved defense should put a smile on fan  face  <BRK> before harris  arrival  the defense struggled with wilson chandler at power forward  lineup featuring chandler  in fact  surrendered   point per   possession  despite having a high basketball iq  chandler wa slowing down laterally   likely due to the hip surgery from the year prior   no area wa dealt a greater blow than his pick and roll defense  <BRK> in contrast  harris is spry  he switch onto guard   stepping over  screen with verve  or he bang down low in the paint  <BRK> harris is an upgrade over chandler defensively  but his impact could have a ripple effect throughout the team  too  <BRK> the  er team ha pick and roll issue   i ve reiterated this point   but most of the discussion ha revolved around the big man  who constantly  drop  too deep  there s a second part of the equation  though  that tends to be avoided  that is  the on ball defender  who struggle to get around the ball screen  <BRK> the two variable have equal weight and corresponding effect  the big man ha to make a decision on the distance he drop and when exactly he doe so  the guard defending the ball screen ha to decide to go over or under and which angle he take  either the guard or big failing his duty lead to an easy bucket for the offense  <BRK> through four game  harris ha shown to be a solid on ball defender in the pick and roll  this  in particular  take pressure off the big man   embiid in the first clip and boban in the second   who  a a result  gain solid rebounding positioning  <BRK> harris ha the intangible to be a solid pick and roll defender  he  rearview pursuit  and contest shot  <BRK> in all his stop  harris ha proven to be a functional cog in the team defense machine  but sixer coach will look to hone his individual defense over the remainder of the season  citing disappointing statistic  <BRK> harris is  th in defensive pipm        for player who have played in     or more minute  per bball index  that number  in comparison  is the same a brandon ingram  kyle kuzma  and wilson chandler  among others  shift the criterion to     minute and harris is  th in d pipm  offering a look at his particularly high volume and low defensive efficiency  <BRK> true to the statistic above  the bag ha been mixed in term of harris  individual defense in a sixer uniform  <BRK> take the game against the lakers on february    for instance  it wa an ugly one  kyle kuzma scored   point on   for   shooting when guarded by harris  according to nba com s matchup data  matchup statistic can be noisy  but the film offer damning evidence  <BRK> in transition  wherea kuzma attacked full head of steam  harris clumsily backpedaled  pause the film and watch a the cause effect situation unfolds  kuzma performed his patented euro step  causing harris to lose track  <BRK> kuzma s tear wan t a transition fad  either  but one visible in the half court  too  simply press the play button and watch a kuzma s burst of quickness leaf harris in the dust  <BRK> rewatch the other game  though  and you can begin to realize harris  potential a a versatile defender  <BRK> he limited marcus morris to eight point on   for   shooting  guarding center  noah vonleh and maon plumlee  harris held his own  a the two combined to score just five point on   for   shooting in   total recorded possession  <BRK> harris boat the build and iq necessary to become a defender  while still in need of improvement to reach it  offensively  on the other hand  his game is already refined  not only a a scorer  but a paser a well  which figure to take an even further leap a he continues playing with simmons  butler  and embiid  <BRK> after the     win over the denver nugget in harris  debut  harris told kyle neubeck of phillyvoice what it meant to be surrounded by the three star  <BRK>  i think when we go back and look at film of this game and even you can see from this game pocket in the game where you said  dang  this is something scary there   harris said after the game   i always knew the talent from afar  but going out and playing and seeing it today and seeing how much spacing we have on the court and playmaker  wa big   <BRK> in his short time with philadelphia  harris is recording     assist per   minute  the highest mark of his career  in which he s recorded     assist per   minute  <BRK> he s shown promising sign a a creator  here  he hang in the air while looking off the defense like a quarterback  before making  dump off pases  to post player  <BRK> it look like ben simmons isn t the only player on the sixer who can grab a rebound or catch the outlet pas and dribble down the court with an eye on both shooter and cutter  <BRK> that s not to say harris ha veered out of control in transition  knowing when to wreak havoc and when to play it safe  <BRK> in the half court  too  harris straddle the line of cautiousness and riskiness  keeping his head up regardless and finding just about anyone  <BRK>  <BRK> that is not to say harris is an all around creator and playmaker  plenty of improvement can be made when it come to making crisp pass and completing pass while limiting turnover  <BRK> with jimmy butler and ben simmons already in the starting lineup  it s important to note that harris might not even have many creating opportunity  nonetheless  it wouldn t hurt to have an extra creator in instance when the aforementioned pairing is off the court  <BRK> in the same way he ha stride to make a a paser  harris ha step to take a a defender  improving his attentiveness a off ball screen are set and lateral footwork on the ball are the next step for the eight year veteran  <BRK> if he can add subtle improvement to his game  though  the sixer will have their ideal fourth star and a fantastic complement to simmons  embiid  and butler through the rest of the season  <BRK> all statistic courtesy bball index  nba com  cleaningtheglass  and basketball reference  <BRK>
