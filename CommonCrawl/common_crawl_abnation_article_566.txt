manny pacquiao ha been talking a lot about floyd mayweather jr   and seems rather confident that he can beat him in a rematch of their   showdown  much of the talk prior to pacquiao s saturday bout against adrien broner ha been about mayweather and what come next  pacquiao han t shied away from the discussion  and he didn t after a dominant unanimous decision victory over broner  <BRK> after earning that victory  pacquiao wa asked if he wanted to fight mayweather  who wa in the building for the bout  <BRK>  floyd mayweather  co promoter here this evening  in the house  watching and assessing you  sometimes during the fight  do you want that fight   he wa asked  <BRK>  tell him to come back  from retirement  to the ring and we will fight   pacquiao said   i am willing to fight floyd mayweather again   <BRK> mayweather wa then aked if he would accept the fight  a they had a camera trained on him  he wa told that a  simple nod will do   the camera focused on him for about   second a mayweather didn t move his head an inch  <BRK> the   year old boxer and mayweather     went back and forth in  negotiation  about a potential bout for literal year before they met in    and it wa a hugely disappointing fight that many believed happened several year too late  in other word  both fighter were nearing the end of their career  though pacquiao seemed to have lost a step much more than mayweather  <BRK> a rematch  nearly four year after it wa already considered too late  isn t necessarily that appealing from a boxing standpoint but like it or not  they re still the two biggest name in the sport and such a rematch would make some serious money  both pacquiao and mayweather know that  <BRK> yes  probably  a much a i personally don t care about seeing these two fight so late in their career  i d rather they be fighting each other than either getting destroyed by or outboxing some of the younger talent in the sport s most competitive division s   i d rather they fight each other and highlight some of the other talent on the card  <BRK> pacquiao fighting broner made sense because broner is in a transitional period of his career  he wa once considered the future of boxing and after a loss to marcus maidana in    his career ha been downhill  at   year old  broner wa in exactly the right place to launch himself back into the elite level boxer discussion with a potential win over pacquiao  that fight made sense  a rematch with mayweather make sense  <BRK> of course  this is a man that captured world title in a record eight weight class over the span of two decade  and ha beaten some of the best there ever wa  his style is not one that ha any notable disadvantage against mayweather s style  pacquiao is a smart guy who know that he ha to change his gameplan   perhaps getting out to a quicker start than usual given how the first fight went   to hand mayweather that elusive loss  <BRK> you also have the fact that pacquiao simply looked great against broner  sure  he wa expected to win  but pacquiao looked fast and in shape that whole bout  <BRK> then you have the recent history of mayweather  who remains undefeated a a professional boxer but whose pat two  bout  were a publicity stunt against connor mcgregor  who is not a boxer  and a short  exhibition  against the young kickboxing prodigy  tenshin naukawa  that latter bout did not allow kicking  and almost asuredly would have went a different way if it did  the point is that mayweather is hardly being challenged at this point in his career  which is a weird statement to begin with a mayweather is  retired   for the third time   <BRK> that said  pacquiao ha at time looked good and at other time looked awful in recent fight  it s really hard to gauge where he s at with his talent right now  it wouldn t be the most shocking thing if he became the man to knock out mayweather  but it would be surprising if he out boxed mayweather for   round  <BRK> other than having to fork over what will probably be at least    to watch what will surely be more spectacle than sport  the biggest downside is the overlooking of amazing talent coming up in just about every weight class to see two legend  well past their prime  battle it out in what will probably be a sad reminder of the great bout we missed when these two were at their peak  <BRK> the bout simply ha little opportunity for excitement save for a surprise knockout  likely from pacquiao  that would be historic and shocking  and it would give mayweather  sitting at an official     for his career  a loss on his unblemished record  of course  that s a downside for mayweather  a i personally couldn t care le about mayweather s legacy  <BRK> and finally  there is the usual downside of older guy going at it and potentially doing serious harm to their brain or the rest of their body  people retire for a reason  and a pay day isn t always worth coming out of retirement for  <BRK>
