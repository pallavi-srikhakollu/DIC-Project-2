editor s note  this is now updated to include the three   dunk from the   slam dunk contest  <BRK> the nba slam dunk contest is usually the best part of all star weekend  since larry nance won the inaugural nba dunk contest in    the competition ha been a staple of the event  where fan could watch their favorite nba player try out dunk that couldn t be performed in game  and it appeared to have a formula that could never get old  the best nba player in the world trying to push the art of the dunk to new height   <BRK> but nope  it got old   <BRK> now this is my opinion  but the dunk contest hasn t really been the same since dwight howard stopped competing  the lone exception to this are when javale mcgee and blake griffin battled it out in    and when aaron gordon and zach lavine gave u one of the best dunk contest of all time in    but when you exclude those anomaly  it s easier to see that the contest  system  and formula are starting to age poorly  <BRK> since the the dunk contest came back in    david stern  gave it a rest  in   and     the league ha tried to switch and tinker with the contest to keep u interested   <BRK>    the dunk wheel  <BRK>     that weird freestyle round where everyone wa dunking at the same time  <BRK> through all of this  one thing hasn t changed  the highest possible score in the dunk contest is a    the   is how we immortalize some of the best dunk of all time  and these select dunk stand in a club high above the rest   <BRK> however  think of this   s club  a the baeball hall of fame  when you see all of these dunk  you ll realize that some are missing for random reaons and others somehow squeaked their way in  but  no one ha ever gone back and investigated which  s are better than others  <BRK> lady and gentleman  i have looked at every nba dunk contest perfect score with the sole purpose of rescoring and ranking them  not all  s were created equal and it s about time we rescale the best of the best  <BRK>

   <BRK> before we begin  i m going to explain the criterion that i used to score this contest  remember  this is my opinion and i m happy to be wrong on these  i just really wanted to spend two week charting dunk  <BRK> also remember  these new score are relative to the other dunk on this list and not the other dunk from the contest from which they came  imagine if all these dunk on the list were in the same contest  like a musical festival but with dunking  <BRK> this originality score compare the dunk in review to the other dunk up until it time frame  some dunk on this list are creative a hell  while others are paying homage or taking inspiration from earlier dunk and more specifically earlier  s  this way the dunk from older era won t get penalized for not holding up  for example  a windmill in the  s wa way more original than a windmill from   and this category will keep me from unfairly criticizing old dunk   <BRK> while some dunk might be similar or identical  not all dunker are the same  this criterion is designed to offset this factor  for example  a dunk for spud webb may be way more difficult to accomplish than a dunk from dominque wilkins because of their respective height  the degree of difficulty isn t only relative to the dunk  but to the dunker a well  <BRK> now the dunk is only half of the battle  there are so many other thing that factor into the overall excitement of a dunk  doe the crowd go crazy  doe kenny smith make up phrase  do the nba player jump onto the court  doe the dunker do some cool shit after  question like these factor into the overall dunk score  if you don t have the in person crowd feeling some type of way  then how exciting wa it really  <BRK> when you bring up a specific year  doe this dunk get mentioned  or wa it forgotten or lost in the shuffle with the other dunk from that same night  will we ever see this again  how did this dunk age over time  would it still get a high score today  wa this entire dunk contest forgettable  that s what this category is for   <BRK> i needed this to add up to    it s my list  leave me alone  say what you what about my method  but i think you ll be satisfied with the general result  this is my opinion and i want you to challenge me on some of these dunk  my opinion isn t the be all end all  not even close  i just wanted to make an immersive  enjoyable list  <BRK> the nba youtube channel made a video with every dunk  so you can use this a a guide  <BRK> now that you know all of the dunk  let s begin  we re starting from the bottom  <BRK>

   <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point   total score    <BRK>  look at year      wa this a mistake   kenny saying   spud webb did that dunk and he wa       i ve been watching this shit over and over  thinking that i missed something  but no  i m not  this is the most rim grazer package as dunk  and the sad part is that it s in    this is not even the most exciting dunk of that round  but it got a    this is a dunk that a lot of people do in high school basketball warmups  i have no idea what the judge were thinking here  fred jones had not one  but two better dunk in this competition alone  and that s what make this so sad  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point   total score     <BRK> this dunk didn t age a well a some of the other dunk of it era  i know it wa during the  s  but the fact that it didn t age well and can be replicated eaily by other dunker nowadays make it pale in comparison to the other  s on this list  i hope this seemingly harsh judgment make it clear that this list ha some tough competition   <BRK> he did make this look groovy a hell  tho   <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point   total score    <BRK> he doe another dunk eerily similar to this in the same  exact  contest  you ll see what i m talking about soon  <BRK>  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point   total score    <BRK> this wa at a point in time where we  a a society  couldn t seem to escape dj khaled and kevin hart no matter what we did  like i said lat year  this wan t the best dunk of the contest or mitchell s best dunk of the night  but then again  maybe dikembe mutombo wa in a good mood  <BRK> look again    oh yeah that s right  mutombo wan t a judge that year  this is the year where the nba thought it wa a good idea to have celebrity judge for the dunk contest   <BRK> again  i have no problem with mitchell winning overall  but this judging just killed the vibe  i m done talking about this dunk   <BRK>  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point   total score    <BRK> spud webb also doe a   dunk in this contest  but dominique ha a foot on webb so it look le impressive by comparison  wilkins is more known for his windmill anyway  no hard feeling  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point   total score    <BRK> i m from north carolina  so i felt proud of the kid being about to dunk over j  cole  however  if i judged the mitchell kevin hart dunk the way i did  i have to be fair  <BRK> carolina  stand up  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point   total score    <BRK> this would be way higher on the list if he didn t take so many attempt that it made raymond felton do this  <BRK> now  some people feel very strongly against vaulting  but i do love the fact that he actually vaulted over wade and then caught the ball  that s impressive in my book  dennis  please come back and do the dunk contest again   <BRK>  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point   total score    <BRK> at first glance  you might think that i m tripping with this dunk  the michael jordan sideways windmill is one of the most iconic slam in dunk contest history  you re absolutely right  but you re forgetting one thing  he pretty much did the same version of this dunk twice  in the same contest  the one you re looking at is the le impressive version and that s why it s so low on this list  <BRK>  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point   total score    <BRK> damn  josh smith really did three windmill variation in the same contest  wild  it feel like he only got a   because he wa in the wilkins jersey  now  for starter  i don t like how judge inflate these score just because you went to nba com and bought a jersey in advance   it ha to stop  so  since it is the least impressive of his windmill  it is the lowest scored of them on this list   <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point   total score    <BRK> i watched this   time to make sure i wan t missing something  this dunk did not age gracefully a it now look like something a   star recruit doe in warmups to impress the camera  this is a good dunk for that time  but it s not even the best dunk he did in the contest  it feel like this wa kind of a make up score   <BRK> the judging is all over the place in this contest and this dunk wa proof of that  i will say that he got very high up for this dunk  but this list is the best of the best  <BRK>  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point   total score    <BRK> the thing i ll give donovan mitchell on this one is that he punch and get this off way cleaner than his imitation vince carter dunk he did to close out the contest  i like mitchell s first dunk in the contest better   the one where he bounced the ball off a second basketball hoop   <BRK> that should have been a    <BRK> the wrong mitchell dunk got  s that night  which is a shame because the right dunk would have been pretty high on this list  <BRK>  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point   total score    <BRK> i m sorry  i can t get into this dunk for the life of me  the toss honestly doesn t look like it make a difference  to extend an olive branch  this helped influence some under the arm toss that we d see in later contest  stansbury wa trying his best to think outside the box  but this dunk ha not aged that well over time  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point   total score    <BRK> this seems pedestrian when compared to all the other stuff dwight howard ha done over the year  not his best work  but i get it  shoutout to howard being the only player from   and   to get  s in the dunk contest  nate robinson would have had some in my opinion  but fan voting got in the way   that s not a high   when you compare it to his other dunk  but it s a   on the regular nba dunk contest scale  <BRK>  oh hey  that s what this article is for  <BRK>  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point    total score     <BRK> this wa a first round dunk to avoid elimination  he ain t have to go hard  but he did and i respect it  <BRK> this dunk isn t pedestrian by any mean  it just didn t give me a much excitement a most of the dunk on the list  the dunk contest reached peak lull after dwight howard  it wa like there wan t going to be a show truly better than that for a time and everyone knew it  <BRK> this dunk contest will be known a the one after dwight howard  middle of the road  forgettable  this wa the year that we petitioned and demanded that shannon brown be in the dunk contest and he let u down  <BRK>  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point   total score    <BRK> shout out for attempting to replicate vince carter s dunk  but it doesn t get the same hype a    this go for anyone who try to do it  except paul george  who is the blueprint   vince got it off the cleanest  we re at a point with this dunk that every thing ha to be cleaner than a shamwow commercial for it to make an impact in dunk history  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty    excitement    timelessness   kofie point   total score    <BRK> when you look at the extension mason ha from right hand to left  we realize why this dunk got a    mason is also right handed  which make throwing down with his left all the more impressive  it s also a dunk that he attempted in   and couldn t stick  so prop to him for the perseverance  <BRK>  i like this dunk  i really do  however  this is a stacked list  so we have to grade accordingly  <BRK>  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point   total score    <BRK> a regular up and under dunk wan t nothing new to write home about when you look at this point in dunk history lore  but doing it off the bounce wa a nice way to liven it up  derozan is one of the best dunker in the league  and it s a shame he wa involved in the dunk contest lull that dwight howard created  he had solid dunk and did his best   <BRK>  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point     that wa a pretty high as lob  it look like he had to adjust to the pas  but still managed to slam  it home  prop  total score    <BRK> in a dunk contest with vince carter and tracy mcgrady  francis had good dunk and it suck these get lost in the shuffle  this isn t his best dunk in the contest in my opinion  but his last dunk got a   because vince carter wa jamming out of his mind  the   dunk contest wa all about vince carter  and it always will be  <BRK> sorry  steve  <BRK>  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point    <BRK> total score    <BRK> i m not the biggest fan of classic jersey dunk  but i do love this fake out by bridge  it s cool that we got numerous north carolina tribute in the   event in charlotte   <BRK>  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point     he s       total score    <BRK> this dunk is awesome  but the fact that the crowd doesn t know how to wild out yet is disappointing  it sound like a crowd for  the newlywed game  or something  it feel like they don t truly appreciate how hard it is to dunk when you re      while it sound like i m ripping on the crowd  they do get lively for his other dunk on the list  <BRK>  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point     measure height of a folding chair     yeah  make sense for the  s  i approve  total score    <BRK> this dunk helped pave the way for the jumping over shit dunk genre  dunk like this showed future contestant that prop raise the stake and danger level of dunk that would otherwise look pedestrian  these prop dunk help the audience and crowd calculate the athletic ability and difficulty of each dunk  <BRK> it s easier to imagine  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point     total score    <BRK> this is a great dunk for the  s  prop to you  jerome  throwing the ball from one side and catching it backward on the other side in that era get some credit from me  <BRK>  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point     back in the day  that s a fire as dunk  don t lie   total score    <BRK> dominique is known for the windmill  so dunk like these will always be remembered throughout the history of the contest  while the windmill ha evolved into so many different and better dunk  the fact that it s one of the original make this important   <BRK> oh shit  i basically said this earlier   <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point    total score    <BRK> we hadn t seen a double pump reverse with that much extension and air in the contest before  this wa very good execution by air jordan himself  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point   total score     if he couldn t see  but   if he could  <BRK> i refuse to believe that he did all this running up to the basketball without being able to see at least a little bit  the dunk wa too clean for me to believe that he wa  also he make a slight turn at the end of his run like  what   i m sorry y all  but you can t convince me that something isn t up  this is probably the hardest dunk i ve had to score because    if he really did it blindfolded  and    this dunk wa also during the scoring era that involved decimal  so getting a   in this time period wa extra impressive  in fact  from      this wa the only   given   <BRK> prop for playing the crowd and building up the hype  but i can t buy this   <BRK>  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point   total score    <BRK> dominique wilkins wa one of the original windmill specialist  the evolution of the windmill emphasizes just how important these earlier performance were for the future of dunking   <BRK> we will see a lot of windmill variation on this list and this one is instrumental to dunk history  but this is the highest i ll give it  again  nothing against him  that s just what happens   <BRK>  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point     this is incredibly toughtotal score    <BRK> this is one of the best dunk that he did  and also the one with the least amount of prop  yes  i remember the singing and the black panther mask more than his actual dunk  but in term of dunk  this wa really good  unfortunately for him  this wa the dunk contest where zach lavine stole the show and virtually nothing else mattered  <BRK>  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point     he had to use the dumb as dunk wheel and follow those rule  total score    <BRK> windmill are commonplace by the year    but good god he punch this  he also ha the benefit of nba player in early  s fashion losing their collective shit in the background for some extra excitement point  <BRK>  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point     he didn t even need to do this dunk  coulda played it safe  but he s a real one  total score    <BRK> this is a dunk similar to mcgrady s in    but he doe finish with one hand  so it separate itself just enough  he also didn t need to go this hard on this dunk since he only needed   to pas  but he decided to put on a show  i like it  <BRK>  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point     the elevation  the way he punch this dunk in  the reaction  total score    <BRK> he used this dunk to finish the round with a perfect   total  it s still wild that fred jones somehow won in     <BRK>  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty    excitement    timelessness   kofie point   total score    <BRK> speaking of fred jones  i didn t understand how good this dunk wa until i saw the extension this man make  this is a tough dunk  now  i m still mad at the judge for that other dunk that somehow got a    but hey  this one is the superior dunk and deserves it score  <BRK>  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point   total score    <BRK> this dunk only get docked a much a it doe because it s very similar to the dunk aaron gordon did with the macot hoverboard  which we will see later on in this list  <BRK>  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point   total score    <BRK> glenn robinson did his best to make an underwhelming dunk contest good    wa the year after gordon lavine so the general population wa going to think this contest wa underwhelming  <BRK>  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point     look at the vert  come on  total score    <BRK> if he wa in another era where dunk creativity wa more advanced  i m sure he d have some way cooler dunk and that s scary  the bounce would ve been put to good use in later dunk contest  <BRK>  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point   total score    <BRK> the only possible deduction i have for this dunk is that dr  j did this dunk in    and   in the aba dunk contest   <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point   total score    <BRK>  i ll give josh smith this  having the person sitting down throw you the lob wa pretty good  and completing a windmill off of that  that s dope  i think people briefly forget about him winning this dunk contest  but it s not like   ayo  you remember when fred jones won the dunk contest   <BRK> i might be off base  it might be the angry piston fan in me that mask all the good memory josh smith had in the league  either way  good dunk  <BRK>  <BRK> originality    degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point   total score    <BRK> we have to remember that he is      and he did this in a very forgettable dunk contest  <BRK>  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point   total score    <BRK> look how high this man get off the ground  good lord  <BRK>  <BRK> originality    degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point   total score    <BRK> this dunk is so good that we forget that deandre jordan did an identical version of this dunk the year before  the difference here is in the height and the fact that he got it off cleanly  <BRK> this wa the best dunk in a contest marred by bad celebrity judging and kevin hart being in the area  i m glad smith jr  s grandmother convinced him to participate again because i wouldn t have done it again  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point   total score    <BRK> so this dunk is a disciple of the andre igoudala dunk  i personally think that he doe it better than iggy  but that s why the originality is a little on the lower side  this is the year where it wa zach lavine and basically no one else  so the timeless part will have to take a slight  especially when you compare the contest to    it s truly not fair   <BRK>  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point    total score    <BRK> when i first watched the nba youtube video montage  i thought that jordan s   free throw line dunk showed up on the video twice on accident  nope  he did the same dunk  in the same contest  and got the same score  the final round dunk is better  but they re so identical that you can only tell them apart via instant replay  <BRK>  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point   total score    <BRK> again  he s      <BRK> something of note is that he got the crowd out of their foot with this one  spud webb is my favorite dunker and honestly i d let my bias show and give all his dunk   if i wasn t trying my best to be fair  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point   total score    <BRK> prop to him doing this dunk a full decade before lavine did  but lavine s wa way cleaner  this go to show that even though iggy wan t a much of an entertainer a robinson wa  he still excited u with his dunk  now  you can say he got robbed  but i jut think that nate robinson took better advantage of the system that wa in place  which wa infinite time to dunk and more time to try out even crazier shit  i m not saying i m for that format  but i m not going to sit here and pretend that watching nate robinson try to lob the ball between his leg from half court wan t fun  <BRK>  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point   total score    <BRK> this dunk came out of nowhere and the lack up of run up caught u all by surprise  it s similar to richardson s dunk  but the lack of run up and fact that he s a big man more than make up for it  <BRK>  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point   total score    <BRK> a far a memory serf  this dunk will probably take a backseat to him wearing his dad s jersey  and that s a shame   <BRK> this reminds me of the dwight howard volleyball style dunk that isn t on this list because of fan voting   <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point   total score    <BRK> mcgrady and vince carter were cousin and teammate in the same dunk contest  so that s fucking cool  mcgrady had a strong overall performance in   a well   people forget that  he would have won in   percent of the other year  in my opinion  <BRK>  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point   total score    <BRK> j rich is probably the best two foot  between the leg dunker in nba history  this man wa in his third contest and still brought the heat to the contest  he also did this in low sock   <BRK>  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point   total score    <BRK> because of the lack of big name in this dunk contest  it s easy to overlook great dunk like this  ross did his best  but holy crap this dunk contest wa mediocre  <BRK>  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty  excitement   timelessness   kofie point   total score    <BRK> anyone that s followed jones jr  through ballislife and hoopmixtape knew what he wa  capable of coming into the contest  he did not disappoint  <BRK>  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point   total score    <BRK> he wa wearing them  s as knee pad  you know the one that look super painful now  anyway  wilkins wa able to recover from his not good timing and wa still able to turn this into an explosive dunk  prop   <BRK>  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point   total score    <BRK> the toss wan t perfect  but iggy made an amazing catch and finish  again  he would have won the dunk contest that year if there wa a true time limit  this also helped pave the way for some other behind the backboard dunk that we ll see later in time  some we ve already seen on this list  there s always something exciting about a dunker clearing space behind the backboard  because you know that some shit is about to go down  <BRK>  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point   total score    <BRK> if that s not spud webb  there would be a bonus point deduction because that s really the only good choice  the nba dunk contest is a competition where nostalgia win and it doesn t get more nostalgic than that  iggy may have better dunk  but nate had crowd control and creativity  that s why he won   <BRK> don t just wear the jersey of the dunker that inspires you  bring that man out  don t wear the purple vince carter jersey   bring out vince carter  doing a poor man s version of a classic dunk with that dunker s jersey on is just disrespect in my eye  <BRK>  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point   total score    <BRK> gerald green got up on this and reacted so nonchalantly  i think the cupcake dunk wa amazing and more creative  but this is tough to do  green is one of the best leaper this league ha ever seen and that s what stand out no matter what dunk he doe  incredible  <BRK>  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point   total score    <BRK> it s in the   dunk contest  so the timelessness bar is set pretty high  <BRK>  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point    <BRK> total score    <BRK> glenn robinson wan t expected to win this dunk contest  but he came with the heat and silently won the thing  this is the same dunk contest where aaron gordon brought out a drone  but couldn t finish the dunk  he wa also coming off of an injury   so we ll live with this  <BRK>  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point   total score     for now  <BRK> this dunk is awesome because diallo is posing a superman dunking over shaq  who go by superman a well  we need to let this dunk simmer for a year before we give it the full timelessness score  but there is potential for this one to be an all timer  he didn t go full superman uniform like dwight did  yet he made this dunk his own  respect  <BRK>  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point   total score    <BRK> the thing about zach lavine s dunk is that they re all variation of each other  but those variation would all get  s in the traditional dunk contest a it stand  you can look at all of them and say   they re just good dunk   they aren t over the top and laced with prop  but rather just about the dunk themselves  that s what ha separated him from most other competitor  it s not his need to go over the top and try to do the most that make him great  it s the fact that he really doesn t have to do that  <BRK>  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point     man did it in high sock and short short  total score    <BRK>  dr  j did this in the aba dunk contest in    but i m not talking about that  that s why there s a   for originality   <BRK> looking back  the monotone announcer and the flatline crowd really take some of the air out of it  it sound like he s narrating a super old cartoon that s on at the same bat time and same bat channel  this suck because this is a very impressive dunk  the crowd wa just too whack to realize it  <BRK>  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness    kofie point    total score    <BRK> michael jordan basically repeated a dunk in the   nba dunk contest  but it s a super hard dunk and he did it well both time  i guess i ll allow it  this is what went on bedroom poster  this is what made everyone be like mike  so i m sorry that i say this is the more iconic dunk  but for the longest time i thought jordan did it first  you know why  because this is more iconic than dr  j s free throw line dunk  <BRK> fight me  i scored them both the same anyway  <BRK>  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point   total score    <BRK> god  he s so damn good  the longer that dunk off with aaron gordon went on  the more likely lavine wa going to win  because he can just do shit like this  <BRK>  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point   total score    <BRK> see above  it s the same thing  zach lavine ha a special style  and that s get a    <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point   total score    <BRK> this dunk ha since evolved  but vince carter wa breaking out the bag of trick like it wa nothing  it s been expanded upon by dunker like blake griffin in   and now professional dunker all over the world  honestly  if you think this one deserves a higher score  i won t even argue with you  the crowd reaction wa more shock than excitement and seemed milder than his other dunk in    but this is still a great dunk overall  <BRK>  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point   total score    <BRK> jaon richardson is one of the best two foot leaper the game ha ever seen  the explosiveness paired with nba player in   fahion losing their shit is a iconic a it get  you even had air jordan looking up like  damn that wa dope  <BRK>  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point   total score    <BRK> this wa the dunk off  so he wan t even planning to do this one  that s what make the dunk off so riveting  lavine and gordon weren t expecting to have to do these  but they were still head and shoulder above most of the dunk seen in dunk contest history  that s why it s so high   <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement    timelessness   kofie point   total score    <BRK> the man is      y all  and he s perfectly timing bounce with enough air to do a reverse  that s incredible  i know we seem lenient to shorter people in the dunk contest  but the stuff he s doing at that height is so damn impressive  especially in that era  if you ak me  spud webb is the reaon why a lot of the big men in the dunk contest strived to step their game up and i think that s what pushed player like dwight howard and javale mcgee to do dunk that only they can do  because if a guy a foot shorter can do the same dunk a you  then your dunk just look le impressive  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point   total score    <BRK> he s wearing a cape  now  is this a dunk that another bouncy big man can do  maybe  however  the show  paired with the spectacle and the hype the built up around it more than make up for that fact  we don t think about who else can do this dunk  because no one could possibly make it look better than dwight howard in a superman costume  <BRK>  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point   total score    <BRK> this is a dunk only a few people can do  dwight howard did a phenomenal job using his physical attribute to do dunk that no one else would dare attempt and he made this look easy  the fact that he wa taller made this a harder dunk  because his head wa on the other side of the backboard when he dunked it  only like   percent of the league can do that  and then you add a windmill to it  come on  <BRK> i just wanted to take the time to honor some of my favorite dunk that didn t get a   because of fan voting and some underrated dunk that just didn t get a perfect score  enjoy  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness    kofie point   total score    <BRK> vince carter may have not invented the windmill  but dammit he had the cleanest windmill in the history of basketball  this is art  he make this dunk look so damn easy and the celebration and crowd reaction on top of that  man  i know paul george did this dunk in game and everyone lost their shit  but it s not the same  every time someone try to do this dunk now it doesn t compare to vince  <BRK> even if you try to wear the iconic purple vince jersey  you re just making a fool of yourself at that point  there is only one vinsanity  <BRK>  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point   total score    <BRK> this dunk is special for a few reason  from everyone shouting to steve nash just being there  it s one of the few time where a missed attempt got people even more excited for the dunk  and it s also one of the few time a partner start the dunk without the ball  so we had no idea what wa happening  this is just a great dunk  josh smith may have won the whole contest  but amar e won the night  this is the dunk people remember   <BRK>  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point   total score    <BRK> forget about the tape he put down on the court  the pure showmanship and hype about this dunk is masterclass  the moment he take off his jersey and put on that cape  the fan go wild  dwight had been putting on a show all night long and the fan were ready for more  you can complain about the fact that he threw it in  but just being in a position to throw it in and still make it is incredible  and he got it on the first try  <BRK>  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point     it s over  lady and gentleman   total score    <BRK> the fact that cousin tracy mcgrady and vince carter were both in the dunk contest at the same time a teammate helping each other is incredible  the celebration and swagger afterward also make this one of the best dunk contest moment of all time  even the judge hop over the table to congratulate him  that s crazy  <BRK> also in the interview  he say that is the first time he s ever done that in his life  what  <BRK>  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point   total score    <BRK> say what you want about javale mcgee  this man showed up with some of the most creative dunk the contest ha ever seen  this one is a great showcase of creativity  knowing what you can do  and hype buildup  kudos javale  <BRK>  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point   total score    <BRK> the goofiness of the mascot make the dunk so much better  when aaron gordon did this dunk  i had seen it before by a professional dunker  but i m only comparing the originality to other nba dunk in the dunk contest  everyone went crazy after this  the mascot who probably couldn t see shit even went wild  this wa the best dunk in the best dunk contest  <BRK>  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point   total score    <BRK> people were still mad at aaron gordon s no    that we really glossed over this  zach lavine is the best one foot dunker to ever touch the contest  he took off from where many nba player attempt the free throw line dunk  and went between his leg a well to walkoff with the trophy   the dunk wa so good it almost made u forget that kevin hart wa saying word over it  almost  <BRK>  <BRK> originality   degree of difficulty   excitement   timelessness   kofie point   total score    <BRK> we ll probably never see this dunk again and that s because the fad of hoverboards will go away  the timing of this dunk  the tension that came about a gordon pretended to dunk  but then the macot started spinning  this is the perfect dunk contest dunk  and there probably won t be another because those hoverboard thing kept catching on fire  <BRK>  <BRK>
