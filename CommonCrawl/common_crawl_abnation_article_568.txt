   <BRK> most sportbooks do not offer this kind of refund in part because bad call are part of the gamble you make when you bet on sport  however  this is not the first time a sportbook operator ha offered a payout or refund a a way to generate some good publicity  <BRK> fanduel paid out all future bet on alabama to win the national title after they won the sec championship game  this came over a month before a national title game they lost  and even before they had even played the cfp semifinal game  fanduel said it would cost them      in straight up bet  and up to      in bet that parlayed alabama winning the national title  <BRK> fanduel said they did this because   it wanted to reward it customer for betting on a team with odds that actually difficult to win money   alabama wa a heavy favorite at all sportsbooks for much of the season  and particularly heading into the cfp playoff  <BRK> so why did fanduel do this with alabama  and why is pointsbet doing this for the saint loss  both have entered a quickly growing sport betting market in new jersey   one of eight state that currently allows sport betting  a the market saturates with new operator  each one is looking for a way to stand out from the crowd  online sportbook operator already offer bonus for joining them  and will continue to do so given the regularly high return for the house  fanduel and pointsbet are taking this to another level in hope of building a loyal following willing to hand over their money on a regular bais  <BRK>
