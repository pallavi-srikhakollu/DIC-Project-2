it s nba all star selection time and once again i ve been asked to cast an official vote that will be reflected in the medium portion of the formula used to select the starter from each conference  like the fan and player  the medium ha been tasked with picking five player from each conference with two backcourt and three frontcourt slot  <BRK>having an indirect influence over league business is not a comfortable position to be in  but it s a responsibility i take seriously  in addition to hour spent watching basketball every night  i ve pored over stats and talked to trusted league source when making my pick  <BRK>most of these pick were relatively easy  a few were painfully hard  i d gladly trade one of the backcourt spot in the east for another frontcourt opening in the west  but that s how it go  <BRK>a a reminder  the fan vote count for   percent with the medium and player vote accounting for   percent each of the final tally  once the starter are chosen  the coach will pick the reserve  <BRK>here are the actual all star starter pick <BRK>

  <BRK> antetokounmpo wa named an all star starter and a captain  <BRK>kawhi leonard  thanks to his seamless transition with toronto  it s been eay to forget about kawhi  to review  he s averaging career high in point     and rebound       along with a    true shooting percentage and all defense caliber work for one of the best team in the league  there is an open question in toronto a to whether the raptor are relying too much on leonard  but that s something to smooth out in the second half of the seaon  <BRK> leonard wa named an all star starter  <BRK>joel embiid  where doe embiid rank among the league s top center  he s no worse than top three  along with anthony davis and nikola jokic  and probably top two when you consider defense  along with ad   there s no debate about the best center in the east  however  the sixer are weird  but embiid remains their anchor on both end of the floor  <BRK> embiid wa named an all star starter  <BRK>james harden  the defending most valuable player ha been even better this season  racking up an efficient     point to go with     assist and a usage rate over    harden s blitzkrieg is the singular reason why the rocket have been able to recover from the slow start and secure solid postseason positioning  he s going to need some help if the rocket are able to make another playoff run  but there s no stopping him right now   <BRK> harden wa named an all star starter  <BRK>steph curry  is it possible for a two time mvp with three championship ring to be underrated  steph may never approach his twin mvp season again  but he s still the league s top shotmaker and most dangerous outside shooter  put it another way  if you had your pick of any guard in the league  are you really passing on curry  <BRK>note  apology to damian lillard  who ha reached a level of consistent excellence that still get taken for granted   <BRK> curry wa named an all star starter  <BRK>nba news and link delivered to your inbox each weekday  so you never miss out <BRK>anthony davis  the nba s best big man is averaging   and   with almost double his previous career high in assist at     per game  ad s defensive impact is a little tougher to quantify  defense is what s holding new orleans back in the standing  but when ad is on the court  the pel defend at about a league average rate  that won t help him win defensive player of the year  but there s no doubt he s an all star starter <BRK> paul george  and not davis  wa named an all star starter  the two finished in a tie  but george had more fan vote  earning him the tiebreaker  <BRK>kevin durant  now this get hard  there are simply too many frontcourt player having monster season in the west  there s a couple of different way this can go  but i m going to maintain an uneasy status quo  consider kd  who ha done nothing to lose his all star spot  he s averaging       and is creeping up on a       season  if he s not the best player in the world  then he s no worse than second   <BRK> durant wa named an all star starter  <BRK>lebron james  and if kd isn t the best player in the game  it s still this guy  the difficult part is that lebron ha missed   game and counting with a groin injury  it s the most he s missed at any point in his career and i came very close to replacing him with either nikola jokic or paul george  both the joker and pg are deserving of all star starter status  i simply can t get past not voting for lebron  especially given his work in the   game he did play before the injury  <BRK> james wa named an all star starter and a captain  <BRK>
