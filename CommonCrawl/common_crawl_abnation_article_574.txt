if you just care about the pick and nothing about the explanation  then this can be a short read   <BRK> here s my full bracket   <BRK> if you re looking for a justification of these soon to be largely incorrect prediction  then i m willing to play ball   <BRK> is there anyone outside of east lansing who doesn t have duke coming out of the east  the blue devil would have been the heavy favorite in any draw they could have received  but this route seems like it will provide especially little resistance   <BRK> point guard justin robinson is expected to be back for virginia tech  which help the hokies take down upset minded liberty in the second round and advance to the sweet    the flame advance to the second round with the token     upset of mississippi state that everyone see coming   <BRK> in the bottom half of the bracket  let s ue some recent trend to help u pick who s going to advance   <BRK> at leat one at large team from the first four ha won at leat one game in the main draw of the tournament since the advent of the first four in    that trend hold in   a the winner of temple belmont  probably belmont  take care of an lsu team that ha too many distraction to make it out of the first weekend   <BRK> everyone love the top two line of this year s tournament  and with good reason  the top eight team in college basketball appear to be vastly superior to the rest of the country  even so  at least one   seed ha been knocked out before the second weekend of   of the last   tournament  i ll take that stat  couple it with the fact that recent year have all seen a middling team from the acc that wasn t particularly well thought of heading into the dance get hot and win a couple game  and predict that louisville beat michigan state for the second time this season and march on to the sweet     <BRK> in the elite eight we get the  sexy  rematch of the duke miracle comeback game from february  round two is far le interesting  a the blue devil beat louisville by a billion and move on to minneapolis   <BRK> the west typically wind up being the region where thing get crazy  and the potential is certainly there for that to be the case again in     <BRK> let me start off by saying this  i am not a gonzaga hater  i think the zag are really  really good  and even labeled them a the team most likely to win the national title three week ago  having said all that     syracuse doe funky thing to really good team in march  it s the zone  the zone lie to you  it trick you  it make you believe you re something you aren t   <BRK> if gonzaga can figure out the zone in round two   or better yet  if baylor beat syracuse in round one   i think they ve got a terrific shot to win the region  i m predicting that they won t  and that people who thought the zag were a fraud all year will feel irrationally vindicated  i don t like it  but march is cruel   <BRK> marquette and florida state both get pushed in the first round by really good double digit seed  but eventually make it to the second round in one piece  the seminole  size and superior defense carry them past markus howard and the golden eagle   <BRK> thing get crazy at the bottom  where northern kentucky take care of trendy final four pick texas tech in the first round and open thing up for buffalo  nevada  a trendy final four pick themselves heading into the season  win a     game for the second straight year and march on to the sweet     <BRK> the wildest march madness fact currently going is that at leat one team seeded no    or worse ha made the final four in every year since    i don t think that trend hold in    but i do think we come close  buffalo take care of nevada and then stuns florida state to become the second mid major in a many seaons to crah the seaon s final weekend   <BRK> until virginia prof it can carry it regular season success over into march  their region is the one people are going to get the most creative with when it come to picking a champion  i think this is finally the year that happens  the cavalier have a fairly friendly draw  and the ghost of madness past seem to be the only thing that could keep them from playing their way into at least the second weekend   <BRK> everyone seems to like oregon over wisconsin  which mean the badger are going to get the job done and stop the red hot duck in round one  the upset that doe happen is right below them  where uc irvine   which rolled through the big west tournament   take care of a kansa state that will likely be playing without star dean wade  or at least without a   percent dean wade    <BRK> chalk reign supreme in the bottom half of the bracket until villanova s pedigree kick in and the wildcat pull off a second round upset of third seeded purdue  jay wright and company pull an even bigger upset two day later against second seeded tennessee   <BRK> it only feel right that virginia s  getting over the hump  moment come against the program that wa previously the most synonymous with  not being able to win the big one   the cavalier take care of villanova in the elite eight  and tony bennett and wright share an extended handshake where both look equally handsome   <BRK> here s another region where everyone love the     upset  but not enough people are paying attention to the      while the   seed get the most love for their cinderella effort   at least one   seed ha won a game in the tournament in eight of the last   year  it happened twice last year  and it s happening twice again this year  northeastern  a team that dealt with injury for much of the season but is healthy now and perfectly fit the profile of a march cinderella  take care of kansa and put an end to the bizarre season of the preseason no      <BRK> after hanging triple digit on iona in round one  book it   north carolina get a tougher than expected test from utah state in the second round  the heel make the play necessary to avoid a massive upset there  and then run away from sec champion auburn in the sweet     <BRK> kentucky get a similar scare from fletcher magee and wofford in the second round  but ultimately advance to the sweet   for the sixth time in seven season  there they hammer iowa state  a bipolar team with load of talent that seemed to find it footing last week in kansa city  the cyclone upset houston   which deserved a friendlier draw   in round two before running into the wildcat buzz saw   <BRK> the rematch that everyone want to see in the regional final happens  a kentucky beat unc for the second time this seaon in dramatic fahion  the role from   are reversed a keldon johnson splahes a jumper in luke maye s face just before the final horn   <BRK> buffalo keep thing interesting against duke for approximately five minute before reality set in  virginia frustrates kentucky all night long with it pack line defense and win a brutally uneventful game that america hate   <BRK> round three between duke and virginia go the same way the first two round went  a the blue devil are in control of a competitive enough game from start to finish  and wind up winning by a comfortable margin  zion williamson and company cement their legacy a one of the most memorable team in recent college baketball history  <BRK>
