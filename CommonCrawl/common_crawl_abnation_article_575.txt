the philadelphia eagle made a headline grabbing move to open the   league year when they traded for buccaneer wide receiver desean jackson  who wa originally drafted by the eagle in    on the surface level  it s a deal that made sense for both side  philadelphia needed more explosive playmaker on offense  while the bucs needed to trade jackson to alleviate cap space for the free agency period  <BRK>jackson is a big name player who had big time moment with the eagle in the six season he played for them from      after leaving the eagle  jackson spent three season with washington and then two season with tampa bay   all five of those season away from philadelphia were up and down  <BRK>while the   year old still ha a lot to offer an nfl offense and it wa a good idea for the eagle to add weapon for a quarterback on a rookie deal  it might not be a perfect match for philadelphia and carson wentz  jackson can still take the top off of a defense  but he might not be entering the best situation for a player of his specific talent   again <BRK>jackson ha been one of the most dangerous deep threat in the nfl since he entered the league in    he thrives on getting open deep down the field and outracing defensive back to the end zone  for his career  jackson rank  th all time among qualifying receiver at     yard per reception  yet even with his proven track record  he never really jelled well with bucs quarterback jameis winston <BRK>winston isn t exactly one of the best deep thrower in the league  and it s the main reason why he and jackson couldn t connect deep down the field  according to sport info solution  winston had a passer rating of     on throw that traveled at least   yard in the air  that ranked  th out of   passer with at least   attempt where the ball traveled   yard in the air <BRK>here s an example of his shaky accuracy from the buccaneer  first game against the falcon last season  <BRK>jackson isn t wide open  but a decent throw would still allow him to make a play on the ball  instead  winston sail the ball deep down the field where it wa intercepted by damontae kazee  jackson never had a chance to catch the ball considering winston overthrew him by four or five yard <BRK>winston struggled to throw route that typically develop down the field  on post  deep crossers  and go route  winston had a passer of      that ranked  th out of   passer that had at least   attempt on these type of route <BRK>even with winston s issue throwing the deep ball  jackson wa able to have a productive season down the field   thanks to help of ryan fitzpatrick  fitzpatrick had a passer rating of     on these deeper throw  which ranked sixth in the league out of the   passer with at least   attempt  he and jackson were absolutely torching team to start the season   including the eagle  over the first two week of the season  fitzpatrick completed all nine of his attempt to jackson for a ridiculous   yard and three touchdown  <BRK>fitzpatrick and winston took turn taking start throughout the season and jackson s production fell off  after torching the eagle for   yard and a touchdown in week    jackson only had one more   yard game and one more touchdown in the final   game that he played  he only ended up catching two touchdown from winston over the   game he played in tampa <BRK>while getting away from winston is likely a good move for jackson a he enters the tail end of his career  the quarterback he s going to might not be the best fit for him either <BRK>wentz didn t exactly light it up on deep throw last season  either  on throw that traveled   or more yard in the air  wentz actually had a worse passer rating than winston  wentz s passer rating on those throw wa      which ranked  th out of the   quarterback with at least   throw that traveled   yard in the air <BRK>wentz ha been a hot and cold deep thrower throughout his entire career so far  a a rookie in    wentz had a paser rating of     on pases that traveled   or more yard in the air  in    that paser rating jumped all the way up     before falling down this year  it could be that there s just an inherent randomness to being a good deep paser given the difficulty and precision of the play  but there are some thing on the field that wentz can clean up to help him out <BRK>it s not the physical ability wentz lack  like winston  wentz is prone to making some silly mistake when throwing down the field  this interception from the eagle  game against the jaguar is a perfect example  jalen ramsey doesn t have any immediate threat in coverage  so he rotates towards the middle of the field where he can intercept wentz   who doesn t even see him <BRK>here s another example from the eagle  regular seaon game against the saint  wentz doesn t see marshon lattimore undercutting the deep route before he pick it off  the ball wa underthrown a well <BRK>the caveat with wentz s number compared to winston s is that winston wa throwing to better receiver last year  mike evans  desean jackson  and chris godwin are a bit more of a formidable trio  at least going deep  than alshon jeffery  golden tate  and nelson agholor <BRK>even with sporadic quarterback play  jackson ha proven he can still a formidable deep threat   he might be able to help correct some of the issue with wentz s deep ball a he make his return to pennsylvania <BRK>philadelphia is continuing it quest to surround it young  franchise quarterback with talent that will allow him to continue to grow into one of the top quarterback in the nfl  on paper  it might not look like the best marriage of quarterback and receiver  but jackson doe give the eagle a dynamic they didn t have last year  speed  speed  and more speed  <BRK>
