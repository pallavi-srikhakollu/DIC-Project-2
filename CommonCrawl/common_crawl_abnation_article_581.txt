if you spend any amount of time on college basketball twitter during the month of february and march  you will inevitably encounter someone doing their best comic book guy impersonation when discussing the at large pool  <BRK> i know  i know   the bubble picture seems particularly mediocre this year  thanks to the pac   being nearly absent from it  the non marquette villanova membership of the big east seemingly conspiring to all go     in conference play  the big ten s bottom displaying a pulse more regularly  and some unexpected mediocrity in the sec  horror of horror  we even have team from such power conference at the atlantic sun and socon threatening to secure second bid  whatever will we do   <BRK> for starter  we ll calm down a bit  next  we ll realize that this will be the ninth season of a   team ncaa field with a first four  yes  it wa all the way back in   when vcu made it famous run from dayton to the final four in houston  and with the field still requiring three additional team from the   team bracket that wa in place from      inviting some team with nit type profile is a necessity each year   <BRK> our collective memory also seems to be a bit short on this topic  based on the number of at large team selected with double digit loss   admittedly not the most complex metric i could have selected   we live in a particularly dour time in ncaa tournament history  just last season    double digit loss team earned at large  that s only one fewer than   s all time record of    the third place total     came all the way back in        in fact  looking at the last four season  only   s total of   double digit loss at large selection fall outside of this pattern   <BRK> and after examining the number of   at large contender that have seven or more loss with a month to go  look for this season s field to also feature   or so team heading into the tourney with   or more defeat   <BRK> an awful bubble is just a fact of life now  eat at arby s  <BRK> changing the subject for a moment  i m ready to hand out some lock at the top of the bracket  to be considered a  lock   a team ha to be in strong enough position to earn a bid  even if they lose each and every one of their remaining game  a a result  these don t necessarily match up with the seed list and i ll call out exception a they appear   <BRK> a a reminder  you ll see three set of number in parenthesis after each at large candidate  name  the first is it overall record in game against division i opposition only  the second is it total of group   and    quality  win  with the third indicating the number of group   win  since the selection committee ha indicated that it value these the most   <BRK> note  while team record reflect game played through thursday  feb        the group

 purdue  since the boilermakers still have seven regular season game and at least one big ten tournament game left  while they ve likely done enough up to this point  an unlikely eight game skid would make them     and that could be too close for comfort  <BRK> this grouping see several change from tuesday s bracket  which followed the committee s sneak preview guidance  for starter  kansa and north carolina flipped place on line two and three  plus  lsu jumped up to line four after picking up a marquee  though controversial win at kentucky  while big   leading kansa state replace iowa

at this point  they can max out at   loss  which should be  good enough given what s below  <BRK> with   at large team and eight typical multi bid champion  there are   bid in play this seaon  while i ve already run down   team  just   count toward this total  a gonzaga and nevada are in a the representative of likely single bid conference  while purdue  louisville and iowa state aren t quite lock yet  all three are close enough for the purpose of this exercise  that mean there are   spot up for grab with a month to go  from line no   on down though  lock are few and far between  <BRK> no   s

<BRK> while buffalo  cincinnati  washington and wofford should be lock based on their loss total  the quality of their respective conference mean they re more prone to picking up defeat that could make their position le stable   <BRK> mississippi state  victorious over alabama in starkville  and ole miss  by sweeping their seaon series with auburn  were the week s biggest winner from this group

have a net ranking of  th  the  st ranked non conference schedule and win at tcu  none of those factor guarantee selection for caey alexander s club  but given the net s perceived influence on the selection committee  they have a shot   <BRK> ohio state slipped a bit after thursday s home loss to illinois  while respective midweek defeat to nc state and ole miss led to syracuse and auburn tumbling a bit  a for st  john s  the red storm s presence in the big eat s mediocre middle clas doen t help their cae  but their surprise sweep of marquette doe  then there s texa  whose quality win

georgetown   defeat that seriously damaged those squad own chance  alabama really need a quality road win for it case  but that ship might have already sailed considering their most difficult remaining away game come against arkansas to end the regular season  vcu s position ha grown more solid thanks to a five game win streak and the struggle of their bubble peer  nc state  meanwhile

try to avoid a rocky mountain sweep at utah on saturday night    p m  et  f    then there s our new entrant  ucf  which still lack a marquee win  but home victory over alabama and temple are a start  note that the knight still have four group   win chance  though three of those will be road contest    <BRK> a for belmont  the bruin  net of   is probably too high for at large consideration  given
