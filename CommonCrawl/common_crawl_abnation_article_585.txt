the new orleans saint should probably be preparing for a super bowl   matchup against the new england patriot  instead  it s the los angeles ram who won the nfc championship  largely due to blatant pas interference that wa somehow missed by official <BRK>with     left in a     game  drew brees threw a pas to tommylee lewis up the right sideline  but the receiver wa blasted out of bound by ram cornerback nickell robey coleman before the ball arrived <BRK>everyone   including the ram   knew it should ve been pas interference  the saint should ve been set up with a first down at about the   yard line  it would ve given them the chance to run out the majority of the remaining clock to set up a chip shot for wil lutz to win the game <BRK>but the saint had to kick their field goal early and the ram got the ball back with     left  they drove   yard and set up a game tying   yard field goal for greg zuerlein instead  he made that and a   yard field goal in overtime to send the ram to the super bowl <BRK>so  new orleans is pissed  and rightfully so  on monday  saint owner gayle benson released a statement saying she ll push for change to prevent a similar thing never happening again <BRK> no team should ever be denied the opportunity to reach the title game  or simply win a game  baed on the action  or inaction  of those charged with creating a fair and equitable playing field   part of benson s statement read   a is clear to all who watched the game  it is undeniable that our team and fan were unfairly deprived of that opportunity yesterday  i have been in touch with the nfl regarding yesterday s event and will aggressively pursue change in nfl policy to ensure no team and fan bae is ever put in a similar position again  <BRK>despite public silence from nfl commissioner roger goodell   something that ha irked saint tight end benjamin watson   he ha privately discussed the incident with benson <BRK>this week  sean payton ha spoken to roger goodell  svp of officiating al riveron  evp of football opetations troy vincent  comp committee chairman rich mckay  it wa explained to payton  it s a call that official should make  goodell also spoke to saint  owner gayle benson <BRK>it wasn t until   day after the game that goodell finally spoke publicly about the call <BRK>roger goodell  on the  saint missed call   we understand the frustration they feel  whenever the officiating is part of a discussion  it s not a good thing  but we also know our official are human      we will look again at instant replay  should replay be expanded  <BRK>but what will the nfl do now to correct the problem  maybe nothing <BRK>in the early hour of monday morning  saint receiver michael thomas asked his twitter follower to take a peek at a section buried near the bottom of the nfl rulebook <BRK>rule   section   article    nfl    <BRK>that article in the rulebook read a follows  emphais mine  <BRK>article    penalty for unfair act<BRK>the commissioner s power under this section   include the imposition of monetary fine and draft choice forfeiture  suspension of person involved in unfair act  and  if appropriate  the reversal of a game s result or the rescheduling of a game  either from the beginning or from the point at which the extraordinary act occurred  in the event of rescheduling a game  the commissioner will be guided by the procedure specified in          above  in all case  the commissioner will conduct a full investigation  including the opportunity for hearing  use of game video  and any other procedure the commissioner deems appropriate <BRK>saint fan have clung to that piece of desperation too with hundred of thousand signing a petition appealing nfl commissioner roger goodell to have the game replayed <BRK>it won t happen  while goodell can step in  send both team back to the superdome and have them replay the final couple minute of the game   he won t  that d be a decision so unprecedented that it d take much more than a missed call to qualify a an act  extraordinary  enough to have part of the game redone <BRK>it took over a week  but goodell finally confirmed that he never even considered it <BRK>goodell asked if he considered overturning result of ram saint game   absolutely not  <BRK>team get screwed all the time  just last year the jacksonville jaguar were probably robbed of a spot in the super bowl when linebacker myles jack wa incorrectly ruled down by contact after recovering a fumble in the afc championship against the patriot  <BRK>bu what the nfl may be able to do is make sure the situation that cost the saint doesn t happen again in the future <BRK>it didn t take long for the washington post to report monday that the nfl is already considering a possible rule change that would ve made the hit by robey coleman reviewable <BRK> it will be discussed at length along with additional foul that coach feel should be subject to review   one person familiar with the league s inner working said monday  speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the ongoing public furor over the botched call in new orleans <BRK>a high ranking official with one nfl team confirmed that making pas interference reviewable will be considered  adding   and there will be discussion on  replay  review of call and non call  <BRK>saint coach sean payton   who wa obviously irate about the missed call and immediately called the league office   is a member of the nfl competition committee  <BRK>payton ha been a proponent for making pas interference a reviewable play for some time now  here are some quote from payton after a game in october   when safety kenny vaccaro wa called for a controversial pas interference penalty against the panther  via espn <BRK> that specific call is so critical to get right   said payton  who said the idea ha been brought up and discussed by  a number of club  in recent year to no avail <BRK> and for good reason   payton said monday   i think the competition committee need to spend a lot more time thinking about  it   <BRK>patriot coach bill belichick agrees and ha proposed for year that all play be deemed reviewable  here he is in    via usa today <BRK> we had a situation this year where we added another exception to the replay rule because of a play that came up during the season  and it seems like that s kind of the way it go   something happens  and then  we have something else to challenge or make another play challengeable that wasn t in the past  and we re just going to keep adding to that  i d just like to clean it up and have a coach have two challenge  and if he get them right  he get a third  and that s it  he can use it on whatever play he want  <BRK>for now  pas interference fall under the  judgment call  definition  which make it non reviewable  play that have clear definition can be broken down with instant replay  for example  did a player get two foot down for a reception  did a player fumble before or after their knee wa down  did a player cross the goal line with the ball or come up just short <BRK>pas interference is a little more ambiguous and requires an official to decide if the violation  per the rulebook   significantly hinders an eligible player s opportunity to catch the ball   <BRK>but replay could certainly help that judgment  right  especially when it s a blatantly obvious a robey coleman s hit on lewis   a hit that earned robey coleman a   k fine <BRK>in the aftermath of that play  the league is willing to consider making these judgment call reviewable  per espn s adam schefter   though those review could come with a loss of yard or a clock runoff if the challenging team is overruled and the call on the field stand  robey coleman s hit will be a focal point of the rule committee s meeting this spring <BRK>it make sense  the point of instant replay is to get the call right on the field and this wa a clear case of where it could have fixed thing <BRK>if the nfl make pas interference a reviewable play  it d probably make sense to make all penalty reviewable  right  any kind of penalty can be crucial  tom brady got an iffy roughing the paser penalty that patrick mahomes didn t  should that have been reviewed too  maybe <BRK>if the league open those flood gate in the way belichick want  expect way more replay review <BRK>the rule allow each team to challenge twice per game and a third time if the first two challenge resulted in overturned play  but those challenge are still used sparingly <BRK>payton challenged seven play during the regular season and won three  no coach in the nfl challenge more than eight time  that mean even the most aggressive coach only challenged once every other game <BRK>but given the chance to look at penalty with replay  those challenge average could skyrocket  you think the nfl s three and a half hour game are long now  wait until there s double or triple the replay review <BRK>and even if all penalty aren t reviewable   just making pas interference reviewable would add to that game length  there were over     penalty called in   and   were pas interference  that s a lot of freshly reviewable play <BRK>new orleans wa definitely screwed by the non call  but it s not the only reason the saint lost  the ram had   yard of total offense  the saint had just     one of their worst offensive showing of the year <BRK>when they got the first down at the two minute warning deep in ram territory  the saint decided to pas on first and third down instead of run to waste clock and flush out los angeles  remaining timeouts  both pases were incomplete   even if the latter should ve been a penalty   and set up the ram with a great chance to tie <BRK> ram marcus peter on  saint anger over blown pas interference   if they coach run the football on first and second down  they probably ain t even going to be sitting here talking about this      you give sean mcvay the ball back with     or something  we re going to score  <BRK>and when the ram did tie  the game went to overtime and the saint got the ball first  but instead of scoring like the patriot did to win the afc championship  brees lobbed up an interception when he wa drilled by ram pas rusher dante fowler jr <BRK>the saint had a poor offensive showing and still had their chance to win  the official hurt them  but they also blew it on their own <BRK>maybe the nfl will take reactive measure to avoid the backlash they re currently facing for an egregious miss  but the fact of the matter remains that it really doesn t have to   it just need official to be better <BRK>
