the   offseason is underway  and club across the nfl have until march   to get their free agency plan in order  and  for some long tenured veteran  it could mean an uncomfortable phone call from their general manager <BRK>player across the league will be forced to free agency a franchise slah down their roster and create a much cap space a possible in an attempt to build a contender  lat year  former pro bowler like ndamukong suh  jonathan stewart  doug martin  and richard sherman were all waived in order to create space for most cost efficient talent    will be more of the same  just with different name <BRK>february saw player like connor barwin  matt bryant  and stewart all served their walking paper early  a handful of other well known player joined them shortly after and more will be coming  either moving on to the next chapter in their football career or closing the door on their nfl experience altogether <BRK>here are the big name who could be released before the   nfl draft <BRK>vinny curry  de  buccaneer<BRK>curry wa released on feb    after underwhelming in his first season with the defense le bucs  cutting him save tampa    million <BRK>demaryius thomas  wr  texan<BRK>footing the bill for thomas s      million   wa a stretch for houston even before the veteran wideout tore his achilles in late december  thomas averaged only     catch per game after being traded to the texan  marking his least productive season since    the four time pro bowler is   year old and coming off a major injury  which dampens his prospect for    there s still a place for a healthy thomas in the league   just not at an eight figure salary <BRK>the texan released him on feb    with a failed physical designation <BRK>charles clay  te  bill<BRK>clay fell way off his career average in    and his inability to adjust to a josh allen deep ball in miami cost buffalo a likely win against an afc east rival  <BRK>incredible   bill should be celebrating their third straight win  josh allen pull a miracle out and charles clay drop it   dolphin win  pic twitter com uexyelyut <BRK>he wa released feb     a move that save the bill      million  and now they ve got approximately    million to spend this offseason  expect a spree in western new york this spring <BRK>day later  clay landed with the arizona cardinal <BRK>dwayne allen  te  patriot<BRK>allen wa a red zone threat with the colt  but he wa little more than a blocker in new england  recording only   catch in his two season with the pat  rob gronkowski s uncertain future could give bill belichick pause  but his team can save      million outright by letting his te  hit the wire  new england isn t exactly swimming in cap space for    and allen  somehow  wa slated to be the team s seventh highest paid player for the upcoming season <BRK>a expected  the patriot decided to part way with him  it s still possible allen could return to new england  just on a lower salary <BRK>justin houston  olb  chief<BRK>houston is still a crushing pas rusher  but the chief aren t flush with cash and will have to figure out what to do with dee ford this offseason  cutting the four time pro bowler give kansa city an extra    million to spend   but it also take away a big time playmaker from the defense that proved to be it achilles  heel in    houston immediately becomes one of the most intriguing free agent on the market  though his   missed game the past three season could be a concern <BRK>desean jackson  wr  buccaneer  traded jackson proved he s still a legitimate deep threat in    but he s due    million for a rebuilding team with one of the lowest available cap total in the nfl this year  jettisoning the   year old would help jump start bruce arians  process in tampa  and it appears jackson isn t especially keen on staying  a clean break could be best for both side <BRK>the tension between the two side ramped up when jackson tweeted out a goodbye to florida march   <BRK>tampa it wa a great experience  but thing didn t work out    looking forward to my next destination        stay tuned   ne fone http   t co dnsvxc rmz<BRK>jackson hadn t officially been releaed a of his tweet  but after a statement like that it wa tough to see tampa holding on to him   especially following the drama of antonio brown s egress from pittsburgh  the bucs reportedly came to term on a trade that would return him to philadelphia not long after <BRK>malik jackson  dt  jaguar<BRK>jackson backslid mightily in    failing to justify his      million salary in the process  the   year old s sack number decreaed by more than half  and his sudden decline wa endemic of the problem that plagued the   afc finalist through a     return to mediocrity  with marcell dareus staying  jackson is the member of that d line who will be releaed a the jag attempt to figure out what went wrong <BRK>jackson isn t the only jaguar on his way out  the team freed up about    million in cap space in one day <BRK>we have released dt malik jackson  s tashaun gipson  rt jermey parnell  l carson tinker and rb carlos hyde <BRK>blake bortles  qb  jaguar<BRK>bortles  playoff performance a year prior earned him a three year     million stay of execution in jacksonville  his   saw him go     a a starter while throwing only   touchdown pases and earn a benching in favor of cody kessler     in the process  the jag tried to rectify that this offseaon by     handing nick foles    million and releaing bortles <BRK>robert quinn  de   dolphinsquinn underwhelmed in his first season in florida  and new head coach brian flores may want to move in a different direction from the eight year veteran  it s been four year since he s recorded double digit sack in a single season  that didn t stop the cowboy from taking a flier on him  however  quinn wan t released  but he wa traded to dallas four week before the   nfl draft <BRK>source  the  cowboy and dolphin have parameter in place on a trade to send pas rusher robert quinn to dallas  there are still minor issue to work out with quinn s agent  but the  cowboy are expected to land a big piece on the edge of their defense <BRK><BRK>ryan tannehill  qb  dolphin<BRK>the dolphin haven t been shy about their intention to move on from tannehill after six year  it won t be cheap  however  cutting the   year old quarterback would excise a little le than half of his      million from miami s   salary cap  while that eight figure space eating dead money is tough to swallow  that s still    million that can be spent on player who actually factor into the team s plan moving forward  brock osweiler wa roughly a good a tannehill lat fall  which somehow seems like an insult to both player <BRK>dre kirkpatrick  cb  bengal<BRK>kirkpatrick took up      million in cap space to star on one of the league s worst passing defense <BRK>he ll count a shade under    million in    marvin lewis is gone  and cincinnati s rebuild under zac taylor will likely mean kirkpatrick follows him  the bengal have to take some big move to wash the taste of a rotten   finish from their mouth  and jettisoning their fourth highest paid player could be the next one <BRK>joe haden  cb  steelers<BRK>haden s second season in pittsburgh wa better than his first  he remained a solid starting cornerback whose fourth quarter interception of tom brady helped keep the steelers  postseason hope alive until week   <BRK>joe haden  via  nfl pic twitter com ribuk joaf<BRK>but he s also due to make nearly    million in     a top   cap hit for a top   player at his position  excising him would save    million  which would go a long way for a team without much wiggle room this offseason  the steelers only have a projected      million to spend before bumping up against the cap <BRK>there s a chance haden and pittsburgh could reach common ground on a restructuring  given the steelers  late season dysfunction and the fact he ll be   year old in april  a trip to free agency with a shot at one last decent sized contract might be best for the afc north lifer <BRK>jordan reed  te  washington<BRK>releasing reed would leave a dead cap hit of      million  which is no small saving for a team without much wiggle room this spring  reed is a former pro bowler  but injury have limited him to just   game the past three season and he didn t look like himself in    he had just two touchdown catch while recording a career low     percent catch rate  however  with washington s quarterback situation up in the air the club may value having a veteran safety valve and some continuity more than the    million in saving he d create <BRK>jordan reed is a cheat code alex smith find reed on the outside slant and reed break the plane for the touchdown also  both peterson and reed did the  deangelohall  celebration when they scored  the respect is real  redskin pic twitter com jsujtnldgj<BRK>vernon davis is    had le of an impact than reed  and can create    million in saving with his release  washington ha it choice of tight end to get rid of if it need to create space <BRK>lesean mccoy  rb  bill<BRK>incredible   bill should be celebrating their third straight win  josh allen pull a miracle out and charles clay drop it   dolphin win  pic twitter com uexyelyut <BRK>mccoy s age   seaon saw his yard per carry number plummet to a career low      wa that due to the injury he battled all seaon  the fact buffalo s pasing offense wa one of the league s leat threatening  or because he s had more than     carry in his career  a      million saving isn t a priority  but it would also allow buffalo to walk away from the off field issue that have marred his legacy a a player <BRK>nelson agholor  wr  eagle<BRK>agholor shed the  bust  label that followed him over his first two year a a pro to develop into a useful  if not prolific target for the eagle  his      million fifth year option for   is entirely non guaranteed  and if philly think if can run with alshon jeffery at the top of it wr depth chart and a handful of cheaper option like a re signed jordan matthew and mack hollins  it could send the usc product to the unemployment line <BRK>allen robinson  wr  bear<BRK>robinson wa the centerpiece of an offensive overhaul in    and his work on the field helped mitchell trubisky develop from overwhelmed rookie into a decent starter  however  the bear have le than    million in spending space this offseason   sixth lowest in the league  cutting robinson  who wa good but not great in his first season at soldier field  would add    million to that total  <BRK>andrus peat  g  saint<BRK>peat wa part of an offensive line that ranked fourth in the league in sack allowed in    and he wa rewarded with a pro bowl bid for his service  but he rated out poorly in individual play  making him and his      million salary potentially expendable in new orleans  the saint have le than    million to spend this offseason  and releasing or restructuring peat would be one way to fund a shopping spree  restructuring drew brees contract and finding a way to cut down his      million cap hit is probably a more likely road to saving <BRK>derek carr  qb  raider<BRK>oakland ha been shedding talent and salary in order to rebuild in jon gruden s image  cutting carr   just two year removed from being an honest to god mvp candidate   would be a curious move  but so wa trading a former defensive player of the year in his prime  carr is due      million next fall and would only leave      million of that on the team s cap sheet if released  it s probably not going to happen   gruden ha more than    million in space to work with this offseason already   but trying to predict anything the raider do at this point seems fruitless <BRK>releasing aj mccarron would save    million and would likely be the smarter move     but the smartest move would have been not to trade for the player who got beat out by nathan peterman for a spot on the depth chart in the first place <BRK>joe flacco  qb  raven<BRK>baltimore belongs to lamar jackson now  and keeping flacco a a      million backup would have been terribly expensive luxury  releaing or trading him  however  would still leave    million of dead money  holding on to both jackson and flacco would cost approximately      million   a smaller cap hit than drew brees  kirk cousin  or matthew stafford will cost their team next seaon  <BRK>in the end  the raven decided to trade the super bowl xlvii mvp  sending him off the to bronco  though it won t become official until the start of the new league year in march  <BRK>cornerback jimmy smith  who ha missed at leat four game in each of the three seaon  could be a caualty a well  the   year old defensive back ha his team s second highest cap hit  and releaing him would save more than    million <BRK>eli manning  qb  giant<BRK>this would be a far more likely scenario if new york had any semblance of a franchise quarterback waiting in it wing  however  swing on rhett bomar  ryan nasib  and davis webb all failed to work out    draftee kyle lauletta wa uninspiring in his first action a a pro  and while the club could snap up the   draft s first quarterback with the no    overall pick  it may behoove coach pat shurmur to keep manning around to serve a a      million mentor  <BRK>the giant would save    million by releasing their longtime quarterback  a number that would almost double their available cap space for the upcoming season  those saving drop to    million if he s cut or traded after march    so thing get a bit more expensive if they wait to see how the draft shake out  <BRK>  certainly wasn t the fresh start shurmur had hoped for   but the giant head coach remains committed to manning  at the nfl combine  he told reporter that the   year old quarterback will be back in   <BRK>gerald mccoy  dt  buccaneer<BRK>mccoy remains a strong interior defender  but at    million he s be league s sixth highest paid tackle  his all pro day are behind him a he glide into his  s  but he s still a suffocating presence in the middle of the field who is capable of collapsing pocket from the inside out  if tampa think he can thrive with some upgraded support from the edge  he could be worth that eight figure payday  if not  the bucs can cut him without owing him a dime <BRK>tampa bay ha examined it option and then came to the conclusion    million is a reasonable cost for mccoy s contribution up front  he ll remain with the team in   <BRK>vic beasley  de  falcon<BRK>beasley wa a breakout star in    racking up     sack and earning first team all pro honor  in the two year since  he s only got    that make his      million cap hit potentially untenable for a falcon team in need of some improvement  <BRK>however  dan quinn said that beasley will return to atlanta  perhaps without restructuring his deal <BRK>marcell dareus  dt  jaguar<BRK>the jaguar entered the offseason likely to release dareus and or malik jackson  at the end of february  dareus restructured his contract  bringing his base salary down to      million and clearing more than    million in cap space for the jag  he ll remain with the team in    <BRK>emmanuel sander  wr  bronco<BRK>sander had what would have been a     yard seaon had he played all   game and appeared to have a good rapport with cae keenum  but now the bronco traded for joe flacco  and they have more than    million to spend a they rebuild under new head coach vic fangio  releaing the soon to be   year old and turning the rein of the receiving game over to courtland sutton would free up more than    million in cah  <BRK>but john elway ruled it out  telling reporter at the combine that the team wa exercising sander  option  that made the receiver happy <BRK>my contract read one last ride    coach said it s happening   let s make it a great one  broncoscountry  pic twitter com wcvqysudvm<BRK>case keenum  qb  bronco<BRK>keenum landed a two year     million contract with john elway after his breakthrough   season  now it appears he won t see his entire short term deal through  the bronco struck up a trade to acquire joe flacco from the raven  making the former super bowl mvp denver s bridge quarterback into the future  <BRK>rather than cut him  john elway found a way to offload keenum and his contract  working out a deal to send the quarterback to washington <BRK>devante parker  wr  dolphin<BRK>parker ha never had a many a   receiving yard in a seaon and ha averaged only three reception per game a a dolphin  maybe flores can unlock the potential that made him the  th overall pick in    because the dolphin gave parker a new two year deal <BRK>
