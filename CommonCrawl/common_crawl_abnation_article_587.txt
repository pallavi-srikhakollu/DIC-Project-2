i ll be honest with you  having seen all the playoff game live lat weekend  i wa initially pretty sure that i wa going to pick chief outside linebacker justin houston a my ho this week  but then when i turned on the film  it wa his teammate and fellow outside linebacker  dee ford  who actually kept catching my eye  houston did have a pretty good game in his own right  but by the time i wa finished breaking the film down it wa clear to me that ford wa actually the more impactful of the two  <BRK> ford  who wa selected  rd overall in the   draft  ha had an up and down career thus far  however  with free agency on the horizon this offseason  he had the best season of his career this year with   sack and a ton of pressure  his get off and speed rush are weapon that opposing offense have to account for every week  he will no doubt get paid an exorbitant amount of money from either the chief or another team to rush the passer this spring  and that price tag will surely continue to go up if he keep playing out of his mind like he did on saturday  <BRK> i like ford a lot a a pas rusher  but he usually leaf something to be desired for me when it come to finishing off play  on saturday  however  he wa hustling his as off and making play all over the damn field  he literally started the game off with a big play  a tackle for a   yard loss on indianapolis running back marlon mack  he didn t take his foot off the ga until the chief pulled him off the field right at the end of the end of regulation when the game wa already decided in kansa city s favor   <BRK> his performance wa a huge part of why the chief were able to bottle up a pretty high powered colt offense for much of the game  <BRK> let s take a look at some of those impact play he made this past weekend  shall we  <BRK> with just under five minute left in the first quarter  the colt found themselves already down     and facing a third and   from their own   yard line  after going three and out on their first two drive  they desperately needed to get something  anything  going on offense to keep the game from getting out of hand  <BRK> ford wa lined up in his usual spot a the left edge rusher  and he had a really nice get off on the snap  a usual  a i mentioned before  everybody who watch film know how fat ford can get around the edge  so naturally colt right tackle braden smith set a little soft so he could try to keep up with ford s speed rush  <BRK> only this time ford eschewed his normal dip and rip around the edge for a bull rush right down the middle of smith  to say that smith wa caught off guard by ford s power rush would be the epitome of understatement  to his credit  smith did a decent job of recovering after ford had momentarily lifted him up off the ground and pushed him back about six yard into luck s lap  <BRK> smith wa at least able to stay in front of and engaged with ford  but the problem wa he lost so much ground initially  that his body precluded luck from being able to step up in the pocket  with his path forward blocked  ford wa then in position to come off smith s block and take him down  along with houston coming around the edge against the left tackle  luck quickly realized he would have to try to escape outside of the pocket to have any chance of salvaging the play  <BRK> ford did end up coming off of smith s block when he saw luck scrambling  but he wan t quite able to take down luck  what ford did do  however  wa give a great effort by diving at luck s leg to force him even deeper into the backfield   <BRK> the result wa that although luck did technically break containment around ford  he wa so far behind the line of scrimmage at that point that houston wa still able to come away with a sack on him after he ran him down all the way to the far sideline and knocked him out of bound  <BRK> houston get credit for the sack there  but ford s big time bull rush and hustle were obviously a huge factor on that play  the end result wa the colt three and out once again  and the chief offense went down the field on the ensuing drive and kicked a field goal to bury them even further  <BRK> oh  but ford wa just warming up  <BRK> late in the third quarter  indianapolis showed some sign of life  down      the colt defense forced a sammy watkins fumble on a fly sweep on the very first play of a kansa city drive  they recovered it at the chief    yard line  if the colt offense could have just punched it in there  the deficit would have been cut to   point and thing could ve gotten mighty interesting in the fourth quarter  <BRK> ala  ford wa having none of that on saturday  <BRK> after an incompletion on the first play of the drive  indianapolis tried to throw it again on the next play  it did not go so well  <BRK> ford wa again the left edge rusher  and this time he did indeed utilize his patented speed rush  smith wa not ready  the colt were in empty set  so smith didn t have the benefit of a potential chip block to slow ford down  with the chief sending five rusher  he also couldn t count on any help from the right guard if ford made an inside move  it appeared to me that smith initially tried to set a little firmer in case ford went with a power rush again  but the problem is that ford is so fast when he commits to a speed rush  if you don t set for it  he can literally run right past you  <BRK> a smith quickly learned  <BRK> to make matter worse  because smith hadn t set for speed initially  he ended up having to turn his body perpendicular to the line of scrimmage to try to catch up to ford around the corner  turning his body that way did allow smith to intercept ford just a ford wa turning the corner  but it also gave ford a softer  shorter corner to get around  smith didn t stand a chance at that point  <BRK> and luck wa barbecued chicken  <BRK> ford didn t really even have to do any kind of hand move  he chopped with his inside hand a if he wa going to try to dent smith s punch attempt  but smith couldn t even get his hand close enough to him for ford to chop them  ford ended up just sinking in a nice dip and rip move on smith s outside shoulder and continuing on his merry way  <BRK> luck had just taken a crow hop forward and wa about to begin his throwing motion when ford reached with his outside hand and basically snatched the ball right out of luck s grasp  smith pulled ford away after he caused that fumble  so that ford couldn t recover the fumble  but there wan t anybody to keep houston from jumping on it  and he recovered the football at the chief    yard line  <BRK> just like that  one of the colt  best scoring opportunity of the day wa squandered thanks to ford  the chief got decent starting field position out of it to boot  without that turnover  who know how the rest of the game might have played out  <BRK> ok  let s talk about one more of ford s impressive play  <BRK> a little later in the game  in the fourth quarter  ford almost got himself another sack and caused fumble  smith wa once again his victim  <BRK> this time it wa the first play of another colt drive where they were backed up at their own   yard line and still down     with only     left in the game  indy did have a running back offset to ford s side in shotgun and in position to chip this time  but the running back didn t even to help out on him  leaving smith all alone on an island again  that continued to be the opposite of a winning strategy for indianapolis  <BRK> after burning smith with that speed rush earlier  ford decided to go back with another bull rush this time around  after getting beat with both speed and power all game  i guess smith thought he would try to split the difference and instead of setting for one or the other  he just kept backpedaling to try to stay in front of ford and hoped for the best  <BRK> when he saw smith drifting backwards  ford put his helmet right under smith s chin and got so much push that smith s foot ended up being in the luck s way  luck tried to step into a throw and smith s inside foot tripped him at the same time ford wa reaching inside with his inside hand to try to force another fumble  <BRK> luck ended up falling forward from smith tripping him  and ford wa able to hit luck s arm right above the elbow just a luck s hand came forward  the ball did slip out of luck s hand  but his arm wa already into his throwing motion and it wa correctly ruled an incompletion on the field  had ford hit his arm just a half a second sooner  he would have had another sack and caused fumble on the day  <BRK> dee ford played a complete a game a i have ever seen him play a a pro on saturday  and he had the chief defense looking pretty damn dominant against the colt  of all the play he made  though  i think  hand down  the sack and caused fumble right after the chief had turned over the ball deep in their own territory  really helped to seal the victory for the home team  that play in and of itself might have earned ford ho honor this week  but the fact that he added two other pressure  a tackle for a loss  a hit on the quarterback  and three other tackle  made his selection somewhat of a no brainer   <BRK> for his effort against the colt to get the chief to the afc championship  ford is my ho of the week for the divisional round of the playoff  <BRK> if he can play at that level or close this weekend  tom brady is going to have a long day  <BRK>
