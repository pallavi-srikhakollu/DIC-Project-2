le veon bell doesn t want to be a steeler unless he can glean a market resetting long term contract  pittsburgh ha made it clear it won t meet his demand  and saddling him with the franchise tag for a third straight season wouldn t just be prohibitively expensive   it would also likely trigger another lengthy holdout  <BRK> bell failed to report to the team s practice facility by nov     which mean per the league s collective bargaining agreement  he wa obligated to sit the whole season out  with the   season now over  he ll be able to hit reset on his career after a year long game of chicken where neither side blinked  <BRK> the league s transition tag could ve helped the steelers recoup some asset in an offseason trade  and even help bell secure a front loaded big money deal in the process  <BRK> according to espn s adam schefter  the steelers were thinking about doing just that  they won t  though  <BRK> steelers gm kevin colbert say they will not put tag on le veon bell  thus he will become a ufa <BRK> the transition tag is a le expensive version of the franchise tag that allows a player to garner contract offer from other interested team  it offer a team the right of first refusal when it come to one of it unrestricted free agent  that give the free agent to be more leverage than he d have under the franchise designation   but it benefit his current team a well  the tagging franchise ha the opportunity to match the term of the contract it player would otherwise sign elsewhere  <BRK> like the franchise tag  it also come with a designated one year contract  in this case  it s the average salary of the top   highest paid player at the tagged player s position  or   percent of what the player earned the previous year  so  based on what bell earned in    the transition tag mean he would be in line for the same      million that his franchise tag wa supposed to be worth  that is  if he were to sign his transition tender  he wouldn t    <BRK> team can use the transition tag once per season  team cannot use the transition tag and the franchise tag in the same year  and  unlike the franchise tag  if a player sign elsewhere  the club get no compensation for it loss  <BRK> the transition tag effectively turn an unrestricted free agent into a restricted one  though without the added team security of receiving draft pick should the player leave  by tagging bell  pittsburgh could sit back and wait for other team to make offer on the all pro tailback  once he get an offer to his liking  he ll start the clock on the steelers  seven day window to either match the contract or let him walk  that would give pittsburgh the opportunity to re sign bell at a lower figure should his market never materialize  or use it transition tag given right to sign him to an astronomical deal  then trade him to whichever interested party is offering the biggest return for bell and his new contract  <BRK> it could ve been a reasonable gambit for the club  but not a great one  james conner ha been a star in his own right filling in for bell this past season season  plus  team rarely use the transition tag because it s easy to game   <BRK> a team with oodles of cap space in     say  the colt or jet or texan or really any of the   franchise carrying le salary into next year than pittsburgh   could offer bell a front loaded contract  the steelers would ve had to match any deal to it exact term  putting an incredible strain on their cap space   <BRK> a deal with big money over the first year or two would make sense  too  bell isn t getting any younger  so paying out the nose early in a contract to lessen the cost of a running back s age    season is a smart move  and bell would happily sign any deal that get him the guaranteed money for which he s been searching  but especially so if he know it put pittsburgh in a position where it can t match  <BRK> on the other hand  the team doesn t have many feasible option to recoup more than a supplemental draft pick in exchange for losing a homegrown talent  the steelers could franchise tag bell again  but that would be a major drain on the club s offseason cap space in the lead up to any deal  since bell would be entering his third year under the designation  he would cost the team the average salary of the league s five highest paid quarterback   approximately      million  depending on how the rest of the year shake out  <BRK> so the transition tag wa on the table  but ultimately it probably wouldn t have had much of an effect aside from earning bell a contract that pay big over his first year or two with a new team  it would have at least given pittsburgh the opportunity to retain bell and extend the club s window to work out a trade with a needy franchise  thankfully for all party  the steelers are finally ready to just move on  <BRK>
