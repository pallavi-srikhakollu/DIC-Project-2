antonio brown want out of pittsburgh  and it look like the steelers are ready to oblige by trading the star receiver  <BRK>  <BRK> that s easier said than done with brown under contract through the   season  the steelers won t save much money by parting with the receiver  and it probably make sense for the team to smooth thing over with the seven time pro bowler  but that reconciliation is looking increasingly unlikely  <BRK> brown turn   in july  and ha posted at least     receiving yard in six consecutive season   an accomplishment only he  jerry rice  torry holt  and randy moss can claim  brown also led the nfl in receiving touchdown during the   season with    <BRK> but the drama between the receiver and the steelers boiled over to the point that brown sat out the team s week   finale to the   season  <BRK> the saga may end with brown playing elsewhere  that d be a huge shakeup  and the  er  cowboy  and packer are all considered possible landing spot  we ll keep track of all the rumor right here  <BRK> after a quiet friday night and saturday  brown lit thing back up with a middle of the night tweet that showed him in a raider uniform  <BRK>         raidernation pic twitter

brown  <BRK> a statement from gm brandon beane  pic twitter com gk wmqftca <BRK> brown may have nixed the deal  <BRK> steelers and bill had positive  trade talk last night  but deal fell apart because antonio brown nixed going to buffalo  per source  <BRK> or maybe not   <BRK> a league source reiterated to me this am that the  bill and  steelers were not close to making a trade  and saying it fell apart broke down is based on incorrect info  <BRK> it s possible a trade doesn t happen before the weekend  <BRK> a talk continue on a potential antonio brown trade  and the situation continues to be fluid   nothing is close  at this time  per a source  the brown saga go on  the steelers ha told team that they expected  and wanted  this in place by friday  that now look challenging  <BRK> welp  this is a roller coaster   <BRK> first it looked like brown wa headed to the bill  <BRK> source  the  steelers are closing in on a deal to send star wr antonio brown to the buffalo  bill  there it is  <BRK> but nope  that s probably not happening  <BRK> an nfl source say  bill have inquired about antonio brown with the  steelers  but no deal is imminent  in fact  another league source termed it  unlikely   <BRK> three more team are no longer in the running for brown  according to espn s dianna russini  the saint  titan  and washington   <BRK> ian rapoport and adam schefter are both reporting

likelier after the football world converged on indianapolis for the nfl combine  according to ian rapoport  three team have emerged a favorite for brown  <BRK> one takeaway from combine week in indy  the  steelers have enough interest in wr antonio brown to be able to trade him before march    source say  the  raider   bronco  and  azcardinals are among the team who have appeared the most intrigued  <BRK> a pair of bronco reporter   including nicki jhabvala of the athletic   say that denver isn t actually interested  though  <BRK> reiterating what  mikeklis just said  i m told the bronco are not involved in any discussion to try to acquire antonio brown from the steelers  <BRK> the raider have been a consistently mentioned landing spot for a while  but the addition of the

antonio brown to date are the oakland raider  washington redskin and tennessee titan  per league source  thus  the battle for brown could develop into a battle between grudens  jon and jay  <BRK>

message he conveyed to brown  <BRK>  we re open to shopping around the league to see what may be available in exchange for your service  by no mean are we going to make a trade or any type of move that will not be beneficial to the pittsburgh steelers organization  specifically  we will not be discounting you on the trade market  and we certainly will not be releasing you   <BRK> all that being said  we ll take a positive approach  if someone ha a sincere interest and they want to make a move   either a significant draft pick  or a set of pick  or a significant player plus pick   and we think it will benefit the pittsburgh steelers in the long run  then we re all in  if not  then we ll make that decision at that point   <BRK> brown met with steelers owner art rooney ii and posted that the two came to an agreement that it wa  time to move on   <BRK> had a great meeting with mr rooney today we discussed a lot of thing and we cleared the air on several issue  we both agreed  that

    if your team got guaranteed money  they want to get to know me and work with me  tell them to call me   <BRK> brown posted several tweet to clarify his desire for a trade  even calling out quarterback ben roethlisberger and coach mike tomlin  <BRK> no conflict just a matter of respect  mutual respect  he ha a owner mentality like he can call out anybody including coach  player know but they can t say anything about it otherwise they meal ticket gone  it s a dirty game within a game   truth http   t co mssybvd ny <BRK> after the coach tell the team i quit while nursing some bump then

way for brown to get himself traded  but it also scared off at least one team  according to nbc s peter king  <BRK> i think the more antonio brown tweet  the more he scare off potential suitor   that
