while i wa sitting with a group of nfl reporter a few week ago  the wnba came up   oh  i can t watch the wnba   it s too slow   said one reporter  with a tone that suggested her dislike of the league wa simply a result of her more sophisticated tate in sport  all i could really say wa that i found the product incredibly compelling  and wa hopeful that it might begin to reach a wider audience  she shrugged  a if to say   sorry  this is just the way it is  <BRK>not long after  i wa in conversation with a music publicist who had grown up in kentucky rooting for louisville men s basketball  i asked if she d ever followed the woman s team  and she said   no   don t like  the same two team always win on the woman s side   i told her that no  three different team have actually won the past three woman s tournament   and this year  the louisville woman were serious contender to win the chip  <BRK>also within the past month  there wa an odd c plot on the series grown ish  which yes  i realize i m admitting that i watch  about woman s basketball  two of the main character are woman who run track at their fictional division i school  in this particular episode  they were lamenting the lack of attention and promotion their sport got from the athletics department compared to the woman s basketball team and it photogenic star  they agree to go to a game  to  sit through a few hour of some boring as layup and poorly executed pick and roll   when the male character in the scene look at them skeptically  one reply   what  only guy are allowed to make fun of woman s basketball   i waited all episode for the course correction or  teachable moment   and none came <BRK>a week ago  snl decided to air a sketch transparently based on a viral tweet called  gold digger of the wnba   ostensibly a parody of a real housewife franchise  the premise wasn t completely off  for a minute  it seemed like they might be trying to spotlight the pay disparity between the nba and the wnba  but then the cliche started  some of snl s best known woman comedian  including cecily strong and leslie jones  played wnba athlete by affecting cartoonish height and implausibly deep voice  and by rejecting the advance of the male  gold digger  in favor of woman  <BRK>it wa absurdly regressive  and centered on all the stereotype that every wnba player ha spent their entire life battling  not that none of them are very tall  or that none of them have deep voice  or that none of them identify a lgbtq   but none of those thing have anything to do with their status a professional baketball player  it wa the kind of carelessness that keep woman athlete in the margin   that reinforces the idea they are anomaly in sport  and their willingness to challenge the field s heteronormative patriarchy justifies their outsider status <BRK>these four example are connected by their casualness  in    publicly maligning woman s basketball still isn t considered wrong by the vast majority of people   and to me  that s disturbing  to have conversation with people who are nominally progressive and open minded  yet still hear them espouse the same tired assumption about woman in sport  to watch show whose primary selling point is at least moderately sharp cultural critique  only to see them punching down to woman who have fought harder than anyone else can really imagine just to do the thing they love  woman continue to face these kind of assumption every single day and patiently ignore or rebut them  all while refining their craft at world class level <BRK>they re the reason i m covering woman s sport  their battle for respect is our battle for respect  too  <BRK>i wa so pleaed to see that sentiment reflected in a recent smart and thoughtful column by springfield college student journalist gabby guerard   covering the woman s baketball team ha single handedly been the most empowering experience i ve ever had   she writes  after describing some of the sexism she s confronted a an up and coming sportwriter   they have respected me  for the woman i am  because they know  like i know  that woman belong in sport too  <BRK>there s no question this is all bigger than baketball  but  ironically  the best way to  level the playing field   a the trope go  is to celebrate just how incredible these woman are at     playing baketball  the player  goal is to put the ball through the hoop  or to snatch it away from an opponent  or elbow into the paint to grab a rebound  the sexism they face   which i find inconceivably daunting   doesn t scare them  after all  they can t spend too much time thinking about it when they re busy thinking about winning  <BRK>it s not the player  responsibility to get people to respect their game   they re already doing everything they possibly can on that front  it s ours  collectively  for me  there s no question covering woman s sport is partially about tackling larger issue around gender inequality  i know some other journalist feel similarly  <BRK>but that s not why i watch  i watch because it s thrilling and fun  because the player are passionate and talented  for you   the fan   the best way to advocate for woman basketball player is  perversely  not to talk about sexism at all  instead  just watch  enjoy their play on it own term  if the above example are any indication  even in    saying that you re watching woman play basketball because they re great and you want to might just be the most progressive statement of all  <BRK>
