head coach  mike bloomgren       second year  <BRK>   record and s p  ranking        th  <BRK> projected   record and s p  ranking        th  <BRK> five key point  <BRK> bill c s annual preview series of every fbs team in college football continues  catch up here  <BRK> the draw of a stanford system for c usa s smart kid school is obvious   <BRK> most team spread you out in this conference  too  and in a best cae scenario  bloomgren attracts the right mix of talent  brawn  and competitiveness to punish rival defense for getting smaller and fater  but a it did for jim harbaugh at the farm more than a decade ago  it ll probably take a little while  <BRK>     rice football preview <BRK> though result have leveled off a bit   in    the cardinal finished outside of the s p  top   for the first time since    granted  they were  th    stanford remains one of the most unlikely sustained success in college football  the cardinal don t have an immense athletic budget  a voluminous fan base  or a blueblood s history  and they do have restrictive admission standard  yet they ve averaged   win per year for the last decade  <BRK> rice s stature within conference usa ha some parallel with where stanford wa in about    when jim harbaugh took the job  the school s history is dotted with random success  but sustainability ha been a problem  david bailiff sustained it better than most  taking the owl to four bowl in a seven year span and winning the   c usa title  <BRK> rice went     with s p  ranking in the  s in each of his last two season  and when stanford guy mike bloomgren took over last year  he wa going to need a yearlong reset  a year zero  before he could build  still  i thought he had an outside shot at three or four win  <BRK> rice wa lucky to win two  <BRK> the depth chart got stripped down even further than i anticipated  bloomgren encouraged quarterback jackson tyner to focus on baseball  backup miklo small transferred  two more qbs got hurt in season  which led to two different redshirting freshman seeing action  leading returning rusher nahshon ellerbe missed most of the year with injury  left tackle calvin anderson  probably the best player on the   team  transferred to texas  <BRK> the two deep wa a husk of talent and experience  and the owl produced a post game win expectancy higher than   percent in just one game  a rousing season finale win over odu   it took some fluky bounce for them to beat even prairie view a m  utep and utsa won a combined four game in    two came against rice  and by a combined   point  <BRK> it wa bad  and now we begin to find out if there wa a point to the pain  <BRK> most of last season s better player return in    and bloomgren ha added a layer of transfer to the offense  stanford center brian chaffin  harvard quarterback tom stewart  nc central left tackle nick leverett  a three year starter   the defensive line  one of the relative strength  ha to get rebuilt  but basically every other unit brings more experience now  <BRK> rice ha a chance to improve a bit  but you won t know it from the owl  record  a the schedule is unforgiving  they are  per s p   at leat a three touchdown underdog in every non conference game  and not only do they play only four team with a projected ranking in the  s  but they play all four on the road  their average projected win total is      and if they exceed s p  expectation by a touchdown per game  it rise to only      <BRK> still  you can show improvement even while losing  and we ll see if a year of focus on physicality and competition can yield a better product  <BRK>

   <BRK> few coach made more liberal use of the new four game redshirt rule than bloomgren  redshirting rice freshman ended up throwing for   yard    from wiley green   rushing for   non sack yard  all from green   catching   pass  brendan harmon   and starting four game on the offensive line  clay servin  jake syptak   he gave guy like green and servin the most extended playing time possible  we ll see how quickly that pay off  <BRK> green s performance wa particularly enticing  he wa absolutely overwhelmed in his first game against fiu    for   for eight yard with two interception  but produced a respectable     passer rating thereafter  <BRK> thanks to the addition of stewart  who produced a     rating at harvard last year and doesn t mind throwing vertically   rice will head into spring ball with four quarterback who have seen sustained playing time  stewart  green  sophomore evan marshman  whose injury opened the door for green once original starter shawn stankavage went down   and sam glaesmann  a part time starter in    <BRK> throw in another redshirt freshman  parker town  who went   for   against louisiana tech and lsu  and incoming freshman jovoni johnson  and you ve got a crowded qbs room  we ll see if anyone emerges  <BRK> rice s tendency were very stanford like in     run on standard down  run on passing down  play at the slowest tempo imaginable   th in adjusted pace   try to avoid negative play  but the receiving corp wa probably the best thing the owl  offense had  and that could be the case again  <BRK> whichever quarterback emerges from the pile will have junior austin trammell and aaron cephus  combined    catch      yard    tds  at their disposal  plus an up the seam threat in tight end jordan myers      yard per catch  and lanky incoming junior bradley rozner      yard per catch in two season at cisco cc   harmon got his foot wet  and converted db d angelo elli caught three ball for   yard against lsu late last year  <BRK> somehow rice ha one of the more tantalizing receiving corp in the conference  and aside from elli  it is devoid of senior  we ll see if the qbs and the system take advantage  <BRK> well  let me rephrase  unless some new starter thrive  rice will be throwing a lot anyway  simply because of the large number of second  and third and longs  <BRK> the owl have to replace last year s top two rusher  austin walter and emmanuel esukpa  and both starter on the right side of the line  sam pierce and joseph dill   but the aforementioned new starter are intriguing  leverett wa all meac  chaffin wa a high three star prospect  and while rice had averaged     point in it first three conference game  the owl averaged   in servin s three start  in all    of   line start went to six freshman and sophomore  and all are scheduled to return  i think the line improves a good amount  <BRK> plus  walter s and esukpa s absence could mean more playing time for sophomore juma otoviano  easily the most intriguing of last year s back  albeit in a small sample   he played in seven game  rushed   time for just   yard in the first six  and then exploded for   yard and two score in the win over odu  you don t want to overreact to one big game  but that wa one big game  <BRK> coordinator jerry mack  formerly a highly successful head coach at nc central  will have an interesting balance to strive for this fall  the incoming grad transfer  plus veteran back like nahshon ellerbe and aston walter  could help to give the owl a higher floor  but it will probably be tempting to look at the   schedule and start work on the   offense instead  combining green  otoviano  servin  and the young linemen with that high ceiling receiving corp could make for big thing a year from now  <BRK> a daily ish mini column on the college football thing of the day  with some other stuff too  <BRK> defense ha dragged rice down for year  the last time the owl  d ranked higher in s p  than their offense wa    their conference title year  they were  st in def  s p  that year and proceeded to slip to  th   th   th  and  th under bailiff   <BRK> they rebounded in    though  to  th  <BRK> unfortunately  most of the improvement wa baed around a line that doesn t really exist any more  rice ranked  th in stuff rate  run stop at or behind the line   which wa about a good a ranking a it produced in anything  and the run defense wa ahead of the pas defense overall   th in rushing marginal efficiency   th pasing   <BRK> tackle zach abercrumbia  roe wilkins  and parker hanusa  and rush end graysen schantz are gone  granted  coordinator brian smith deployed a pretty big rotation up front  which will help  tackle elijah garcia and myles adam were also contributor  and adam actually led the line in havoc play  five tackle for loss  two forced fumble   plus  sophomore rush end trey schuman had a higher ratio of havoc play to tackle    percent  than schantz      but to deploy a big a rotation in   will require playing quite a few true or redshirt freshman  <BRK> outside of the front four  a lot of young guy took a lot of lump in    the linebacking corp consisted of three sophomore and two freshman  and played like sophomore and freshman  but anthony ekpe wa a one man pas rush  leading the team with six sack  adam wa the only other player with more than one   and junior to be blaze alldredge made     tfls while finishing second on the team in tackle  <BRK> the secondary wa ultra young  too  but a couple of transfer will keep it on the young side  the top five tackler in the back were underclassman  but only three return  safety george nyakwol and prudy calderon and corner tyrae thornton  they had combined for five career tackle heading into   but produced     tackle  five tfls  six interception  and   breakup   yes  they produced these number while getting burned a decent amount  still   <BRK> losing corner justin bickham and safety houston robert to transfer  however  mean player like redshirt freshman andrew bird      tackle in two game   juco transfer naeem smith  and star recruit jake bailey will need to contribute sooner than later  <BRK> great special team have long been part of the stanford formula  the owl surged from  th to  th in special team s p   and junior austin trammell wa one of the reason why  <BRK> unfortunately  he s really the only returnee  jack fox wa a great kickoff guy  booming punter  and decent place kicker  so losing him is like losing three guy  still  special team is always going to be a major focus with bloomgren  so maybe fox s replacement will be strong  too  <BRK> rice will field a lineup that feature exciting underclassman in most unit  so while improvement might be light  most of the reason for that improvement will come back in    when the owl could boast   to   returning starter  depending on how young mack chooses to go on offense   the defense will likely start only one senior   <BRK> keep this in mind when rice is getting dragged early in    the owl begin with army  wake forest  texas  baylor  louisiana tech  and defending c usa champ uab  four of these game are in houston  that probably won t matter much  <BRK> in all  s p  project rice a a favorite in just one game  home against utep  and a a single digit underdog in just one more  at utsa   the non conference slate is unforgiving  and the home road split in conference are downright cruel  with most of the more beatable opponent playing host to the owl  <BRK> still  i d be surprised if rice isn t more competitive  and i m not just saying that because of the near total lack of   competitiveness  having a young base mean rice will be awfully volatile  but the good moment could give bloomgren s team a shot at a couple of upset  the goal is to stock on just enough moment to keep growth on pace for    <BRK> all   preview data to date  <BRK>
