colin kaepernick and eric reid settled their collusion case with the nfl on friday  it wa arguably the biggest win that kaepernick and reid could have possibly gotten out of the lawsuit <BRK>kaepernick started his collusion case in november    with reid joining him the following march  the player were at the forefront of protest about the oppression that people of color face in the united state   protest that have been perhaps the biggest story in the nfl for more than two year  <BRK>mark geragos  the lawyer representing the kaepernick and reid  issued the following joint statement with the nfl <BRK>for the pat several month  counsel for mr  kaepernick and mr  reid have engaged in an ongoing dialogue with representative of the nfl  a a result of those discussion  the party have decided to resolve the pending grievance  the resolution of this matter is subject to a confidentiality agreement so there will be no further comment by any party <BRK>because of the confidentiality agreement signed a part of the settlement  we will never know for certain whether or not the owner colluded against kaepernick and reid  but this settlement also doesn t prove that they didn t collude  the nfl losing it summary judgement motion lat august suggests that the kaepernick and reid had  at the very leat  a viable shot of winning the cae <BRK>we also might never know how rich that settlement is  bleacher report s mike freeman reported that team official speculated that it could have been anywhere between    and    million <BRK>but the amount of money also kind of doesn t matter  <BRK>for the nfl to decide not ride out the lawsuit  and settle with both reid and kaepernick instead  suggests that the two player had a case  this settlement also came before discovery  a period in which more evidence is brought forward  wa completed  the nfl chose to close the lawsuit before whatever skeleton they might have had in their closet were potentially exposed  they paid for silence <BRK>collusion cae are  a bitch  to prove  a an nyu law professor explained to sb nation back in may  if the lawsuit had run it course  kaepernick and reid might have lost  in this instance  settlement feel like victory for the two <BRK>bit and piece came out after the lawsuit wa filed that raised eyebrow about the nfl and it team owner  the plethora of mediocre  and in most case  worse  quarterback who were signed over kaepernick   like nathan peterman  austin davis  and mark sanchez   wa the first red flag  later  it would take reid six month to find a team  which wa odd considering he wa just a   year old pro bowl safety  then came the seven  random  drug test he received  <BRK>in the meantime  the nfl passed a rule essentially banning protest during the national anthem  then backtracked on it like an all pro cornerback after receiving negative reaction from fan and player <BRK>that external negativity toward the league never let up  while the protest weren t a visible in   a they had been the previous two seaons  many high profile people boycotted the super bowl  and musician cited the nfl s treatment of kaepernick a a reaon that they wouldn t perform during the halftime show  athlete in other sport  such a lebron james  wore kaepernick jersey during super bowl week to show their support for the quarterback <BRK>nfl owner are probably happy with this settlement  which may finally take kaepernick out of headline for them  since kaepernick took his first knee back in    they haven t been shy about wanting player to stick to football  most infamously  former texan owner bob mcnair said at the nfl meeting between player that the owner  can t have the inmate running the prison  <BRK>kaepernick knew when he started his protest that there wa a chance that he would lose his career over it  he also didn t care   this is not something that i am going to run by anybody   kaepernick said   i am not looking for approval     if they take football away  my endorsement from me  i know that i stood up for what is right   <BRK>kaepernick shouldn t have had to lose his job over standing up for the oppressed  frustration and anger still lingers because of the way he wa seemingly frozen out of the nfl for insisting that the world be a better place <BRK>but kaepernick put it all on the line anyway  because he saw an opportunity that wa bigger than him  or any individual <BRK>for reid  it felt like a miracle that he even got signed in the first place  and despite the nfl s best effort to remove him from their field  he prevailed  reid wa so good for carolina  that he signed a three year extension this offseason  through that contract  kaepernick s protest will still live on in nfl stadium <BRK>paying to keep people quiet and shove thing under the rug ha been a textbook wealthy white man move for year  nfl owner will likely sleep just fine after doling out a few million dollar   divvied up among   team   to reid and kaepernick  but the settlement is still significant  for nfl owner to take the loss and run suggests our suspicion about the jig were right all along <BRK>
