    with a bright new coach and a promising generation of young player    like christian pulisic  tyler adam  and josh sargent    the usmnt may be on the brink of a renaissance  sb nation take a look at the player and idea refueling american soccer 
   <BRK> while scrimmaging for the new york red bull before their final   regular seaon game against orlando city sc  an   year old player named ben mine had to wear a blue bib  mine had suffered a broken left clavicle at the end of august  but he recovered well enough to train with the first team  the bib marked him a a neutral player  allowing him to help whichever team had possession   <BRK> mine wa good  especially for his age  but he had the natural anxiety and inconsistency of a young player  he misplaced a few simple pass  and could get scared into avoidable mistake by defender  teammate and coach would boost his confidence by praising his creative effort  but he d defer to older player on the pitch  afraid to fail  <BRK> again  this is normal behavior for a promising young payer  and it wa in watching mine that i could tell how good tyler adam really is  <BRK> adam is only a year older than mine  but they seemed world apart  adam had a meteoric rise through the red bull system  joining the academy in    playing with the u    u    and u   side  and signing a professional contract in march   at   year old  that november  he signed with the senior team  and by the   season he wa a regular  he s still very young  but the way that he carried himself on the field made it easy to forget that   <BRK> throughout the scrimmage  adam wa a commanding presence  he wa scurrying all over the field  dribbling  tackling  and restricting space for attacker  he d yell and instruct his teammate into position  at    he didn t just look good for a   year old  or for an american    he wa just good  his talent stood out even among a team of accomplished veteran   <BRK> it s impossible not to daydream about what adam could become  when we met that day  he wa at the beginning of the next stage of his career  the transfer rumor had been swirling around him for some time  ml is a good league in it own right  but for the benefit of adam a a player and for the reputation of american player  it s important for him to go to europe and succeed in the big league and competition  in january  he joined rb leipzig of the bundesliga  making him one of the newest among   american playing in the german league  a of publication    <BRK> adam could go to germany and fail  of course   becoming the cliche of the american player who only play well near home  it s happened to many young talent before and will happen after him  but watching him  it s hard not to become hopeful  and even a little jealous  that adam could become part of a set of new story about american player abroad  to wonder if he could blossom into the great box to box player that becomes a building block for a new look usmnt  adam ha the legitimate potential for greatness   <BRK> adam and i are introduced after training  his official measurement say he s      but he look smaller  and because of that and the way he play  it s no surprise that he say his idol is n golo kante  the tiny french defensive midfielder who helped le bleu to a world cup title  like kante  adam ha a simple and gentle demeanor  he s soft spoken and personable  so that it s easy to forget just how much hype surround him  <BRK> we get in an uber together from the red bull  practice facility in east hanover  new jersey  headed to manhattan  where he is scheduled to do an event with his agent  over the course of an hour drive  the conversation weave between his fear  his ambition  and the hardship of athletic life   <BRK> when he became a professional at    his mother had to drive him   mile daily to and from training  just two year ago  he would go to school early in the morning to attend  class  that were more like individual teacher assessment so that he could attend training during the day  yet the school wa only accommodating to an extent   <BRK>  i usually go to school early in the morning for one or two class  and then come to training  the school wa ok with it  but one of the class that i wa forced to attend wa gym   adam say   i m a professional athlete but i couldn t get out of gym class   <BRK> at the same time  he battled the stigma that all young  good  american player do  the failure of freddy adu loom a a cautionary tale  even when the comparison is absurd  a soon a the transfer rumor started swirling around adam  so did the specter of adu  who wa frequently compared to pelé in the mid aught  and whose story of meager success relative to his outsized hype get rehahed whenever an american player struggle   <BRK> but that doe seems like the worst case scenario  say adam fails in europe  maybe he come back to the united state and remains a star  becoming the big fish in a small pond  or he fall another level from grace  leaving the big club for a usl team where he ha to live with several people in one house and practice in high grass  or he disappears to eastern europe to salvage what s left of his career  hope often don t become reality  and success in soccer depends on many fickle circumstance  <BRK> a my mind traced these path his life could take  one that may open and close before adam in the next few year  he remained composed a we talked  adam  reflecting his fearlessness on the pitch  showed no anxiety about the future  nor did he run away from the possibility of failure  <BRK> he acknowledged that it s impossible for american to escape adu  but unlike many  he doesn t see adu a a joke  sometimes pioneer don t succeed in the way that the audience demand  adu didn t become the american pelé like he wa hyped to be  but he gave future generation of american soccer player  like adam  hope that they could contend with anyone abroad  <BRK>  people always make fun of him  but he started all of this  he wa the first one   adam say   he paved the way for the rest of u  maybe he wan t a successful a they wanted him to be  but he deserves some respect for what he did  i don t like when they talk about him like that   <BRK> a of october  adam wa living in secaucus  new jersey  roughly   minute from the red bull  training facility  it is a quiet  suburban area  and a we drive through before hopping on the freeway  adam  who grew up in wappinger  new york  say that those two place are both more suitable to him than new york city  he like how quiet they are  that trader joe s and anything else he need is close  and that he isn t surrounded by an overwhelming number of people  he couldn t imagine living in new york city   <BRK> along with the driver  we talk about whether any of u have ever hit deer while driving  i have  the driver ha a well  but adam han t  and shake his head several time thinking about how jarring that experience would be   <BRK> when we talk about anything soccer related  adam is polished  his refined answer don t seem like the result of medium training  but of how well he know himself and his ambition   <BRK> he mix self awareness with a great level of humility  i ask him if he need to score more goal in order to gain individual recognition  <BRK>  to be honest  i don t really care about goal   he say   what i really like is shutting down the opponent s best player  i like tackle  dribbling  and getting an asist is just a good a a goal to me    <BRK> a a lifelong soccer forward  his answer is absurd to me  goal are the life blood of the game  there s no feeling in the world like scoring  research ha found that scoring goal is better than sex  at my shock  adam laugh and say   oh  you re one of those people    <BRK> he say the right thing  he respect his coach and is grateful to everyone who ha helped him on his journey  he is not under the impression that he succeeded solely because of pure individual talent  while he like playing in ml  his dream is to succeed in europe  and he feel that he is ready for the opportunity   <BRK> i ask adam what is the most important part of the game to him  what he value the most  <BRK>  winning trophy  if you don t win trophy at the end  then it wa all for nothing  that s what we play for   <BRK> there s a path where adam succeeds in europe without becoming a true superstar  too  similar to michael bradley  the national team s stalwart midfielder and longtime captain  or rather  he could take bradley s place in the usmnt  he could go to europe  and have a subjectively successful career before returning to the u s  to play out the rest of his career in relative comfort  he could become the face and leader of the national team  someone who is a stabilizing force a the team go through it iteration  he could be pivotal  even if the hype about his talent never match the reality  even if he isn t one of the world s best  he could be a hero stateside  <BRK> yet  listening to adam talk so confidently about what he know that he s capable of   that he know he can fight for his place in europe  and succeed there   he sound like someone yearning for a greater and more holistic level of recognition    <BRK> i compare his bullish attitude about europe to an incident he had with bastian schweinsteiger earlier in the season  the two of them collided in a game between the red bull and chicago fire  and when schweinsteiger tried to extend a hand to adam  the younger player waved away the bayern munich legend s peace offering   <BRK>  i respect him  but sometimes player like him act like i m supposed to bow down to them because i m young or because of who they are   adam say   i m not  i know he s a great player  but i m there to help my team win    <BRK> because of it obligation  being an athlete is a lonely path  it limit one s social life  so that when adam could have been engaging with other high school kid and living a teenage american life  he wa training with his team  moving to a new country could make those feeling of isolation even worse   <BRK> loneliness is one of the least discussed aspect in the life of professional athlete  but it is a common problem nonetheless  last year  manchester city released a documentary titled all or nothing that had few honest moment  but for one  striker sergio aguero admitting he spends most of his time away from the field alone  watching mafia movie  <BRK> the upside for adam is that in this new generation for the usmnt  many young american are moving overseas and forming their own community  adam will have an easier transition into a new culture than many of his predecessor did  mitigating the sadness he might feel  the bundesliga in particular contains a who s who of the usmnt s most promising player  including christian pulisic  weston mckennie  josh sargent  john brook  timothy chandler  fabian johnson  and bobby wood  <BRK>  i m in a group chat with a lot of those guy   adam say   we talk all the time   <BRK> but even with friend abroad  i aked if he wa still afraid of the move  of the hardship that are sure to face him off the field a much a they will on it  but again  he seemed at eae  he wa used to being alone  the experience wouldn t be new to him   <BRK>  i m not scared   adam say   i know it s going to be tough  but i ve been on my own for a while now  i m comfortable with it   <BRK> that adam might fail is a real and reasonable fear  it ha happened to countless people   not just american  but player all over the world  the sport is a graveyard of potential   <BRK> but while we sit in a car headed for manhattan  we talk about the dream of every kid who grows up a soccer player   wanting to play in a big european league  win the league trophy  win the champion league  represent their country in the world cup and lift up the most coveted trophy in the world   and the conversation wash away those fear and it feel very possible that adam could achieve so many of those dream  he doesn t just have the ability to play at the highest level  but he want to win so badly that he s willing to do anything  that obsessiveness is present in the best   <BRK> for a time we sit in silence imagining what it would be to walk out to the champion league theme song   or at least  i am and think he might be  too  just the chill of being on a grand stage like that  i ask him if he is really unafraid  it seems improbable to me  <BRK>  well  not on the field  it s just a different mentality when i step into the field   adam say   i m relaxed outside  but a soon a i m playing  i m in the zone   <BRK> so adam is a man largely without fear  then   uncompromising in his effort to help his team win  showing no deference to legend  i remind him about how jarring he said hitting a deer would have been  and if that s the case  then he ha to at least be scared of bigger and more vicious animal   <BRK>  i mean  if i wa one on one with a lion  i d probably be like  damn  guess i gotta go out like this   adam say   but besides that  i m not scared   <BRK>
