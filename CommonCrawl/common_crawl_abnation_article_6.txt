every team ha one  <BRK>it is the dreaded bad game  it is the game where nothing seems to go right  there are turnover  there are missed shot after missed shot  there is good defense by the opposition  there is a raucous crowd working against you  arguably  it looked a if purdue had already had it bad game  at maryland the second half wa brutal shooting the baketball  but at leat the first half wa pretty good a we led by   at the break  saturday night against penn state wa a sloppy  disjointed mess with   turnover  but we still won by   and scored   point  <BRK>last night at indiana wa definitely the bad game  <BRK>we had one last year  and it cost u the big ten title  on february  th we went to madison riding a two game losing streak  we had lost to ohio state on a putback and at michigan state on a deep three  but were still very much in the conference race  a few week earlier we blasted wisconsin in mackey by   point  the badger were struggling  they were basically ethan happ and four other guy  on their way to missing the ncaas for the first time in   year  <BRK>wisconsin    purdue   <BRK>the game itself wa brutal  dakota mathias only had   point and p j  thompson wa scoreless  carsen edward had    but on   field goal attempt  vince edward and isaac haas had   combined  but purdue wa never dialed in  like last night  wisconsin game the boiler every chance to run away with the game  purdue wa ahead     after five minute  then gave up a     run  purdue wa ahead     with   minute left  then hit only one field goal in the next   minute  it wa a game purdue should have won by double digit  but instead  the badger pulled off the upset  nothing went right  and it ended up costing u at least a share of the big ten title  <BRK>last night wa somehow worse  at wisconsin  purdue shot      from the floor and      from three  we still had three player in double figure and it took a   and   from happ plus   from brad davison for wisconsin to win  last night purdue wa      from the field and    from three  the only player to reach double figure wa ryan cline  who got there with a late three pointer that wa short  but had the friendly bounce up and in  romeo langford wa the only indiana player to reach double figure and he didn t even attempt a field goal in the second half  <BRK>the   point scored by purdue were just eight more than carsen scored by himself at texas and   more than he had scored on two other night this year  it wa the worst offensive output for purdue since losing     at iowa in february    that purdue team finished     and lost at eastern michigan      you have to go back to purdue s     win over wisconsin green bay in the   ncaa tournament to find the last time purdue scored le than   point and won  the last time we did it in a true road game wa a     win at iowa in   when our head coach wa   year old  <BRK>this wan t a baketball game  sure  it contained some baketball like substance in a few spot  but it wa a dismal affair where even the winning team wa going to walk away feeling like it stole something  a a purdue fan  i am mad we didn t blow them out by   becaue indiana played so poorly it wa the perfect game to pay them back for the unmerciful   point beatdown they laid on u in mackey in    indiana fan are rightly furiou this morning that they held purdue  a top   team nationally in offensive efficiency according to kenpom  to   point and it wan t enough  both team were eye bleeding bad  carsen nearly injured spectator with his brick and on one of the game s most important play  with the hoosier leading by one  juwan morgan simply fell down and slid out of bound on a drive  <BRK>still  it is a win  <BRK>sometimes that is all that matter  last year at wisconsin purdue couldn t do jut enough when the opposition wa doing everything it power to hand u the game  last night indiana wa doing even more to give u the game and we reluctantly accepted it in the form of a matt haarms tip in that might have been tipped more by morgan than haarms  <BRK>i hate to say it  but this is how big ten championship are won  they are won by somehow gritting out a game where both team combined to score le than penn state did last night  they are won by getting a favorable call and a late drive to send a game to penn state in overtime  they are won when you re down one in overtime on the road with   minute left and you find a way to win  <BRK>with five game left in the season purdue is     in the conference and leading the big ten  going     in the last five is probably enough for a share of the title  and     might even be safe  last year s team wa the one that wa supposed to win the conference  but came up just short  this year wa to be a transition year where simply making the tournament wa the goal  but now we might be able to right a wrong and get that  th big ten championship up just a year later  we re now a step closer to calling gene keady into the studio to change the intro yet again to  this is the home of   big ten championship   and if someone is smart they record him saying          etc  for later because he is   year old   <BRK>if it happens  it will be becaue we somehow  some way won a brutally ugly game     at indiana on a night when any other big ten team would have beaten u by   or more  <BRK>this is how championship are won  <BRK>
