i won t be burying the lede on this friday  the duke blue devil remain the no    overall seed on my list below  despite zion williamson exiting wednesday s blowout home loss to the north carolina tar heel with a knee injury that resulted from a blown out shoe  with the likely top pick in the nba draft  day to day  and likely to return to the court at some point this season  though whether he should do so became a hotly debated topic almost immediately after he wa helped off the cameron indoor stadium floor   i m inclined to think the blue devil will be whole again soon  <BRK> and given duke s advantage over the other contender for the top spot   a sweep of the virginia cavalier and more quality win than the tennessee volunteer and gonzaga bulldog  though the zag have a head to head win over the blue devil   i didn t see a clear alternative   <BRK> of course  if mike krzyzewski s squad is swept by the syracuse orange on saturday  the math change  that contest will be played under

an increasing number of team have locked up a bid since last friday  remember that to be considered a  lock   a team can lose each and every game it will play between now and selection sunday and

gone from possible protected seed to the   to   seed range  it s a similar story for louisville  which ha won just two of it lat six  baylor s win at iowa state bought the bear a little more breathing room  while syracuse s victory over the aforementioned cardinal will help the orange a they work their way through the most difficult portion of their schedule   <BRK> even though   team fall within

this week  mike white s squad find themselves above the dayton bound group they couldn t even crack on tuesday  vcu extended it win streak to seven by absolutely annihilating a rhode island squad it fell to on the road a few week ago  and with davidson losing at home to dayton on tuesday  mike rhoades  club is now the lone atlantic   team in the field   <BRK> providence s sweep of st  john s cost the red storm some positioning after the johnny defeated butler and villanova  while ole miss also slid a bit following a loss at south carolina  even though the gamecock are fourth in the sec  ohio

to xavier both dropped them a seed line today  however  the fact the golden gopher have won just one of their last six game is a far more troubling trend for their hope  nc state avoided disaster at home against boston college  winning after overtime on wednesday  while arizona state had no trouble with stanford at home  <BRK> last four in  no   s   first four      tcu               ucf

bison in the field for now  thanks to the quality of the team behind them  however  i don t think that a two bid atlantic sun will be a reality in three week  time  that s because lipscomb s defeat handed control of the conference race to liberty   now one loss up in the standing  and with the aun tournament being hosted by higher seed all the way through  that might give the flame an advantage  but that s not a given a the pair split their seaon series  with each winning on the other s home floor   <BRK> ucf missed a major opportunity to shore up it candidacy in cincinnati lat night  while tcu get one on saturday when iowa state visit fort worth  the horned frog already shocked the cyclone in ames two week ago  a for utah state  a trip to boise state and visit from san diego state are

recently and alabama following saturday s home loss to florida by being swept by a bad texa a m squad  georgetown look like the team from the first four out group that s best positioned to make a move  wednesday s   point home win over villanova pushed the hoya to     in the big eat  while that s not impressive  they now sit just a half game behind     st  john s and seton hall  and that pair is currently tied for third in the top heavy league  with two game against depaul and a saturday trip to creighton left  along with a chance at avenging a   point road loss to the pirate and a regular seaon finale at marquette  patrick ewing s club will have opportunity to establish itself a the third best team in the conference  the question is whether they can play with the consistency needed to do so  <BRK> furman host neighbor wofford  a team it lost to by five on the road  on saturday  and with the terrier ranked in the net s top    the paladin have a shot at adding a second group   win to a profile that already feature a win at villanova  clemson need to snap it three game skid quickly  though beating boston college at home on saturday won t do much for their bid prospect  saint mary s  which held pacific to   point on thursday  is working toward next saturday s visit from gonzaga  while murray state look to be cruising to a bye to the ovc tournament semifinal    <BRK>    south

penn state all but ended the huskers  at large hope  while oregon state and oregon both cost themselves position with their respective thursday loss to ucla and usc   <BRK> but there s one team here that will definitely give the selection committee headache and that s the first one listed   south carolina  the gamecock won just five of their   non conference game this year  while the eight loss feature some very respectable name in clemson  michigan  providence  virginia and wofford  frank martin s team also lost to the stony brook seawolves   th in the net  and wyoming cowboy   th   the sec big   challenge didn t even provide a respite  a the gamecock fell at oklahoma state in that event   <BRK> while south carolina ably portrayed mr  hyde in non league play  the team ha also aced the dr  jekyll role in the sec  conference play ha provided the gamecock with three group   win and four top   victory  in fact  if the season ended today  they d own the no    seed in the sec tournament   and the bye to the quarterfinal that come with it  and with just two of carolina s remaining opponent being at large threat  such an ending is quite possible  but the lack of late quality win opportunity and bad non conference result really limit the gamecock  at large hope  <BRK> no   s     belmont                liberty                new mexico state            <BRK> no   s     yale
