stephen curry will probably go down a the greatest shooter in nba history  it s actually already written  if reggie miller say it  it must be true  <BRK> but brooklyn net guard joe harris is a better shooter than stephen curry  both by percentage this year and now by beating him in the   point shootout   <BRK> san antonio s davis bertans is the only player with a higher three point percentage than harris entering the all star break  and harris ha made   more triple than bertans on   more attempt  he s an expert marksman while taking a high volume of triple  <BRK> so it should have been no surprise that harris put up   point in the first round  then   in the second round before hoisting the trophy after saturday night s   point shootout  without any defense  it should have been no surprise that harris made   out of   shot  including   money ball   <BRK>
