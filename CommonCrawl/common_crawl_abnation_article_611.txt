on sunday night  francis ngannou made quick work of cain velasquez  knocking out the former two time ufc heavyweight champion in just   second at ufc phoenix  after the biggest win of his career  ngannou began lobbying for a title shot  saying that heavyweight champion daniel cormier  should come to avenge his teammate   unfortunately for ngannou  it doesn t look like that will be in the card for him  <BRK> speaking with espn after the fight  ufc president dana white revealed that the ufc already ha an opponent lined up cormier  <BRK>  well yeah  francis is there   white said   cormier s hurt right now and we have another fight lined up for cormier first so  we ll see how this whole thing play out   <BRK> when cormier won the title at ufc    a superfight with brock lesnar wa immediately teased  however  despite lesnar rejoining usada in july  there ha been little discussion about his impending return  leaving even cormier to wonder if the fight with happen  meanwhile  cormier ha been dealing with injury since his heavyweight title defense against derrick lewis at ufc    leaving who is is fighting next completely up in the air and dana white did not care to illuminate either  <BRK>   cormier  is not healthy yet so i would never announce a fight without it being done   white said when questioned about the opponent for cormier   it make no sense  i don t even know when cormier s gonna be ready   <BRK> cormier is currently sidelined with a back injury and just last week announced that he would be pushing back his planned retirement date while he recovers   <BRK> result  francis ngannou finish cain velasquez in opening minute at ufc phoenix  <BRK> result  matt mitrione v  sergei kharitonov end in no contest after low blow at bellator    <BRK>
