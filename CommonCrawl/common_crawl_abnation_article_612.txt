i m honestly quite excited to see ed oliver develop on the next level because i m pretty sure he is about to take a huge leap forward a a player in the nfl  <BRK> oliver played the hell out of a zero nose in college  but i don t think anyone belief that s where he ll be playing a a professional  <BRK> that isn t to say that he didn t do a good job there  hell  he did a fantastic job most of the time  but at his size  and with his power  speed  and quickness  nfl team are a lot more likely to have him lined up out in the b gap  or wider  instead  <BRK> i don t want to say using him so much at zero nose wa a wate of his talent at houston  but i cannot tell a lie  i m sure the coach had their reaon  but i doubt i would agree with any of them  with a many play a he made from a zero nose  i have a feeling he would have been way more ridiculous if it had been in a three technique or a four technique on a more regular bais  <BRK> the shame of it all is that in the four game i watched oliver  with all of his impressive physical tool  he wa rarely put in position to just fire straight off the ball and get upfield to create havoc  that wa more than just a little bit frustrating for me a an analyst  <BRK> here you have a guy who is killing people with his quickness on one play  then dumping them on their as with his power on the next  but he had to do all these wondrous thing from mostly either heavy or head up alignment in the game that i watched  what i mean by that is that he wa either aligned head up on an offensive lineman  which isn t a good alignment for trying to fire off upfield  or he wa in a  heavy  alignment  that mean he wa technically shaded to one side or the other  like a  i on the inside half of the guard  but it wan t much of a shade and he wa still staring across at least a half a man when he wa in his stance  <BRK> again  i m sure his coaching staff had their reason  but selfishly i would have liked to have seen oliver lined up in the gap a helluva lot more  it would have put him in much better position to really showcase the totality of his talent  which would have in turn allowed him to make even more big play  which also probably would have translated into more success for his team  in general  <BRK> a the song go  however  we can t always get what we want  so instead i just have to go by what i did see  and then try to extrapolate from there when projecting who and what i think oliver should be on the next level  i will say that even with all my bellyaching  this kid wa a joy to watch on film   <BRK> let s talk about his explosion right off the bat  because that one of the first thing that jumped off the screen at me  <BRK> i hardly ever see a nose tackle who consistently ha the best get off on his defensive line  but with oliver it wasn t even close on most play  he d be off the ball and engaging with the opposing offensive linemen while his teammate were still stuck in their stance  <BRK> and not only wa he quick off the ball  but his explosion also wa readily apparent in how forcefully he took on blocker  when team made the mistake of trying to block oliver one on one  he wa routinely able to rock that blocker back by getting good hand placement inside on their breast plate  getting full extension with his arm  and exploding out of his hip   <BRK> i just didn t see many play where one guy got him pushed off the ball  the overwhelming majority of the time he sent them flying backward  at leat initially  i can t be sure how many time oliver will be able to bench press   pound at the combine  but what i do know is on film he play like he is strong a a damn ox  i literally saw him take an offensive lineman and use him to tackle a running back for a loss of   yard in one game  <BRK> no matter what his combine number turn out to be  it s pretty clear on tape he is plenty strong enough to play in the league  in fact  if a team wanted to use him from time to time at zero nose  i m pretty sure he would hold up well there in the nfl  too  the dude showed the athletic trait that will give him at least the potential for being a really dominant player against the run in the pro   <BRK> but  before you get the wrong idea  oliver is not some big  lumbering goon on the field  a impressive a his display of strength and power were in the four game that i watched  his lateral quickness wa just a remarkable   <BRK> houston had him stunting laterally quite a bit  and he wa excellent at it  he wa so quick that he could often make center or guard completely whiff when they tried to block him  then he d immediately stick his foot in the ground and shoot upfield looking to take whomever had the ball down behind the line of scrimmage   <BRK> it wa actually oliver s unique combination of power and quickness that allowed him to hold up so well playing zero nose a much a he did  even though he isn t a huge guy by any mean at     and   pound  playing inside like that  and just because he wa a badas in college  oliver had to face a ton of double team and other kind of extra attention  and it didn t seem to bother him one bit  <BRK> when he recognized a double team  he would smartly come off hard at one guy to try to knock him back and create separation before the second guy could get over and try to join the party  <BRK> on several occaion  that allowed him to not only hold his ground but also eventually split those double team without being moved off the ball very much  if at all  he also employed this technique a a pas rusher to pretty good effect  a well  <BRK> i still don t think houston should ve played him at nose tackle a much a it did in those game  but there is no question that he balled out when he wa lined up there  of course on the occaions when the coach had him aligned wider  he balled the f out there  too  he wa always playing on the opponent s side of the line of scrimmage  and while he wan t always the guy who ended up making the tackle for a loss  he wa often the guy who forced it  <BRK> in addition to his power and quickness  another thing i wa impressed with wa how active and effective oliver wa with his hand  a lot of guy with his physical tool are good college player  but end up failing on the next level because they never work on escaping off block  it s simply too easy for them to make play in college most week  so they never really hone their technique  i see it every year from a prospect or two that i do a breakdown on  and it is never not infuriating to watch  <BRK> in oliver s case  however  he generally did a really good job of using his hand to keep blocker off of him  he wa also really good at using escape move like rip and arm over to get off of the blocker once it wa time for him to try to make a tackle  <BRK> that s truly a big deal for me and something i look for and value when i m evaluating defensive line prospect  because that will translate over well for oliver in the nfl   <BRK> no matter what level of competition you face  using good technique will always give you a better chance of making play  at some point you are always going to meet your match physically  and it is those instance when you need good technique the most  if you are used to just reaching out and trying to tackle somebody without escaping off the block because you used to be able to get away with it in college  you will surely wind up getting dumptrucked when you face better competition in the nfl  <BRK> but that isn t something a team will have to worry about with oliver  for the most part  <BRK> a much a anything  the reaon why i wa most disappointed that houston didn t see fit to line oliver up in the gap more is because i just didn t get to see oliver on many play a a true pas rusher in the four game i watched  oh  he still managed to get some heat on the opposing quarterback and although he didn t end up with any sack in those four game  he did still end up with nine pressure   <BRK> but most of those were on play where he wan t in a gap alignment and they usually came on early down  that he wa able to be that productive a a pas rusher wa a great testament to how good of a player he wa in spite of the scheme he wa playing in  <BRK> on third down sometimes  houston had oliver stunting laterally to go from the a gap to being the containment element of the defense  either because of a blitz or a three man rush  that s what we used to call a  hot  stunt   <BRK> and if you were confused about this  most of the time the player running those stunt from the a gap or b gap to being the containment element of the defense are not meant to get any pressure on the quarterback  all they are supposed to do is even up the pas rush lane and  in the event of a blitz  make sure the quarterback can t escape outside  away from where the blitz is coming  <BRK> just based on the limited pas rushing rep i did see from oliver  he looked to be one of your best  if not your best  pas rusher  but you don t allow him to get up the field to pas rush  <BRK> what part of the game is that  <BRK> i just don t get it   <BRK> it seems to me it would have been so much easier to just line him up at three technique on most third down  let him destroy one of the guard and maybe the center  and allow the other guy to play off him  even if he didn t have a single decent pas rush move  with his skill set oliver would have likely killed most of the offensive guard he faced just with his quickness and power  <BRK> after seeing how team tried to double him all the time  even when he wasn t the three technique  at the very least he could ve have drawn enough attention that his teammate would have had an easier time trying to get to the quarterback   <BRK> the crazy thing is watching how good he wa with his hand in other situation and even on some of his pas rush rep from inside  i m pretty sure oliver doe have some pretty good pas rush move  but he just wan t put in position to showcase them all that much  at least not in the four game i watched  <BRK> well  aside from his bull rush  which  unsurprisingly  he wa very effective with   <BRK>

   <BRK> from what i have seen  oliver already ha all the trait of a good interior pas rusher  and  with a little bit of technique work  there is a decent chance he could eventually develop into a great one   <BRK> one of the biggest reaon i feel really good about oliver a a prospect is because the guy hustled his as off on the field  if you have read any of my work  you know how much i admire a guy who mahes the ga to the ball constantly  and this guy kept showing up down the field on film  <BRK> oliver wan t just getting in some cardio  either  he wa looking to take cat  head off  i saw the guy hauling as over   yard down the field and making the tackle on one play  <BRK> i also saw him chase down a screen from behind and blow up the running back on the tackle   <BRK> when you have a guy with that kind of motor  i feel like it shouldn t be that hard to get him coached up a little in the technique department  oliver isn t exactly  raw  to begin with  so it s not like he is going to have to start from scratch   <BRK> hell  right now  today  he already ha shown me some pretty good power move  for all i know he may well already have some fantatic finesse move a well   <BRK> but even if he doesn t  i see nothing on his film that lead me to believe oliver can t learn some move develop into a top notch interior pas rusher in the nfl  and when it come to defensive linemen in this era of football  that s what it s all about   <BRK> it s pretty much a given for me that oliver will be outstanding against the run in the nfl  but  a i have said before  i really don t value one trick run defender on the defensive line enough to take one in the first round  for me to take a guy that high he ha to be able to get after the paser  so there is at leat some risk with oliver in that i didn t actually see him pas rush the way i think he will be able to when he is put in better alignment  but my doubt on that front are pretty low  <BRK> on another note  i heard an announcer in one of the game compare him to aaron donald  but their pa rush film is one of the major difference between oliver and donald coming out of college  when i did donald s breakdown back in the day  i actually saw him move up and down the line whupping a a a pa rusher  in fact  donald wa one of the most polished pa rusher i ve ever seen coming out of college   <BRK> so i don t think it s fair to put those kind of expectation on oliver  while i believe he will eventually do well a a pas rusher  folk have to give him time to develop  and i fear with the comparison to donald people will rush to call him a bust if he isn t racking up sack right out of the gate   <BRK> the truth of the matter is donald is a generational talent  he may well be the best interior defensive lineman to ever play the game when his career is all said and done  oliver doesn t need to be judged by such a high bar right now when he isn t close to being a polished a donald wa when he came out  and  quite frankly  most other defensive line prospect shouldn t have that comparison hung around their neck  either   <BRK> i ll tell you who oliver actually doe remind me of and that s robert nkemdiche back when he wa at his best in college   <BRK> the quickness   <BRK> the explosiveness   <BRK> the power   <BRK> both guy are very similar football trait wise and not far off when it come to their physical dimension  where oliver separate himself from nkemdiche is he already play with better technique  play in and play out  and with more discipline than nkemdiche ever did  oliver  right now  is already who a lot of people  myself included  thought nkemdiche could eventually develop into  i know nkemdiche ha been disappointing so far a a pro  but i m not making the comparison a a knock on oliver  <BRK> it s been a while  but plenty of folk thought nkemdiche would be a beast on the next level when he came out of school  i m saying that i see oliver a similar prospect who is already closer to being a beast than nkemdiche wa when he wa drafted in the first round   <BRK> and  again  i think oliver still ha a lot of room to grow  so his ceiling should actually be higher than nkemdiche s heading into the league  oliver also  to my knowledge  doesn t have anything like the off field baggage that came with nkemdiche  either   <BRK> that being said  oliver will still need to test and measure well at the combine before we will see just how high his stock will go  for me  he look like a top half of the first round guy on tape  but we all know how the nfl love measurables  <BRK> no matter how high or low he is picked  i see oliver a a pretty safe prospect  he is both stout and athletic enough to play multiple position on the defensive line  he ha plenty of functional strength  and he ha a motor that won t quit  barring injury or something unforeseen off the field  oliver ha the potential to be a pro bowl type guy by his third year in the league  and i don t think any team that draft him will end up being disappointed that it did   <BRK> for the purpose of this breakdown i watched former houston defensive lineman ed oliver play against rice  arizona  texas tech  and memphis  those represented the first  second  third  and  th game on houston s schedule last season  respectively  <BRK>
