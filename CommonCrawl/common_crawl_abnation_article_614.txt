head coach  chuck martin       sixth year  <BRK>   record and s p  ranking        th  <BRK> projected   record and s p  ranking        rd  <BRK> five key point  <BRK> one fact of life that becomes more true to me with each passing year is that we are all paradox in some way  the factor that give u our best trait also give u our worst  <BRK> in football term  miami  ohio  head coach chuck martin might be the most perfect example of this  in his five season with the redhawks  he ha proven to be one of the country s most methodical program builder  <BRK> when he moved to oxford  miami wa at an all time low point  <BRK> by the end of    he wa fielding a top   team for the second straight season  miami hadn t advanced that high in s p  since    that is undeniable  if relatively slow  success  but those same conservative  inch at a time tendency that have served miami well in the macro sense have backfired quite a bit in the micro  <BRK> in five season under martin  the redhawks have gone     in one possession game  the word  conservative  take a darker tone here in the way that miami appears to aim for risk free  sure to punt play calling  <BRK> maybe the best recent example of this come from one of their rare close win  <BRK> late in the   season  riding a close game losing streak of nine straight dating back to the woefully conservative     loss to mississippi state in the   st  petersburg bowl  the redhawks exploded to a     halftime lead over an excellent ohio  the defense had forced four punt and a turnover  but there wa reason to believe that ohio could still make a charge   the bobcat were averaging     yard per play  after all   plus  in general  they had a really good offense  more than capable of scoring   or more point in the second half   miami s offensive success  meanwhile  had been driven by the pas  gu ragland wa   for   for   yard and a touchdown  <BRK> ragland threw   pass in the second half  almost all of them conservative   and he completed four for   yard  ohio averaged     yard per play in the second half to miami s      the redhawks went three and out five time in seven possession  the other two  a five and out and a turnover   and sure enough  ohio had cut miami s lead to      then got the ball back with   second left and a chance to win with a field goal  <BRK> the bobcat came up about   yard short of a field goal attempt  and the redhawks held on after doing everything wrong  <BRK> but they were still talented enough to beat a good team  and they turned around and beat eventual mac champ niu the next week a well  they won five of seven to finish the year bowl eligible for the second time in three seaons  miami had been to only one bowl in nine year before his arrival  so that s not nothing  but the same methodical approach that ha led to a steady build ha kept the win total tamped down  among active coach  he s at the bottom of the in game underachiever list  <BRK> so is he a bad good coach  a great terrible one  <BRK> either way  he s miami s for another year  and at first glance  this five year streak of steady improvement is in danger  ragland  his two leading running back  two of his four favorite target  and the left side of the offensive line are all gone from a unit that ha still climbed only a high a  th in off  s p  under martin  the defense return some play maker but must replace about half it two deep and do everything linebacker brad koenig  <BRK> martin just signed the third best clas in the mac  and the foundation look a healthy a ever  but you have to wonder if the missed opportunity through the year have soured his accomplishment a bit  and you have to wonder what might happen to the relationship if or when the redhawks actually take a step backwards at some point  we might find out this year  <BRK>

   <BRK> if miami could run the ball on you in    you were probably screwed  not including ragland  who would attempt about six non sack carry per game  the redhawks had four primary ball carrier  alonzo smith  kenny young  also ragland s second most frequent target   maurice thomas  and jaylen bester  they were just slightly more effective in win than loss  <BRK> if the run worked  offensive co coordinator george barnett and eric koehler would ride it pretty far  if it didn t  they d ditch it quickly and ask ragland to save them   ragland would then frequently dump the ball to one of the back on the perimeter   <BRK> smith and young are gone after combining for   intended touch  rush and pa target   but thoma and bester    combined  played a role a well  and bester wa maybe the most exciting to watch of the foursome  on a per intended touch bais  he wa the second most dangerous behind young  <BRK> bester and thoma should expect to play a pretty large role this year  a miami doesn t really seem to believe in the intermediate pases  ragland s successor   be it michigan transfer alex malzone or one of many three star youngster  sophomore jackson williamson  redshirt freshman aj mayer or michael bond  or true freshman brett gabbert    will be aked to throw baically screen  flare     and lot of go route  <BRK> the best go route option might be a tight end  junior andrew homer should probably be asked to play a larger role after catching   of   pass for   yard and three score  his vertical presence could distract safety and prevent them from keying on a couple of target on the outside  jack sorenson    yard  two touchdown  is easily the most well rounded of miami receiver  while tight end sized luke mayock    yard  three tds  is a unique matchup  <BRK> sorenson and mayock are the only two returnees who caught more than   pass last year  but player like homer  junior dominique robinson  another big target   sophomore jalen walker  and a boatload of three star youngster could be ready for larger role  <BRK> the line ha to replace two starter in lt jordan rigg and lg sam mccollum but still feature four player who have combined for   career start  two year starting center danny godlevske wa third team all mac in    <BRK> despite some thinning out on the two deep  there appears to be decent talent here  we just have to find out if there s a quarterback  malzone  a former four star prospect  ha attempted four career pass and ha completed zero  he s the most experienced guy here  there s plenty of potential in the fact that martin and his co coordinator will have five former three  or four star prospect to choose from  but someone still ha to step up  <BRK> a daily ish mini column on the college football thing of the day  with some other stuff too  <BRK> despite the fact that he is a former offensive coordinator  martin s team have been driven mostly by defense   the redhawks have ranked quite a bit higher in def  s p  than in off  s p  for each of the past four year  they were  th this past season  a unit defined not by any one overriding strength but by a lack of outright weakness  they were  th in marginal efficiency   th in marginal explosiveness  and between  th and  th in rushing  passing  standard down and passing down s p   <BRK> the balance here make me feel better about their chance to deal with loss  defensive co coordinator spence nowinsky and john hauser have to replace three of their top seven linemen  two of three linebacker  and two of three safety  <BRK> one loss doe bear a lot of weight  though  koenig wa one of the best linebacker in the country at any level  he led the team in tackle     nearly double anyone else s on the team   tackle for loss      run stuff      and forced fumble  four   and he wa second in sack  five  and third in pass defensed  five   losing him is like losing two good player  <BRK> they do still return proven talent at each level of the defense  though  <BRK> the offense ha question mark  but i d be surprised if the miami defense wasn t again one of the best in the conference  <BRK> in a conference weighed down by lot of bad special team unit  miami s wa a happy standout  the redhawks  unit wa a balanced a their defense  ranking in the top   in kick return efficiency and in the top   in place kicking  punting  and kickoff  <BRK> better yet  those responsible for all of those positive rating are scheduled to return   punter kyle kramer  kicker samuel sloman  and a pair of dangerous return men in maurice thomas and jaylen bester  this should again be the best unit in the conference  <BRK> martin s program building strength have been strong enough to put his in game weakness in the spotlight  despite miami s obvious gain  the redhawks are just     the last three season  and with just a    record in close game  they d be at something closer to seven win a year with three bowl bid  <BRK> this is probably another season that will be defined by close game  s p  project three double digit win for the redhawks  home game against bgsu  akron  and tennessee tech   three double digit loss  road game against iowa  cincinnati  and ohio state   and six one possession tossup  if miami either executes better or receives better break  then there s enough talent here  especially on defense  to make a conference title run  <BRK> but history suggests the redhawks will only win one or two of those six close game  that could mean another year without a bowl  <BRK> if martin s been saving all of his close game karma for a good moment  now would be the time to spend some of it  there is both a lot of opportunity  and a lot of threat  on the table  <BRK> all   preview data to date  <BRK>
