when you close the tab that hold this article  i want you to close your eye and exhale  counting to four  then i want you to inhale  counting to four  repeat three time  you re done with the hall of fame for month  you re free  <BRK> until then  eat your hall of fame content  it s filled with fiber   <BRK> i have fewer thought about the hall of fame this year because the thought aren t much different from year to year  barry bond and roger clemens still aren t in  i m still very much into the idea of edgar martinez s election  the only new wrinkle this year were mariano rivera and roy halladay  two player whose candidacy made me scream  yes  before getting to their second name  maybe this is why i don t have a vote  i wa so eager that i would have voted for mariano duncan and roy face   <BRK> still  there are best and worst from the   hall of fame vote that deserve closer scrutiny  unanimous vote  michael young  edgar  edgar  do you hear me  edgar  <BRK> the anti dh bias   and to a lesser extent  anti closer bias   ha been one of the most obnoxious component of hall of fame voting for year  baseball decided almost   year ago that half the team in the league would get a position that could be filled by a hitter who doesn t have to play in the field  player adapted to this position  they built career around it  team acquired player to play this position  in the hope of making a better baseball team than their opponent   <BRK> there s a whole ecosystem built around the dh  see  it s incredibly silly to pretend that a position doesn t qualify for the hall of fame because it s an impure or unworthy position  allow me to quote myself from an argument for edgar martinez from    <BRK> there is a position called the designated hitter  it s in the rule and everything  therefore  those baseball player should be eligible for the baseball hall of fame  you don t get to remove the gannet from olsen s standard book of british bird because they wet their nest  and you don t get to eliminate dhs entirely from the hall of fame  <BRK> mostly  though  edgar martinez s induction is validation of a brilliant career  he wa such an artist  such a savant with the bat for so long  if the dh didn t exist  buddy  team would have put him in center field if they needed to  and while that would have messed up his war and caused an entirely new conversation  the argument for his inclusion would remain the same  dude wa one of the best player to ever swing a bat   <BRK> on tuesday  because i m bad at my job  i wrote a column about how the ballot wa a little easier to navigate this year  i m a going back in to make correction after this is finished  but i screwed up  at some point  i deleted a big portion of my list  whether because of a copy and paste mistake or fat thumb  which mean i thought that i had a list of   player who deserve induction  or at least serious consideration  but i had erased gary sheffield and andruw jones  both of whom should probably get in based on talent alone  even though i just learned that jones wa arrested for allegedly assaulting his wife  which certainly mean the character clause come into play   this mean   player should have been on that list   <BRK> except  wait  i also forgot about lance berkman and roy oswalt  i ll have more on them in a bit   they deserved consideration  at the very least  i m still curious about billy wagner  too  and andy pettitte deserves better than the bernie williams jorge posada treatment  where writer overcorrect for brilliant yankee player with ridiculously long and productive career   <BRK> i wouldn t vote for omar vizquel  but he belongs in the conversation  and i think you should click on this related link  <BRK>

   <BRK> so there were   player who at least deserved serious consideration  now there are   left  and next year  we get     <BRK> that s one for sure hall of famers and three probably nots  but it puh u back to an annoying ballot again  with berkman and oswalt falling off  though  it s a little better  at least numerically  there will be   to consider next year  with   of those player probably getting my fake vote  which mean at least one person get hosed   <BRK> but     that s not bad  especially when that one person is probably curt schilling  patron saint of sitting in a corner and thinking about what he s done   <BRK> the logjam is getting better  it s about time   <BRK> it s le offensive to me that babe ruth and willie may weren t unanimous than it is that joe dimaggio needed four ballot  although that is a fascinating story of bumblescrewery and general weirdness   but people really had a thing about the idea of a unanimous ballot  my philosophy ha always been that if you get   people in a room  one of them will believe that tupac is still alive  another one will think we probably didn t land on the moon  and another one will think that derek jeter s defense should keep him out of the hall   <BRK> that s just how human work  so when you get   writer sending ballot  there will be outlier  the kubrick directed the moon landing of ballot  if you will  don t like it  root for the robot revolution  i know that i am   <BRK> but some people just wouldn t let this go  and they kept on about it  is this guy the first unanimous inductee  is this guy  what about this guy  it wa tiresome   <BRK> now we have a guy  everyone agrees we landed on the moon  y all  finally  mariano rivera saved u  pun absolutely intended  we can stop talking about it   <BRK> now we just have to deal with the debate about every subsequent candidate who should be unanimous  will jeter be unanimous  albert pujols  mike trout  hopefully rivera will ease the mind of weirdo who didn t vote for obvious first balloters because of ruth and may  now that the seal ha been broken  maybe everyone will consider the candidate on their merit  which is a strange concept  i know   <BRK>  i totally would have been the guy to leave rivera off my ballot strategically to give a vote of support for oswalt and berkman  and my day today would have been absolutely ruined  it s probably a good thing i don t have a vote   <BRK> i love these vote  if only becaue it reminds u that people can devote their entire life to watching baseball and come to a remarkably different concluion than all of u  here s an actual jutification for the polanco vote  it ues fielding percentage  sure  but it s honest  and i appreciate the willingness to be aggressive with an unpopular opinion   <BRK>  whisper  placido polanco had a more valuable career than harold baines  according to baseball reference  <BRK> well  uh  yeah  but     look  i don t have an answer to that  maybe bill madden is onto something  let  em all in   <BRK> still  i like the idea of voting your heart and letting the mass sort it out  if   percent of the people saw the same thing about polanco  i ll reevaluate  it beat taking whatever the today s new era game of tomorrow today committee shovel at u   <BRK> my fix is this  a today s era of game played then committee that s   or   deep  they can have a nice conference somewhere  with presentation and cocktail shrimp  they can talk and mingle and lobby in the lobby   <BRK> but nothing is wrong with a writer throwing a stray vote to a definite non hall of famer because he or she see something  it give me something to write about  <BRK> i wa a latecomer to the idea that larry walker is a hall of famer  partly because i had a longstanding bias against oft injured player that wa hard to shake  i wan t thinking about the   game in which they helped their team more than almost any one of their peer could have  i wa thinking about the remaining    when their team wa scrambling and playing someone fresh off the triple a shuttle   <BRK> barry larkin changed my mind  i think  now i m all about player like walker  which is a group that includes scott rolen and will clark  the trick is they have to cram more value into their healthy day  which all of these player did  billy wagner in his prime wa better and harder to replace than trevor hoffman  and we should adjust for that  while also adjusting for hoffman s reliability and longevity    <BRK> walker jumped from     percent to     percent this year  which mean he s riding the tim raines express into his final year of eligibility  i m not sure if he squeak in  but his odds are much better than they were  and he ll become the cause célèbre of next year s ballot   <BRK> walker played for the rockies for   year  averaging   game with a   ops   which is significantly better than the ops  that allowed nolan arenado to finish third in this year s nl mvp voting  that s a decade of hitting at roughly an mvp level  so what if he missed a month  on average  sport car need more time in the shop  but they re still freaking sport car  <BRK> pretty sure that at least   percent of the voting bloc is completely and irrevocably against the best hitter and pitcher from the last   year  if not ever  getting into the hall of fame  it s not going to happen   <BRK> there s no sense rehashing argument i ve made over and over again  but i hold firm that a museum that suggests harold baines is a major component of baseball s living history and barry bond is not is a dumb museum  and we should laugh at it   <BRK>  also bond ha also been accused of repeated abuse and clemens reportedly had an extended affair with a   year old girl  so maybe it s okay to stop caring so much  everything is awful   <BRK> hall of famers  look  i don t know  you can play the he s better than this other hall of famer game with both  of course  you take jack morris  i ll take oswalt  and my team will win more game  same with jim rice and berkman  it s at least worth debating their merit   <BRK> except  poof  both are off the ballot after one year  do we not remember how good these two were  from   through    oswalt averaged   inning with a        era    doing so in the thick of the steroid era while being much  much smaller than his peer  he finished in the top five for cy young voting five time in that span  leading the league in era  whip  win  and strikeout to walk ratio in different year   <BRK> he didn t lat long enough to be a hall of famer  probably  two more year  maybe three  and i m beating that drum  a is  i get it   <BRK> we deserved to debate this a little longer  though  he wa so very excellent  now i m almost sorry that i wan t the guy who omitted rivera to cast a vote for oswalt   <BRK> berkman wa merely one of the greatest switch hitter of all time  sure  he wa far weaker against lefty  but he made up for it by being a deity against righties  in nine season  he had an ops over     with an ops  over    and more than   at bat  he had   season with more than   plate appearance  and he raked in absolutely all of them  his defense wa  uh  galootish  which tempered his value substantially   <BRK> i m not sure if berkman is a hall of famer  but he s kind of the answer to the question   what would have happened if edgar martinez had to play in the field   he wa one of the best hitter of his generation  and his career deserved better than to fall off the first ballot   <BRK> this is worth bonus point  too  <BRK> berkman is also an intolerant dingus  so good riddance in a way  except i m not someone who considers the hall of fame to be a reward given to a specific player  but rather a cataloguing of the very best player in baseball history  here s who helped their team win the most  here s who made fan enjoy baseball game the most  once we figure that out  we can stand in front of their plaque and call them intolerant dinguses  which seems more effective and educational than pretending they don t exist   <BRK> regardless  i would have liked to debate the on field merit of both oswalt and berkman for longer  both of them are close to hall of fame quality  both of their career deserved better  the curse of the overstuffed ballot struck  however  and there wa no mercy  <BRK> mostly  though  it wa a fine ballot  edgar  halladay  mussina  and mariano are all no doubter for me  which mean that in two decade  i can look back at this class without cringing  they all belong  that s almost certainly the best part  and we should celebrate it   <BRK>
