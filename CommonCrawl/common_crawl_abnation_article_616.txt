major league baseball s  opening day  is set for march    but the season kick off bright and early wednesday morning when the oakland athletics face the seattle mariner in the tokyo dome  the al west rival will play two game in tokyo before returning to america to wrap up spring training <BRK>the westgate superbook released win total for all   mlb team  and before we get into best bet across the board  we wanted to take a look at the a s and mariner specifically  the a s are installed at   win  while the mariner are at      by comparison  fangraph s projection have the a s at   win and the mariner at   win <BRK>we chatted with alex hall from athletics nation and kate preusser from lookout landing to get their thought on the win total  both see big question mark with their team  but believe the state of their roster coupled with the state of the bottom of the division open the door for both team to hit the over on relatively low number <BRK>the a s are a tough team to peg entering this season  a lot went right for them to win   game in    and they lost one of their all star in jed lowrie over the winter  so it s easy to see an argument for them falling back significantly from that total  but they also have a few legitimate star on hand  plus a deep lineup and bullpen that mask their weak rotation  and there are a few more top   caliber prospect expected to arrive this summer  <BRK>preseason projection system tend to be conservative  and that s probably the safest way for oakland fan to approach thing emotionally after last year s unexpected  exciting run  however  from a betting perspective  the westgate superbook mark of   win seems like a worst case scenario  and a lot would have to go wrong for the a s to lose that much ground  the main question are whether you think they can overcome a lackluster starting rotation once more  at a time when rotation are decreasing in importance around the league   and how much you believe in the young talent led by matt chapman  who finished seventh in mvp voting last summer   i d bet the over on   win  without thinking twice <BRK>the mariner at     sound a little low to u  especially given that the ranger and angel are probably worse squad  while the mariner  starting pitching is no great shake and the bullpen is most likely dreadful  we like marco gonzales the best out of any starter in the al west  non astros edition  if the a s promote jesu luzardo  that will change  but right now we like marco  kikuchi  a surprisingly effective wade leblanc  and the ever reliable if not spectacular mike leake more than the rotation currently posited by the a s  ranger  and the ohtani le angel  who also have a hurt andrew heaney  <BRK>the offensive upside for the mariner  even without kyle seager  is also maybe only third worst in the west  behind the astros and a s  the mariner might be without seager for a while but the ranger will be without adrian beltre forever  and while mitch haniger isn t mike trout  he s also surrounded by a stronger supporting cast  especially outfield mate domingo santana  whom the brewer inexplicably traded to the mariner for ben gamel  the edwing might be bent slightly  but jay bruce ha bounded into seattle with a spring in his step and dingers in his bat  we re not fooling ourselves that this   mariner team will be good   the team is still rebuilding   but in an anemic al west    plus win doesn t seem out of the question <BRK>
