nothing is more dangerous than the golden state warrior taking thing personally  the moment that they decide to be at their best is akin to a death sentence for the opposing team <BRK>on tuesday night  the warrior played the role of judge  jury  and executioner  the perceived crime  the recent surge of success by the denver nugget  who have taken it upon themselves to seize first place in the western conference <BRK>in all seriousness  the warrior couldn t care any le about finishing a the first seed  a wa proven lat seaon   where they pretty much coated their way into the playoff  resulting in a second seed finish   they will find the right time and the right place to snap their finger and annihilate whoever is in front of them  the first seeded rocket can attest to that <BRK>judgment day for the nugget came a soon a the first quarter  where the warrior rained fire and brimstone upon their hapless opponent  by scoring   point  the warrior set a new franchise record for the most point scored in a single quarter  and it is also the nba record for the most point scored in a first quarter  they did not wate a single second dilly dallying  nor did they succumb to the trap of denver s high altitude environment  one that ha made victim out of a considerable amount of visiting team this seaon   the nugget      home record  a league best  is a testament to that <BRK>furthermore  the warrior were able to knock down   three in the first quarter  also a franchise record  it is a given that the warrior have their best game when they reach the double digit mark in made three  to reach it in the first quarter wa a portent of the misery the warrior were able to inflict on the nugget <BRK>let s dive into the offensive highlight of the warrior  historic first quarter <BRK>the warrior are their utmost peak when they are engaged on both end of the floor  offense may be their calling card  but defense is their pillar   it provides a strong foundation upon which they build the offensive momentum that ha run so many of their opponent out of the building <BRK>it is apropos  therefore  that the first point produced by the warrior are a result of excellent defense translating into instant offense <BRK>the nugget look to score their first point of the game by going to jamal murray  who ha kevin durant defending him  murray ha inside position against durant  and a pas to murray would allow him to easily score  but durant us his length to deflect the incoming pas  and the warrior force a turnover <BRK>on the other end  the nugget all too easily allow durant to walk up to the free throw line  where he go up for his patented mid range jumper   a shot that is impossible to stop due to durant being seven foot tall and having freakishly long arm <BRK>meanwhile  klay thompson get off to a good start by burying this step back three after after a fake put his defender up in the air  while thompson seemed to be regressing again   reverting back to a relatively mediocre shooting performance against the dallas maverick   this three wa a herald of his excellent performance that wa to come against the nugget <BRK>already the deadliest scorer alive  adding several dimension to his game ha made durant into a much better all around player  he ha made playmaking a point of emphais throughout the seaon  a evidenced by his average of     asists per game  a career high so far  he us his height to see above everyone else on the floor  a such  he see stephen curry on the weak side wing and whip the ball to him  a simple fake allows curry to go up for the uncontested three <BRK>after the warrior get an offensive rebound off of a missed free throw  they see thompson matched up against the much slower nikola jokić  thompson get jokić up in the air with a pump fake  which give him all the space he need to drive inside for the slam dunk   a rare sight for the splash brother who prefers to score mostly from the perimeter <BRK>durant dish out another assist from the low post  where he often get favorable matchup against smaller defender  the warrior do an excellent job of using off ball screening to get durant mismatch on the low post  where he receives the ball and ha several option open to him  <BRK>at the same time  thompson nudge his defender toward kevon looney s screen  break free  and receives the pas from durant for an open three  this action is very difficult for defense to stop  since they often have to pick their poison   a durant jumper down low  or a thompson three from the perimeter <BRK>the warrior specialize in immediately pushing the pace after giving up a basket  after jokić score  the warrior immediately take advantage of a lumbering nugget defense by pasing the ball just slightly ahead of durant  the nugget scramble to stop durant s parade toward the rim   but thompson ha stationed himself in the left corner  ready to receive durant s kick out pas  and the sequence end with the nugget wondering where they went wrong <BRK>durant s interaction with curry is already deadly with one of them handling the ball  but it is equally deadly during off ball screening action and interchange  with draymond green handling the ball  durant and curry come together  forcing the defender to be cognizant a to which course of action to take  curry s simple curl and dive inside allows  durant to pop out  and while the defender doe his best to stick to durant  that slight moment of hesitation allows durant to bury the three <BRK>curry s first three of the game take advantage of his knack for catching defender off guard with his off ball stop and go movement   watch murray in this sequence  who is guarding curry  looney encounter trouble inside  with murray thinking that the warrior  offense ha completely bogged down  but he loses track of curry  who suddenly zip toward the corner to provide pressure release for looney  with murray scrambling to keep up  curry knock down the wide open corner shot <BRK>durant s ability to score on his own is often taken for granted  due to how he make it look so easy  his uncanny ability to dribble like a guard is a huge aspect of his scoring prowess  in this sequence  a quick crossover allows him to blow past his defender  allowing him to put in a tough floater over jokić <BRK>due to steve kerr s philosophy of off ball movement and screening  the warrior rarely run the pick and roll  but when they do  it often involves curry  who is absolutely deadly both a a scorer and a a distributor in the pick and roll  after several off ball screen  looney go up to screen for curry  who drive inside and draw several defender onto him  this leaf looney wide open to roll toward the rim  and curry s exceptional bounce pas make it way to looney for an eay dunk <BRK>of course  an offensive explosion from the warrior wouldn t be complete without a deep pull up three from curry  in response to a corner three from the nugget  curry buries one from way beyond the arc and kill the excitement of the home crowd <BRK>a if to respond to his fellow superstar s three point shot  durant also go up for a three after the warrior get the offensive board  when both him and curry are on their absolute a game offensively  the fact that the other team is also playing well on that end is rendered moot <BRK>curry s highlight mostly consist of his otherworldly feat on offense  but in this possession  it s his defense that take center stage  he doe an excellent job of staying in front of his man  funneling him against the baseline and forcing an errant pas that he easily intercept  this lead into a fastbreak  where curry locates andre iguodala running ahead of everyone else <BRK>with the departure of javale mcgee and the scarce amount of playing time being given to jordan bell  the warrior find it difficult to run several of their play that take advantage of the presence of a vertical spacer  but in this sequence  that role is filled in by none other than the high flying alfonzo mckinney <BRK>green screen for durant off the ball  which ha the effect of drawing two defender onto durant  upon receiving the ball  durant immediately thread the pas on the short roll to green  who ha a two on one situation with mckinney  green throw a lob and mckinney go up for the athletic finish <BRK>durant continues his perfect scoring quarter with another example of using his length to negate excellent defense  receiving the ball in the corner  durant is funneled along the baseline and toward the tall and lengthy mason plumlee  plumlee us his long arm to contest durant s shot   which go in anyway  since durant himself is long and simply us that to counter plumlee s contest  it s a shot that is  quite simply  unstoppable <BRK>the warrior tie their franchise record of   three in a single quarter through another curry three  once again  durant is running thing from his lofty perch on the low post  with the option of calling his own number  or passing out to an open man on the perimeter  <BRK>the nugget send a triple team his way  however  so he is forced to pas out to green up top  meanwhile  curry sneakily relocates from the corner to the wing  with the defender falling for his fake shortly after receiving the ball  <BRK>not long after  the warrior break the franchise record  courtesy of a deep  curry esque pull up three from durant <BRK>with the quarter winding down  durant get ahead of his defender and receives the long inbound  he turn on the jet  cross over plumlee  and leaf behind a befuddled nugget defense for the emphatic slam dunk  which comprised their  st point of the first quarter <BRK>again    point in the first quarter alone <BRK>most team would consider scoring   point in a single quarter an incredible feat  the nugget were able to accomplish that against the warrior   and on some night  that would be enough to contribute to a victory against the defending champion <BRK>however  the warrior   who have plausibly denied that they take regular seaon game personally   performed like they did take this game personally  they have certainly heard whisper of their demise being scattered around the asociation  they have lost to contender who have been labeled a the usurper who will finally dethrone them from their status a the god of baketball  and they have shown sign of falling victim to internal strife and drama <BRK>they heard those whisper  and they responded with a bang  a   point first quarter  shooting   of   from the field    of   from three  and   assist to go with only   turnover <BRK>the nugget tried to be one of those usurper on tuesday night  eager to prove that they are deserving of the top spot in the western conference  but the warrior didn t waste any time in reminding them and the rest of the league that they can destroy anyone who stand in their way  through a thanosian snap of the finger <BRK>they did so without their fifth infinity stone  but that chapter is yet to come  and it will be a chapter that the rest of the league will have to brace themselves against <BRK>forty four down    more to go <BRK>stay golden  dub nation <BRK>
