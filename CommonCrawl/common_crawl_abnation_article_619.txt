lebron james ha a reputation a someone who get coach fired  which may or may not be fair  there s no real evidence that james wa directly involved in paul sila  firing by the cavalier in james  second seaon in the nba  mike brown wa hired by cleveland that summer  and didn t get let go until five year later  just week before james opted to leave the cavalier in free agency  it s hard to blame james for brown getting fired at that point  <BRK> solid report have swirled that james clumsily attempted to replace erik spoelstra and push pat riley to un retire from coaching in the trying early day in miami  but that never actually worked if it did happen  since spo still coach the heat  cleveland had already made a coaching change before james announced his return in    so he could not have been involved in the machination there   <BRK> there s no question james  open dislike for david blatt led to cleveland sacking him in the middle of the cavalier  championship   seaon  there s one notch  but ty lue  who had been hired a blatt s deputy before lebron arrived  wa promoted and lated until after james left lat summer  <BRK> sb nation stom ziller coined the term  lakers exceptionalism  several year ago  here is a history of him and other sb nation writer using that term over the year  <BRK> nov        jim bus and the myth of lakers exceptionalismjuly       melo to lakers rumor show how ridiculous lakers exceptionalism isjuly       lakers mystique is deadoct        jim bus wa right about one thing  lakers exceptionalism doesn t existjuly       lakers exceptionalism is deadjan        the lakers are still betting on their legacyfeb        time to believe in lakers exceptionalism againmarch       haha nevermindmarch       the lakers can t sell reality because fantasy is all they have <BRK> now  everyone expects the lakers to can luke walton at the end of this nightmare lakers seaon  with persistent report suggesting that he and james aren t really on the same page  fair or not  walton would see his name etched in stone under blatt a coach james got fired  what an honor  <BRK> but this open up a whole new world in james lore   <BRK> because james hasn t actually experienced too much coaching turnover in his career  there s never really been an opportunity for a coaching hire to be made specifically for james  you d have to go back to   to find an open coaching search made by a team with james under contract  and no one would argue that james had much  if any  pull in that initial mike brown hire in cleveland  <BRK> a such  this is going to a facinating experience   <BRK>    how forcefully will everyone involved   from jeannie bus to magic johnson to james himself   insist that james ha nothing to do with it  even though we all know that s grade a baloney   <BRK> it d be a breath of fresh air if everyone just acknowledged that james is the real power broker here and that the lakers will explicitly ask for his view  talk to rich paul and or read some tea leaf with his behavior   <BRK>    how much will james be involved  will this be a matter of explicitly asking his view  or  reading the tea leaf  will bus  reported discontent with team lebron s handling of l affair anthony davis matter  it s worth noting that late era kobe bryant did not apparently have pull in coaching decision  but that wa under the bizarre jim bus regime  also  james in   is way  way more important than kobe circa    <BRK>    given the weird timing of what come next  what s the priority here  the coaching decision will come before the draft  when a potential trade for davis or another star would likely happen  and free agency  is the priority a coach more reputed for developing young player  of which the lakers still have a bunch  and are in line to get another in the draft  or  will they prefer a personality manager who can balance james with a hoped for second superstar on the presumptive way via trade  a d   or free agency   <BRK> of course  coach aren t categorized so cleanly  but you can prioritize certain trait  there are both doc river  not available  and david fizdales  not available  we assume  out there   <BRK>    oh wow  mark jackson is definitely getting a look  isn t he  yeah  <BRK>

   <BRK>    how much of a draw  if any  is the opportunity to coach an aging james and potentially another superstar in los angeles with super high expectation  could the lakers convince a good coach in a good situation to risk it all for a chance at coaching james  doc ha said no  and you can come up with a reasonable list of other current nba head coach with security who would decline the opportunity given the lakers  oddly positioned front office and roster  there are probably   current head coach who say no  but that still leaf a few who d say yes   <BRK> this is to say nothing of the coach who are in broadcast or elsewhere right now  doe jeff van gundy more openly consider coming back to the sideline for this  probably not  given his stress on front office power and how poorly this magic rob pelinka thing ha gone  what about stan van gundy  he s probably a bad fit all the way around  we ve regrettably mentioned jackson  is doug collins walking through that door   <BRK>    is james going to push a james crony on the front office  doe anyone know if mike miller  james jones  or richard jefferson have coaching aspiration   how doe r jeff  noted friend of walton and james  feel about all this   <BRK>    is magic going to push a magic crony to the front of the line  is that derek fisher s music   <BRK>    is bus going to insist on keeping it in the laker family and push brian shaw  byron scott  the dreaded fisher  current lakers asistant mark madsen  or ty lue a contender  <BRK>    how will kobe bryant insert himself in this conversation  further  in the extremely unlikely event kobe himself becomes the head coach  will the lakers have wizenard alternate jersey  <BRK>    given all of the above  is it worth keeping walton and figuring it out   in almost all case where the question is whether it s worth keeping the incumbent around when said coach ha had a relatively short leash  the answer is yes   <BRK>    is this going to be a entertaining a we think it will be  because i have really  really high hope for this whole lakers summer  it ll be difficult to live up to lakers  seaon  but i have high  high hope  <BRK> nba news and link delivered to your inbox each weekday  so you never miss out  <BRK>
