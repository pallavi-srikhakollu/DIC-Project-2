a trade seaon ramp up  so do the rumor  to no one s surprise  the edmonton oiler are at the forefront of the rumor mill  the oiler  a team with the best player on the planet  find themselves struggling to stay at    and can t seem to pull themselves out of the baement in an already weak pacific division  on monday  tsn s edmonton reporter ryan rishaug stoked the coal of trade rumor with a taty tidbit on twitter <BRK>oiler organization is on a full court press to find help at forward  scout and staff deployed en masse  cap situation could make it tough  but first round pick  a goaltender  maybe a young developing forward likely all in play <BRK>the tweet wa of course met with a barrage of outlandish trade proposal  pipe dream  and twitter joke  but his tweet make sense   oiler management is no doubt feeling the pressure to fix it s leaky hull on an already busted vessel of an organization  and while i could deliver a lengthy anecdote about how the red wing should trade all of their bad player for edmonton s best player  i m taking the path of drawing sensible trade scenario between the two team  so  let s dig in <BRK>the red wing are assuming what could be a a yearslong rebuild   this after what seemed to be an interesting bounce back earlier this season that gave fan a sliver of hope to grasp onto  since then  it s been grim  the team ha won two of their last   game and are currently in a race with the ottawa senator in the atlantic division s  who can turn the most dreadful result derby   they re poised to be seller  and they have a list of player who could spark interest from the same general manager who traded one of the league s most electric winger for a depth defenseman  among other thing  here are my selling point to the oiler when they give ken holland a ring  keep in mind  a lot of these player have those ugly no trade clause in their contract  these scenario would assume the red wing can work with the player to make a deal passable   <BRK>nyquist is having a really good year for himself with being an unrestricted free agent this summer  he s on pace to have a career year  in fact  this is great news for the red wing  aside from that ugly ntc attached to his deal  nyquist would need to waive that part of his contract before the red wing can table him in an offer  so  assuming he doe  the team would be free to trade him wherever they please <BRK>i m of the opinion that the red wing can t go wrong with loading up with more draft pick  even if they re in the coming year  with nyquist s current production  he should easily land a first round selection  but with the oiler being where they are now  they ll have a pretty high pick  it s hard to see them ponying up a lottery pick for a rental winger  the oiler also have cap issue   so this can t be a straight up player for pick deal  detroit would need to eat salary and or unload an additional contract <BRK>my ideal transaction here would be gustav nyquist for oskar klefbom  with condition under the trade  if nyquist re sign  the trade is one for one  if he walk  the red wing would shell up a draft pick to compensate the oiler  outside of a  st rounder  and perhaps a high  nd  i d consider that  yes  i know this would make the logjam even log jammier  but with the team seeing some player come off the book in the year to come  i m fine with it <BRK>ah  another ntc  cool    but wait <BRK>this is a deal that would happen after the seaon is over  per capfriendly  the red wing can void darren helm s ntc starting june    if they don t make the playoff or if he doesn t register top   minute  toi   the former is the more realistic option  obviously  i think darren helm is a very useful player   a player that every single team in the nhl would love to have  a journeyman  a swiss army knife  a guy who can act a the  glue   if you will  it s unlikely that the red wing would want to move on from him  but they should consider it if edmonton were interested come june <BRK>no clause  no fuss  glendening  like helm  is another guy that every team is going to want  if he isn t traded to the toronto maple leaf  peter chiarelli would undoubtedly want his service  and at     mm for the next two season after this  it s an easily digestible trade <BRK>the caveat  of course  is that the red wing wouldn t think of trading him  i d reckon he retires a red wing <BRK>the oiler defense is a disaster  much like the red wing  fortunately  detroit ha a handful of up and comer in joe hicketts  vili saarijarvi  filip hronek  and more that could easily justify punting a veteran rearguard to another team  problem is  most of the veteran core ha is strapped with ntcs  and modified clause that come with no trade list  i can t imagine a single player who would look at edmonton and say  yeah  i need to go there   the cap situation also complicates thing <BRK>look  there are other team who will be interested in big name like gustav nyquist in the coming week  but it s been quiet on the red wing  front in term of willingness to sell  but the oiler are a very interesting candidate   they re not one that you need to strike a deal with this season  but perhaps one you can curate a future deal with <BRK> i digress  the aforementioned player  including others  should be in the conversation for trade bait  the red wing are going to need to be creative to ensure this rebuild  or whatever they want to call it  doesn t drag on like it ha in edmonton <BRK>
