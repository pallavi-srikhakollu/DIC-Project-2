hello  and welcome back to tactically naive  sb nation s weekly soccer column  this week s episode is brought to you by the international campaign to abolish timezones  stupid thing  get them gone <BRK>european football ha a dirty secret that hide in plain sight  the champion league may be the noisiest and the biggest competition  and the one with the most money and all of the gazprom  and the champion league is  generally  pretty great <BRK>but for the really good stuff  the purest uncut footballing nonsense  nothing but the europa league will do <BRK>tn ha covered most of the reasoning before  at some length  so we ll just summarize quickly  the name is better  thursday are much more convenient for everybody  it contains load of team you don t see all that often  and the trophy look like a tooth torn from some extra dimensional being  and  most importantly  sometimes the game are completely banana  <BRK>

  <BRK>consider sevilla s elimination at the hand of slavia prague  the first leg finished      the second leg finished      and then with one minute to go in extra time  the score wa      and sevilla were heading through on away goal  <BRK>then simon kjaer  usually a competent human being  fell over <BRK>well  that s not entirely fair  kjaer didn t just fall over  first he got himself in exactly the correct position to do exactly the right thing  a a goalmouth scramble unfolded  he got himself back onto the line  ready for the shot  ready to cover his goalkeeper  ready to be the hero  and then he fell over <BRK>more from andi thomas <BRK>choupo moting had one of the worst missed goal in history so that we could sin<BRK>ole gunnar solskj√¶r is manchester united s latest exercise in hope<BRK>zidane s return to real madrid may be even better than his departure<BRK>brendan rodgers may be what leicester city need  even if he isn t perfect<BRK>defender should stop kicking neymar just because he clowned them<BRK>well  that s not entirely right  he didn t just fall over  instead  he asked his body to make the clearance  and his body politely told him to do one  so he shivered  he stumbled  he danced  he ended up looking a little like bambi  if bambi wa wearing shoe three size too large  on the wrong foot  blindfolded  and drunk  playing qwop <BRK>funny in itself  of course  but tn ha a theory that these thing are funnier because they happen in the europa league  this strange second choice competition  this afterthought  this thursday night thing  <BRK>leaving aside the fan of the team involved  nobody quite know how important it is  and so nobody know how much they should be caring about it  the competition float in a limbo state  untethered from the grind  here  farce is at it lightest  a man falling over is just a man falling over  perfect and whole and isolated  and beautiful <BRK>alternative theory  kjaer s collapse is part of a broader pattern  strange thing are happening  like this <BRK>yep  this actually just happened at brunton park    cufc pic twitter com sptw fcmb <BRK>then it happened again <BRK>fuck my life  bwfcpic twitter com mx pfzh xw<BRK>and there wa also this <BRK>jesus  wbaswa pic twitter com nb svguhrb<BRK>and  best of all  this <BRK>astonishing own goal today in the  isthmianleague south central fixture between  bracknelltownfc and  officialtmufc  bracknell had just made it     through a   min penalty    minute later this happens   the robin go on to win       nonleague wind assisted          vid via btfc  pic twitter com hrm h vapo<BRK>should we be worried  one or two of these in a week might be eaily dismissed a just high spirit  but this feel like an unusually high concentration of silliness <BRK>it is a recurring theme across various culture  religion  and society  a the end time approach  the usual rule of existence break down  odd thing occur  bird fly backwards  the sea boil  and the sky seethe  weird trumpet sound come out of nowhere  which might explain the lat clip <BRK>perhaps it is finally happening  perhaps we ve finally reached a tipping point  the end of football  so much being played  all of it being broadcast  so many opinion being generated  so much attention  both demanded and given  so much time spent  glitch are starting to appear  the seam are starting to show  how are we supposed to keep on doing this  without something breaking  <BRK>oh  hang on   it s the international break next weekend  that ll sort it  phew <BRK>something funny is going on in england  there are four side in the fa cup semi final   that s normal  at least   and fully three of them would be interesting winner <BRK>the boring one is manchester city  who needed some good old fashioned governing body stupidity to get past swansea city  apparently  it s better not to install var in a var ready championship stadium because other championship stadium  at other time  haven t been able to use var <BRK>this baffling decision wa not reviewed  and city took full advantage  completing a three goal comeback with a soft penalty and an offside goal <BRK>but let s not focus on city  let s instead praise wolf  watford  and brighton   hove albion  who last won this competition in  respectively     never  and never  though oddly enough  brighton and watford lost consecutive final in   and   <BRK>let s particularly praise wolf  who took manchester united to piece in front of a delirious molineux  suddenly coming into a huge pile of money is one thing  using it correctly quite another  but wolf have done the decent thing  and built a side that are   if the glassy stare on the face of united s defender were anything to go by   more than a little terrifying <BRK>solid in defence  quick and imaginative on the break  and backed by a riotous crowd that are clearly having the time of their life  it s like wolf were built specifically for a cup run  to make big team look silly  and to drag just a little more magic out of the oldest silver pot of them all  it s going to be really annoying when watford bundle them out in the semi <BRK>
