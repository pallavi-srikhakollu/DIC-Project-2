thursday at     p m  et  and the tournament wrap up three week from now on monday  april    with the national championship game  <BRK> there will be plenty of cinderella story to keep u entertained  but even when cinderella come up jut short  she can still win you money against the spread  so  it s time to start figuring out where we ll see upset  <BRK> we ve listed out the spread for all   first round matchup for thursday s game  and then spoken with our network of team brand manager to figure out why each team might cover the spread  everybody ha their own philosophy  but getting insight from folk who are particularly dialed in can help get you a necessary edge to turn this march into a profitable one  <BRK> spread  michigan state      <BRK> why michigan state will cover  whether the line is at       or   point  michigan state will absolutely cover in their ncaa tournament opener against the bradley brave  there are actual baketball reaon  most important of which is bradley just isn t that good at baketball  the brave are averaging roughly   point per game  about the same a what msu allows on average  a good defense may be crucial to winning a championship for a contender  but a cinderella need to be able to score  michigan state  on the other hand  can put up point on almost any defense  and force other team to play at their speed  a fifth place mvc team  no matter their conference tournament success  isn t going to keep up  there are issue with bradley off the court a well  unlike most upset minded team  bradley doesn t have the support of the small school loving medium  after an embarrasing weekend of banning  then unbanning a hometown journalist for  not supporting the brand   bradley s player have had to deal with a whole different kind of medium blitz this week  forget   point  get better odds and take msu at      kyle thele  the only color <BRK> why bradley will cover  bradley is  st in adjusted tempo  per kenpom  and  th  out of   team  in adjusted defensive possession length  in other word  the brave are likely to slow the game down  meaning michigan state must be highly efficient on offense to blow it open    chris dobbertean  blogging the bracket <BRK> spread  lsu    <BRK> why lsu will cover  the most obvious reaon to think lsu cover the      spread against yale is seeding  lsu s a three seed for a reaon  and yale  despite being ivy league champion  is still a mid major school and the rationale is that lsu ha the better talent  but that s too simplistic and frankly the wrong way at looking at yale  yale is a quality a team a it get and the roster is full of experienced player  yale like to push the pace  but that s a weapon lsu can turn against the bulldog  a quicker tempo also lends more chance to create turnover and lsu is eighth in the entire country in steal thanks in large part to guard tremont water and skylar may  yale rank  th nationally in turnover so lsu is begging the bulldog to play uptempo  the tiger also have a significant size advantage in the front court with naz reid  kavell bigby williams and emmitt williams  lsu is the second best offensive rebounding team in the country for a reaon and it s largely owed to that trio s length  between the ample opportunity for point off of turnover and getting high percentage look in the painted area  lsu should be able to get to the second round and cover the spread in the process    zachary junda  and the valley shook <BRK> why yale will cover  internal turmoil ha made lsu hard to peg and that s part of the reason why yale is a trendy upset pick  it also help that the bulldog have a legit nba prospect in miye oni  yale doen t do any one thing spectacularly  but it doe everything well  if oni get going from three  they will be tough to stop    russell steinberg  mid major madness <BRK> spread  maryland      <BRK> why maryland will cover  maryland limped to the finish in the big ten  but the terps have big men worth betting on  sophomore center bruno fernando earned first team all big ten honor after averaging a double double for the seaon  and only a few team on maryland s schedule all year have been able to contain him  he s coming off a seaon low three point in the conference tournament  but ha a staggering   double double in   game  fernando and jalen smith are a formidable a front line a any in the country  and the terps have enough playmaker in the backcourt to make life difficult for anyone    thoma kendziora  testudo time <BRK> why belmont will cover  belmont will be coming into thursday s game fresh off a tuesday win over temple which didn t see them play at their best  this is particularly true for the bruin  best player  nba draft prospect dylan windler  who scored just five point on a poor shooting night   a   percent three point shooter  he wa just   of   from beyond the arc in dayton   at large first four winner historically do well in their first round game in the main draw  and the bruin offense and quick tempo  which can bother a maryland team used to playing in a slower big ten  should enable them to at least keep this matchup to a one possession game late    chris dobbertean  blogging the bracket <BRK> spread  louisville      <BRK> why louisville will cover  minnesota is one of the worst shooting team in the tournament  and  a a result  a lot of the time when they lose  they lose bad  seven of the gopher   loss this seaon have come by double digit  and two of the game that were single digit defeat came by nine point  louisville ha been an erratic offensive team at time this seaon  but they ve been solid in march so far  the cardinal  adjusted offensive efficiency rating of     for the month to date is the  rd best in the country    mike rutherford  card chronicle  <BRK> why minnesota will cover  minnesota s ability to draw foul keep them in most game  the golden gopher got to the foul line on   percent of their field goal attempt this seaon  a top   mark in the country  jordan murphy is a dependable inside scorer who control the glas and amir coffey is a big wing who can slah to the rim  a long a minnesota doesn t dig itself into a big hole  they can cover     point    ricky o donnell <BRK> spread  purdue    <BRK> why purdue will cover  purdue ha one of the most efficient offense in the nation even when carsen edward ha not been  matt haarms ha been playing great baketball down the stretch while ryan cline ha been hot from three all seaon  when everything is clicking purdue is a very dangerous team with haarms able to play inside and out while running the high ball screen  edward ha also been better in neutral site game a opposed to true road game  a evidenced by the below from our writer juan crespo    travis miller  hammer and rail <BRK> i decided to take a look at carsen s number over the season  and divided it up by home v away v neutral  i also redid his away number by taking away his number from texas game  an outlier at this point  not great  pic twitter com oiqgpvjnmc <BRK> why old dominion will cover  old dominion is another slow team   th in adjusted tempo  that is strong defensively   th in adjusted defensive efficiency   but the monarch have also gotten themselves in the habit of playing very close game  of their   game so far  just   were decided by   or more point  with just five of those contest coming since january    chris dobbertean  blogging the bracket <BRK> spread  villanova    <BRK> why villanova will cover  villanova ha had a relatively down year this year  but they are entering the tournament fresh off of a big east tournament championship  their third straight  in st  mary s  villanova face a team very similar to their own  one who play at a molasses pace  villanova and st  mary s are  th and  th in offensive tempo  respectively   ha a relatively thin rotation   th and  th in bench minute   and whose offense are built around the three  villanova is third in  p fga  st  mary s is  rd in  p    the crucial difference  villanova is playing     mile closer to home than st  mary s   nova ha the better coach  and the wildcat are the better team by most advanced metric  villanova may have a tough matchup against the gael  but scottie reynolds will be avenged and jay wright s quad will be able to win by more than five come thursday night    mike jacob  vu hoop <BRK> why st  mary s will cover  by the kenpom and net ranking  the saint mary s villanova game is among the closest in the entire first round  closer than many   v    and   v    game  and in many way  these team are mirror image of one another  however  the gael shoot a little better from outside and if their three drop  this one will be tight to the end    chris dobbertean  blogging the bracket <BRK> spread  kentucky    <BRK> why kentucky will cover  kentucky is coming off a gut wrenching loss to tennessee in the sec tournament  which not only cost the wildcat a no    seed  but also kept them from playing in louisville for the south region  they ll be ready to take out their anger on whoever is up next  which happens to be abilene christian  who simply hasn t beaten anyone of consequence   <BRK> according to kenpom  acu s best win is over  th ranked campbell  who is also ranked  rd in the ncaa s net ranking  acu is  th   the only legitimate foe acu faced wa texas tech  who won     in lubbock  jacksonville is a bit of a travel for kentucky fan  but they ve typically painted florida blue whenever the cat play in the sunshine state  so it should be a semi home game for them   <BRK> this is a game kentucky should absolutely win by   point or more  so i feel good about the lexington cat covering the spread v  the abilene cat    jason marcum  a sea of blue <BRK> why abilene christian will cover  abilene christian force turnover  particularly steal  and shoot three pointer at a good clip  if the southland champ deploy those two weapon successfully  they should keep this one within   point    chris dobbertean  blogging the bracket <BRK> spread  kansa      <BRK> why kansa will cover  at first glance  northeastern look like a team that could slay mighty kansa  they take over   percent of their shot from behind the arc  and they are a top   team in term of three point percentage  however  northeastern is a sub   team in several key defensive measure  and they don t have anyone who can match up with ku s bigs  especially dedric lawson  additionally  the husky haven t seen anyone with devon dotson s quickness on the perimeter  it will be a tough order for them to stay in front of ku s point guard defensively   kansa should be able to score at will  and bill self ha plenty of time to figure out how to get his defense to stay in front of northeastern s shooter  also keep in mind that northeastern struggled to score against their p  opponent this year  alabama  virginia tech  syracuse   even though they went     in those game  their highest point output wa just    and that wa the win over alabama  an nit team  it may be a popular upset pick in some circle  but look for the jayhawks to cover relatively comfortably    mike plank  rock chalk talk <BRK> why northeastern will cover  northeastern ha five player who make their three point attempt at better than a   percent clip  if at least three of them get hot  the husky will at least keep it close    chris dobbertean  blogging the bracket <BRK> spread  auburn      <BRK> why auburn will cover  auburn is one of the best team in the country at converting turnover into point  new mexico state run a slow paced offense  but will have to contend with auburn s press  which will try to force the aggies to get out of their half court set  it worked against tennessee in the sec championship  and auburn will cover because they will have way more possession than the aggies want them to have  <BRK> oh  and jared effing harper    jack condon  college and magnolia <BRK> why new mexico state will cover  new mexico state is one of the deeper team in the country  a head coach chris jan ha a rotation that feature   player who play at leat   minute per game  that mean the aggies will be able to rotate their player in and out enough to contend with the tiger  pace and tempo    chris dobbertean  blogging the bracket <BRK> spread  wofford    <BRK> why wofford will cover  in a game that should be a delight for fan who like to see player hit big shot  wofford ha plenty of guy who can shoot the three  not only do the terrier have fletcher magee      percent from beyond the arc   they have storm murphy      percent   nathan hoover      percent   tray hollowell      percent   and cameron johnson      percent  roaming the perimeter  that s a lot of scoring power for seton hall to contend with    chris dobbertean  blogging the bracket <BRK> why seton hall will cover  myles powell is one of the most electric scorer in the entire tournament  having recorded      point game this seaon  between powell s gift on offense and the recent emergence of guard myles cale a a secondary scorer and three point threat  the pirate should be in good shape against a wofford defense that struggled against high major opponent in conference play    robert o neill  big eat coat bia <BRK> spread  gonzaga      <BRK> why gonzaga will cover  the gonzaga bulldog will eaily beat the spread against the fairleigh dickinson knight for one simple reaon  gonzaga beat it conference opponent this year by an average of   point per game  the knight are ranked no    by kenpom  which would put them a the third worst team in the wcc  gonzaga s offense is too good to stop  and mark few will be looking for a statement from his squad after that abysmal loss to saint mary s in the wcc tournament championship game    peter woodburn  the slipper still fit <BRK> why fairleigh dickinson will cover  while gonzaga ha been a no    seed twice  their two first round win both came by le than the spread for thursday s contest  in    the bulldog only defeated southern by six  while in    they took down south dakota state by    with fairleigh dickinson being an excellent perimeter shooting team  the knight can definitely use the three ball to ensure history repeat itself    chris dobbertean  blogging the bracket <BRK> spread  michigan    <BRK> why michigan will cover  michigan and montana faced off last year in the ncaa tournament first round under similar circumstance and the wolverine only beat them by    that team wa a bit better than this edition of the wolverine  but with the spread set at     for thursday s game  i feel like they should be able to cover that coming off of another disappointing loss to michigan state and knowing what s on the line now  we saw a much more motivated and ready for march basketball team last weekend in chicago  and i think they know what they have to do  they ll cover it    anthony broome  maize n brew <BRK> why montana will cover  montana brings one of the most experienced roster to the ncaa tournament  and actually lost to michigan in the tournament lat year a a   seed  the griz get good look on offense almost every time down  and actually rank  th in the country in effective field goal percentage  the game will probably be played at a slower tempo  and the griz can cover if they execute their offense    russell steinberg  mid major madness <BRK> spread  florida state    <BRK> why florida state will cover  florida state s defense is rated ninth nationally  but since feb    they been playing at an elite level  third nationally   their length will give vermont fit and allow fsu to score enough in transition to keep their opponent at bay    michael rogner  tomahawk nation <BRK> why vermont will cover  the best player on the floor won t be in garnet and gold  anthony lamb can bully most everyone on fsu s team who will be guarding him  and when he can t  he ll knock down three or go to his midrange game  the seminole can t match up    michael rogner  tomahawk nation <BRK> spread  marquette    <BRK> why marquette will cover  first  marquette is the best defensive team that murray state ha seen all season  marquette is no    in kenpom s adjusted defensive efficiency metric  and murray state han t even played against a top   defense since the calendar changed to    second  if marquette ha a lead late and need to hold onto the margin from the free throw line  they can rely on being a top   free throw shooting team with three starter shooting over   percent from the charity stripe  finally  and it s the easiest and most obvious answer  marquette ha markus howard and murray state doe not  oh  don t get me wrong  ja morant is great  and doe stuff howard cannot  but howard is a much more explosive scorer  capable of single handedly turning a game from a possession or two into a   point margin in mere minute  and you d only need one hand to count the number of shot that it took him to do it    andrew fleck  anonymous eagle <BRK> why murray state will cover  you know exactly why murray state can cover  they have ja morant  whose matchup with markus howard is going to be appointment viewing  the     is always a popular upset pick  and murray state is going to follow that trend  it shouldn t be remotely surprising if they cover and even win outright  ja and the racer are that good    russell steinberg  mid major madness  <BRK> spread  nevada      <BRK> why nevada will cover  nevada ha ton of experience  both in the age of player  the oldest team in the tournament  and postseason experience  after a run to the sweet   last year   the martin twin   caleb and cody   are the most well known on the team  but jordan caroline may be one of the most underrated player in the country  he sat out the mwc title game with an achilles issue  but he should be back for this one against the gator  the wolfpack don t turn it over and run an efficient offense  they can get bucket  and don t ever count them out  see  comeback v  cincy last year     caroline darney <BRK> why florida will cover  the gator rank  th in adjusted defense and rank near the bottom of the nation in adjusted tempo  nevada ha a notably deeper offense  and florida and will look to slow this game down by a considerable margin  nevada brings an edge in experience  but if florida turn this into an ugly slog  they can spring the upset    david fucillo <BRK> spread  syracuse    <BRK> why syracuse will cover  baylor is one of the best offensive rebounding team in the country  but syracuse should be able to weather that storm and cover a the tallest team in the country  the orange received some inspired guard play in the acc tournament without tyus battle and are now playing at it highest level all seaon  with battle back in the fold  look for syracuse to lock in defensively in the     zone a it often doe in march and cover the point spread    james szuba  troy nunes is an absolute magician <BRK> why baylor will cover  baylor will cover because baylor ha a massive offensive rebounding advantage   the bear are second in offensive rebounding rate  and syracuse is  th in defensive rebounding rate  explored more here   the orange let north carolina  a worse offensive rebounding team  grab   percent of their miss  baylor run that back and move on    kendall kaut  our daily bear <BRK>
