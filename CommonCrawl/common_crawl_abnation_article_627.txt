colin kaepernick s nearly two year collusion case against the nfl and it team owner is over  at least formally  on friday  kaepernick and former  er teammate eric reid agreed to a settlement with the league <BRK>the agreement wa a conclusion that worked for both side  the nfl paid to keep the league s inner working under wrap  avoiding any potential admission of guilt for a price the league could live with   though not a small amount  insider pegged the payment  which is undisclosed under the settlement s confidentiality agreement  to kaepernick alone at between    and    million <BRK>reid and kaepernick were granted more than restitution  even if collusion wa neither proven nor disproven  they at least earned a sliver of validation that their complaint   that the league wa working against them to prevent their employment due to their political view and demonstration during the national anthem   held merit <BRK>the settlement close a tumultuous chapter in kaepernick s career and allows him to move on with his life  the question now is  what happens to the nfl s most visible activist  with his collusion complaint against the league settled and reid firmly entrenched with the panther  where doe the veteran quarterback go from here <BRK>the former  er quarterback is no longer embroiled in a legal battle with the nfl  theoretically  that make him easier for team to justify signing  kaepernick s attorney  mark geragos  told cnn that kaepernick  absolutely want to play  and even said he believed that one of three team   including the panther or patriot   would bring him in  <BRK>yet  it s still difficult to see any team jumping at the opportunity  <BRK>kaepernick wa a capable starting quarterback for san francisco a a low risk dual threat paser who helped engineer the team s super bowl appearance during the   seaon  while he shared snap with blaine gabbert and went     a a starter for a rebuilding     team in    he also recorded a     touchdown to interception ratio and a     paser rating   the latter strong enough to rank  th in the league <BRK>but even a gabbert went on to another job and quarterback like nathan peterman and trevor siemian would earn opportunity to start for nfl team  kaepernick han t played a snap since new year s day    he ha had no offer  despite his performance in his lat seaon behind center proving he still ha what it take to play in the nfl <BRK>his decision to kneel during the national anthem made him a divisive figure almost immediately  beginning in the preseaon of    kaepernick either sat on the bench or kneeled during  the star spangled banner  before each game  a a way to protest the oppression of people of color in the united state and ongoing issue with police brutality <BRK> i m going to continue to stand with the people that are being oppressed   kaepernick said that august   to me  this is something that ha to change  when there s significant change and i feel that flag represents what it s supposed to represent  and this country is representing people the way that it s supposed to  i ll stand  <BRK>his action soon became a powder keg of debate  president donald trump lobbed personal attack at kaepernick throughout his presidential campaign and into his presidency  the nfl enacted  then rescinded  a policy revolving around player conduct during the anthem last year  and while the conflict over whether player should be forced to stand ha died down to ember  kaepernick s return would almost certainly fan those flame back to life <BRK>nike s choice to feature him a the face of a new advertising campaign furthered the divide between his supporter and detractor and led to a handful of entirely unsuccessful boycott of the brand s product  <BRK>we saw what even the mention of his name is capable of creating in kaepernick s home state this very month  lawmaker in wisconsin rejected a resolution recognizing black history month because the   year old quarterback wa listed among the honored african american with local root  the legislation  typically a formality in state level politics  wa only approved after kaepernick had been removed <BRK>that mean any team signing kaepernick would put itself in the middle of a medium firestorm shared million and million of time over on social medium  if none of these team were willing to trade their facebook like for a quarterback upgrade in   or   with the threat of collusion staring them in the face  it s unlikely that will change now the case is settled <BRK>although kaepernick would be one of the more talented available free agent  there s no glut of veteran quarterback available to fill roster spot this spring  several paser are slated for free agency  including tyrod taylor  nick foles  and teddy bridgewater  more could be releaed a the draft approach  like cae keenum  eli manning  ryan tannehill  and blake bortles  <BRK>there are also several soon to be rookie quarterback who are projected a first round pick in the   nfl draft  such a ohio state stud dwayne hakins and reigning heisman trophy winner kyler murray  this is a buyer s market for quarterback help  and team across the league can find a player capable of giving them   percent of kaepernick s production  or better  while earning them   percent of the controversy  deserved or not <BRK>kaepernick  at his best  would be one of the top option of that group  he ha reportedly remained in game shape during his hiatus <BRK> i ve been training  kaepernick  everyday and to say he s dedicated is an understatement  each day we hit the gym and put in work  we haven t stopped throwing  training and preparing since january of    even when we re traveling we put in that work  nevertired     imwithkap<BRK>a post shared by  josh hidalgo  cscs   hidalgoj   on mar      at    pm pdt<BRK>however  it s impossible to simulate the sunday experience in workout  and his two year away from the game would be a concern  he reportedly turned down an offer to play in the alliance of american football  which may have more to do with a league where his competition consists of christian hackenberg than anything else  tim tebow also  reportedly  turned down an offer from the fledgling league   a top   nfl quarterback shouldn t have to resort to the aaf at age     especially not when   year old josh johnson  who hadn t thrown a pas in the regular season since    wa signed by wahington this past december <BRK>in addition  the league s ability to accommodate mobile quarterback like lamar jackson and josh allen suggests there would be a place for kaepernick if team weren t scared off by his activism and any backlash that followed <BRK>while there wa no official ruling and the curtain wan t pulled back on the league s owner  the settlement is a win for kaepernick  a confidentiality agreement will protect the nfl  but a potential nine figure settlement strongly suggests the former  er pair had a case  this wa a costly lesson for the league  and it should lead to change   even if that change doesn t come with a public declaration  <BRK>player like reid  albert wilson  and kenny still can feel more comfortable in their choice to kneel or raise a fist to bring awareness to issue of injustice  teammate can join them  a little more secure in the idea they won t waste year of their money making prime in limbo while owner decide whether or not they can sign a player who might speak out  now commissioner roger goodell and the owner know they can t feign ignorance in a similar situation   and that s a good thing for player and the nfl <BRK>but kaepernick may never play another down in the nfl  an unfair outcome and one he always knew wa possible <BRK> if they take football away  my endorsement from me  i know that i stood up for what is right   kaepernick said back in   before his demonstration became the argument everyone and no one wa willing to have <BRK>kaepernick s action brought attention to the cause he championed  from fighting hunger to founding know your right camp  he s been prolific with his charitable donation throughout his career  he spent most of   donating    million to different cause  and that fails to cover the extent of his work helping others and the impact he s had <BRK>furthering kaepernick s legacy is that he opened up a dialogue that prompted the nfl to pursue social justice initiative aimed at strengthening community  and eventually led to million pledged to equality effort <BRK>at this year s super bowl  his social justice effort were prominent all week  even at league sanctioned event <BRK>his message went beyond two rarely broadcasted minute before each game and made him a modern symbol of resistance  in that  he did something greater than football <BRK>
