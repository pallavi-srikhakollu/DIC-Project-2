brooklyn   the saint louis billikens play a seven man rotation  in brooklyn at the atlantic   tournament  they had to play four game in four day  yet late in the conference championship game against st  bonaventure  it wa the bonnies who were gassed  and saint louis wa in position to put them away  <BRK> billikens coach travis ford say he take note of how opponent enter a huddle during timeouts  a st  bonaventure entered the under eight minute medium timeout  ford saw a team that wa spent  his team had whittled what wa a   point bonnies lead down to two  and he told his team in the timeout that they had to make their move right then  that move wa to  a he put it   put the pedal to the metal   <BRK>  you don t worry about being fatigued when you re laser focused and you re focused on doing your job   ford said after the championship game  a     billikens win   i don t think these guy had time to think  i think they had more to prove   <BRK> yes  saint louis is well conditioned  so are a lot of team  that wasn t going to be enough in the conference tournament and it s not going to be enough if the billikens hope to knock off virginia tech in the first round of the ncaa tournament  <BRK> if saint louis is going to make a run in march  it will be because of it coach s intuition and it player  resolve  <BRK> that s been the case all season  <BRK> saint louis entered     a preseaon atlantic   favorite  it wa supposed to blend the experience of guy like senior javon be and tramaine isabell with the raw talent of freshman carte are gordon  <BRK> just three day before practice started  junior transfer luis santos wa suspended indefinitely for a violation of team rule  he later withdrew from the university  saint louis also lost ingvi gudundsson  brother of a   player of the year jon axel gudmundsson  then it wa the prized recruit and backboard shatterer gordon  on top of all of that  dion wiley missed time in december with an injury  <BRK>  guy could have quit   isabell said  thinking back to the rough time   i mean  some locker room might   <BRK> and then the conference season started and  even though the billikens were down to essentially a seven man rotation  all seemed right again  saint louis raced out to a     league record  complete with a win over saint joseph s  who wa picked to finish second  <BRK> that s when the losing started  it wa four in row  with three of them coming by four point or fewer   <BRK> from then on  there wa never really a point where saint louis finally seemed to put it together  there wa an impressive win over dayton  but that wa followed up with a   point drubbing to saint joe s  then back to back close loss at the flyer and at vcu  followed with two huge home win over george mason and duquesne  three day later  the billikens closed the regular season with a loss to st  bonaventure  ending their hope for a double bye in the conference tournament  <BRK> be s production waxed and waned throughout the year a he led his team in minute despite being restricted by an ankle injury  not coincidentally  be failed to surpas   point in five conference game this year  and saint louis lost four of them  going into brooklyn  he wa shooting just   percent from the field in his lat six game  he d need to play   plus minute  four day in a row  and if he wan t going to be effective  then isabell  who seemed to raise his game when his team needed it most  would have to be other worldly  <BRK> no one could have been blamed for counting out the tournament s six seed  it wa a lost season  partly due to factor out of their control  but lost nonetheless  <BRK> their first round win over richmond wa hardly notable and their quarterfinal win over dayton wa surprising  but appeared to just be a weird championship week blip  in the semi  they went into halftime tied with two seed davidson in an ugly game  and it felt like it would all catch up with the billikens  there wa no way they could gut out one more half of basketball against a rested wildcat team that had arguably the two best player in the conference  <BRK> instead  saint louis came out of the halftime locker room and blew the door off davidson  outscoring them     in the second half to cruise into the title game  <BRK> sunday against st  bonaventure seemed like another logical time for the billikens  leg to give out  <BRK>  i wa just hoping we had enough in our tank   ford said after the game   we re going to have to dig  dig deep  and these guy are amazing  they dug deep  they found something and just said  we re going to refuse to give into this    <BRK> if there wa fatigue in the second half of a tight championship game  the player didn t feel it  <BRK>  nobody wa fatigued because adrenaline just kept you up  and not wanting to let your teammate down   jordan goodwin said  he finished the title game with   point and   rebound  <BRK> hasahn french admitted that he felt a little fatigued  but he saw the finish line so close that it didn t matter  <BRK>  i had to suck it up   he said   it s the championship   <BRK> the story of a team overcoming adversity and gutting out a championship is nothing new  but the inspirational narrative doesn t happen at all without some equally important  if not le sexy  tactical adjustment  <BRK> ford ha had his struggle a a coach  most notably at oklahoma state where he wa fired in   after a     seaon  but he s been around  and he went into brooklyn with a plan to get the most out of the seven guy who would see the floor  <BRK> saint louis is   and this may be putting it nicely   a bad offensive team  the billikens ranked  th in the country in three point percentage   nd in free throw percentage  and  th in offensive efficiency  according to kenpom   <BRK> they win game on defense  and so it may have seemed odd for ford to start changing thing up on that end right a the postseaon began  he resorted to leaning on a       zone could not only throw opponent off  but give player a chance to steal a quick breather  <BRK>  if we re going to win four game  we had to figure out five to six minute in the game where we could conserve a little bit of energy  and then try to keep team off balance a little bit   <BRK> the plan worked to perfection against davidson  the wildcat took   three in the game  but made just seven of them  <BRK> that scheme wa far le successful early on against st  bonaventure a the bonnies built a double digit lead in the first half  so ford switched to a man to man  risking his player  endurance because he just didn t have a better option  and while the bonnies led by nine at the half  ford decided to stick with it  with one minor adjustment  in the second half  when saint louis started denying bonnies star courtney stockard the middle of the floor  forcing him to the sideline  their offense seemed thrown off  st  bonaventure started taking worse shot  later in the shot clock  it gave saint louis confidence  fed that adrenaline  and forced st  bonaventure to work even harder  <BRK> so when the under eight medium timeout hit  one team wa rested  and it wa the group of seven guy who were playing their fourth game in four day  <BRK>  these guy   ford said   they have a competitive nature about them that s fun to watch and fun to coach   <BRK> next up  it s virginia tech on friday  saint louis is a trendy upset pick  and with nearly a week to get ready  it make sense  the preseason a   favorite seem to have put it together  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
