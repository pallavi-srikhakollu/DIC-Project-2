rob gronkowski only had one catch for   yard last sunday  he wa still instrumental to the patriot  crushing divisional round playoff win over the los angeles charger  <BRK> gronkowski wa only targeted once in tom brady s   pass  but he still helped propel his team to   point and an eighth straight appearance in the afc title game  the   pound tight end devastated the charger  linebacker light lineup with the other five star tool he brings to the field   a space clearing blocking game  <BRK> gronkowski and fullback james develin barely showed up in the box score last week  three combined touch   but the patriot  beeftrain lineup  tm  made the duo the unofficial sixth and seventh member of the club s offensive line  when head coach bill belichick opted to shift his focus away from los angeles  defensive back heavy scheme  he opted instead for a series of run and screen pass that allowed new england to wear down it visitor early and often  <BRK> the plan worked to perfection  the patriot  typically a pas first team thanks to brady s never ending reign in the pocket  ran for   yard and four touchdown     in the first half alone  the charger never had a chance after that  <BRK> the biggest beneficiary of gronkowski s blocking wa rookie tailback sony michel  who ha used the bulk of   to prove he wa worthy of a first round selection last spring  michel s ability to exploit the hole created up front pushed him to his fifth    yard performance of the year  <BRK> but michel s run didn t just create first down  they outright demoralized la  thanks to the lane clearing blocking up front that kept defender from even getting a hand on him until he wa several yard downfield  his   yard scamper in the second quarter summed up new england s dominance perfectly  <BRK> sony michel running wild today    flyguy stackz pic twitter com zindngos n <BRK> here  develin and gronkowski seal off the edge  creating the off tackle seam that michel slide through  easily shrugging off a diving arm tackle en route to a   yard gain   the longest of his nfl career  the skycam view of the play show only one defender on the right side of the field even breach the line of scrimmage  and safety jahleel addae s quest to get around the edge to stop michel is quickly snuffed out by develin  <BRK> here  the pair team up again to ensure no static on the left side of the line for michel s first touchdown of the afternoon  <BRK> and here he negates inside linebacker hayes pullard   while doing enough borderline holding to help his team without drawing a flag in the process   to help clear the path that allowed michel to go untouched for the first   yard of a   yard touchdown run soon after gronk is very strong  but he s also smart about knowing when to let go of a linebacker s jersey before the umpire take notice  <BRK> by putting gronkowski in motion  the patriot were able to add an extra blocker a they attacked the la defense with off tackle carry  but since the all pro tight end is also an explosive receiver out of those set  his movement alone wan t enough to tip new england s hand  instead  it all played into a larger strategy  <BRK> los angeles  success against the raven in the wild card round wa predicated on a powerful push from the line of scrimmage and the blanketing coverage from a secondary that typically relied on five or six defensive back to take away baltimore s limited receiving corp  that s a plan that could have worked on the patriot  too  new england s offensive line is stronger than the raven   but the team s lack of high level receiver meant a decent push up front would give la the latitude to snuff out gronkowski and leading receiver julian edelman with never ending double coverage  <BRK> this did not happen   <BRK> instead  offensive coordinator josh mcdaniels took advantage of the charger  lack of bulk up front by beginning the game with a litany of run and short pass  these play were designed to compress the los angeles secondary pre snap and spread it defensive line from sideline to sideline after it  the patriot used gronkowski s blocking to open hole in the run game  but also sent him up the seam to draw two defender downfield  creating the space for james white to thrive behind brady s screen pass  <BRK> this setup created the space for brady to throw for   yard on an afternoon where   of his team s first   play were either run or short pas  his first play action pas of the day resulted in a   yard gain  he didn t even need to fake a handoff to record his only touchdown of the game against a disheveled charger secondary  <BRK>        find        in the corner of the end zone   lacvsne    everythingwegot pic twitter com blmu to g <BRK> no team in the league gave up more yard per carry than kansa city s      in the divisional round  the chief allowed the colt to run for   yard on   carry   though the bulk of those came after that game wa well in hand   <BRK> when these team last met  the patriot dominated the time of possession battle by more than   minute thanks to a   yard  two touchdown performance from michel  who wa making just the third start of his career  that didn t stop kansa city from maintaining a typically prodigious pace on offense  but new england s ability to burn clock late on the ground and with short pass wa the key in it     win   <BRK> three run and a short screen pas to james white worked the clock from     to   second at the end of a tied game  it also softened up the chief  defense to spring gronkowski for a   yard catch that set up stephen gostkowski s game winning   yard field goal second later   <BRK> so while gronkowski may not be in the midst of a dominant seaon a a receiver  he s still a masive part of the patriot  upset hope at arrowhead stadium sunday  new england can win if he make eight catch in the afc title game  but sunday s win over the charger show the pat can win if he doesn t get a single target  too  <BRK>
