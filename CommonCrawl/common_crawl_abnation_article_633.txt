the eastern conference playoff race ha become an increasingly tight race over the past couple of week and your pittsburgh penguin are one of the team sitting on the bubble at the bottom of the playoff picture  <BRK>thing started to look a little bleak on sunday afternoon having entered the day on the outside of the playoff picture  the latest they have been in such a position since the     season  with a chance to move back into a spot with a win over a rebuilding new york ranger team  they allowed a two goal lead to slip away and then found themselves facing a four minute penalty kill entering the third period  <BRK>it is not that a loss in that position would have been a season crusher or wrecked their playoff chance  but it would have been a brutal way to give up two important point in the standing  <BRK>instead of letting it totally slip away  the penguin responded with what might have been the most important five minute of their season to this point by perfectly killing off the double minor penalty  and then just one minute later regaining the lead on a highlight reel connection between sidney crosby and kris letang <BRK>evgeni malkin followed that up by scoring two more goal over the next five minute to give the penguin all of the necessary insurance they would need <BRK>and it is very fitting that his ridiculous backhand goal ended up going in the book a the game winner  because that goal need to be remembered in all of it brilliance for being the huge goal that it wa <BRK>there are a couple of positive development to take away from sunday s game  and some are going to end up being more important than others <BRK>first  the penguin responded when they needed to  <BRK>too many time this seaon we ve seen them lose game like sunday and leave valuable point on the table  it s a big reaon they have one of the best goal differential in the conference and are currently clinging to a playoff spot by the slimmest of margin  whether or not that win serf a some kind of a jumping off point from here remains to be seen  i m skeptical about how much momentum carry over to the next game in situation like this because it s a fresh start with a new opponent and everyone in a new mindset  <BRK>it still can not hurt to win a game the way they did given all of the circumstance within the game itself and the bigger picture in the standing  <BRK>they needed two point  it felt like two point were on the verge of slipping away  and they were able to rise to the occasion and secure the two point  all good <BRK>the most important development  however  wa the return of the dominant version evgeni malkin <BRK>a i ve written over the pat week or so here  we can talk about his  down  seaon and how weirdly frustrating it ha been all we want  the fact remains that he is an elite  superstar talent and even in a down year is still one of the most productive player in the world and still somebody that can make a difference in the lineup  you notice him when he is not there  <BRK>over his past few game  we have also started to really notice him when he is there  <BRK>his game against tampa bay and philadelphia were probably two of his better performance since the first two week of the season     right up until he got himself injured against tampa bay in a fight with steven stamkos  sidelining him for five game  and then earning a one game suspension for swinging his stick at michael raffl in philadelphia <BRK>he wa showing sign of being evgeni malkin <BRK>the evgeni malkin the penguin need to make a run at the stanley cup <BRK>in the third period on saturday he nearly single handedly brought the team back from a three goal deficit by scoring two goal and just missing on a couple of more chance later in the game <BRK>the penguin are still a flawed team  like pretty much everyone in the nhl outside of tampa bay  and i m not sure there are enough asset to move or trade to be made over the next week to fix all of those flaw  the penguin  ticket to a deep playoff run is going to be based on how far their superstar can carry them  <BRK>sidney crosby and kris letang have been at that level all season  matt murray ha shown sign of getting back to that level ever since returning to the lineup in the middle of december  and now evgeni malkin is starting to emerge  which could mean that phil kessel start to get lifted out of his recent funk  <BRK>there is no replacement for elite talent playing at their best  and for all of the flaw the penguin have they still have more elite talent than most team in the league  it s just a matter of all of them starting to click at the same time <BRK>maybe we are starting to get to that point  and maybe this weekend with the re emergence of beast mode evgeni malkin is the jumping off point we look back to later this spring <BRK><BRK>
