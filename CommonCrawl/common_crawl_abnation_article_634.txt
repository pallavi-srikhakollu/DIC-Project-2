the raider had one of the nfl s worst record lat year  going     in jon gruden s return to coaching  the   campaign wa marred by injury a well a an almost total teardown of the roster  however  there s plenty of optimism going around raider nation for the   seaon  and those good vibe may be well placed  here are a few reaons that the raider might just be the most improved team in the league this coming year <BRK>   derek carr will be in his second season in jon gruden s system<BRK>jon gruden s offensive system is notoriously complicated  and it must also be said that due to how bad the raider have been during carr s tenure he s basically never been in the same offensive system for more than one season at a time  but this will be carr s second season with gruden  and he ll have a much better grasp of the offense and how to be successful in it  carr showed improvement and a better grasp of the system near the end of last year  and that should continue into   <BRK>   the raider will have better offensive weapon than they ve had since their super bowl run<BRK>oakland s top three receiver in the coming seaon will be antonio brown  tyrell williams and jj nelson  brown is so good that  even if it were him and a pair of traffic cone at receiver  that group would be better than the trio of amari cooper  michael crabtree and seth robert  who is inexplicably still on the team a of this writing   carr and brown are already working out together  getting their timing down  that spell disater for afc defense this coming seaon <BRK>   despite everything going wrong  the raider went     over their last   game in  <BRK>it would have been easy for the raider to pack it up after the  er and charger game  in which oakland scored a total of nine point  but that s not what happened  the raider went down to arizona and won  and they also soundly defeated pittsburgh and denver  at the end of the year  oakland wa playing like a     team  rather than a     team  they bought into gruden s coaching and system and played with heart  that ascent should continue with an improved roster <BRK>   oakland ha four draft pick in the top  <BRK>remember that roster teardown i mentioned before  it wan t for nothing  not only did it create a tremendous amount of cap space  it also netted the raider three extra first rounder in the next two draft  a you all know  the raider have three first rounder this year in one of the deepest defensive draft in recent memory  there are also some quarterback needy team who might want to trade up  giving oakland a chance at even more pick with which to rebuild their roster  the possibility are endless  but in this draft  everything s coming up milhouse <BRK>   the front office ha improved dramatically<BRK>it wa pretty clear lat year that former raider gm reggie mckenzie and jon gruden had some tension  and the power struggle between the two led to mckenzie s dismissal  but the raider  hire of mike mayock a gm ha looked like a materstroke so far  gruden and mayock are old friend who work extremely well together  and every free agent move so far ha addressed and upgraded a huge need on the raider  roster  mayock ha the connection and the tenacity to make a deal happen when he want it  a shown by his dogged pursuit of antonio brown <BRK>the draft will be the real test of mayock and gruden s leadership  mckenzie wa known for some highly questionable pick  especially in the second round  will mayock make the right move  if he doe  the raider could make a playoff push in   and be set up a serious championship contender in la vega <BRK>there are some other team that could also show plenty of improvement next year  the jet  roster will be better  the brown have basically already won their division  the  er hope to have jimmy g under center for a full year  but who is he going to throw to besides george kittle  those team could all be better  but there is no team which ha a very real chance to go from     to a playoff push like the raider  provided they get some true baller in the upcoming draft <BRK>
        oakland area event happening soon
