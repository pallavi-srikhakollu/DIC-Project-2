new york   rachael ostovich took a fight against paige vanzant and   through unfortunate circumstance and a coincidence in booking   ended up tied at the hip with polarizing nfl player turned ufc heavyweight greg hardy  it s been a completely strange and harrowing lead up for the hawaiian flyweight  who ha dealt with more than anybody should ever have to in a fight camp  <BRK>in november  she wa allegedly assaulted by her husband  arnold berdon  and suffered multiple injury   the most severe of which being a cracked orbital bone  which nearly knocked her out of the fight  she ha since filed for divorce  berdon ha been served a restraining order and is set to go on trial for felony assault next month <BRK>then the correlation began  <BRK>upon gaining medical clearance  ostovich opted to stay on this saturday night s fight card in brooklyn   the first in the new espn era   a decision that only served to magnify hardy s past transgression for domestic abuse  back in    hardy   then a pro bowler for the carolina panther   wa found guilty of  assaulting his ex girlfriend  and throwing her onto a pile of gun  though the charge were dismissed on appeal when the victim failed to show up and testify in court  the incident ultimately led to a suspension and his eventual banishment from the nfl  <BRK>because they ended up on a high profile fight card together  the ufc came under scrutiny for allowing it to happen  the most thrown around word during fight week so far ha been  tone deaf    a in  the ufc should know better  but a much a it ha bothered some fan that the ufc opted to keep ostovich and hardy on the same card  it han t bothered ostovich nearly a much  <BRK> from the day my incident occurred until now  everyday it s been a new thing   she told mma fighting at the ufc on espn  medium day thursday   but the greg hardy one wa a big one  i wa like  why is this blowing up  what is going on in the world  it wa so weird  <BRK> i wa trying to do my research via twitter   probably not the best   but i wa like  ok  i have no control over this  this is not my card  bottom line is i m happy to be here  happy to be on the card  it doesn t bother me at all  because i have my own situation  my own problem that i m dealing with  <BRK>in fact  ostovich felt compelled to introduce herself to hardy when she saw him for the first time on tuesday in new york  given that they have been mentioned in the same breath for the last couple of month  she wanted him to know that she wa willing to try and make this weekend a positive experience  rather than a morally questionable one <BRK> i approached him because it had been weighing on my heart ever since it got brought up in the news   she said   i kept thinking  we re fighting on the same card  i m going to see him eventually  i m not the type that want thing to be awkward  i wanted to get it out of the way  so i seen him and i wa like  i have to go say hi to him  i knew i had to  <BRK> i said   hi  i m rachael  it s nice to meet you  i just want you to know that there s no negative feeling between me and you  that the medium can say this and that and blow it out of proportion   <BRK> i told him  hey  let s use this and work together  let s turn these negative issue into positive on both end  and i feel like that s the best thing we can do  if more people focused on that  it would be a lot better  he wa very genuine  very gracious  i felt like he wa grateful that i came up to him  and i felt like the relief wa off of both of our shoulder  <BRK>a couple of month back  when ostovich got the fight with vanzant  it looked like nothing more than a chance to prove herself a a fighter against a ufc commodity on a very big platform  a she navigates fight week  though  ostovich ha morphed into a survivor of domestic violence  not only that  but she know that she is looked upon a an inspiration to her fellow survivor of abuse  and   somehow  in between training and recovery and the whole nexus of emotion   ha made her peace with it  <BRK> i wa in shock at the amount of message i ve received just on instagram   she said   i can t even get into facebook and twitter and all of that  there wa so much  but just on instagram i wa getting flooded with message  thing like   hey  i wa in an eight year relationship and finally got out  stay strong   or   i m still in a relationship   those are the one that are hard for me  the one who are still stuck in their relationship  and they have nowhere to turn to  no support  some of them have kid and can t support themselves financially  this is a worldwide problem  it doesn t just happen in hawaii  it happens to everyone  <BRK> so i m trying to let them know it s not ok  <BRK>it s been one hell of an undertaking  and not one that ostovich could have ever saw coming  one minute she s a fighter  the next minute she s a fighter  one minute it s her versus vanzant  the next it s her against hardy  or her against the ufc s decision making  or her against her own emotion  having to deal with the complexity of a dangerous relationship in public <BRK>people want her to speak out against everything at once  but ostovich say she can t  because the fight is nearing  and that fight is actually the thing that ha kept her grounded through the process <BRK> the fight itself ha been more a sanctuary   she said   i ve been able to take all my frustration out in training  anything that s stressing me out  taking the time out to focus on training or whatever i need to do  finally getting it to this point ha been just a relief  i m so excited to fight  <BRK>the one thing that ostovich isn t doing is walking on eggshell a she discus the problem  even though she admits she would rather be talking about her fight and bouncing back after losing against montana de la rosa lat july  she not only try to humanize with the elephant in the room  hardy   she try to empathize with the medium    <BRK> i understand the obligation of medium   she said   and i understand that thing are a lot more intensified because of the situation that happened in my personal life  to handle it so publicly  it s hard  i m not going to lie  it s hard to deal with all of these emotion <BRK> but  the silver lining is that it would be almost ignorant of me not to use it to help others  and that s what i want to do  and that s what we all should be doing  helping each other  sharing our story  there are so many sharing their story with me  and i m so grateful for that  because it made me feel like i m not alone  so to help someone else and help them be strong and find that motivation and strength to leave those toxic relationship  then so be it  <BRK>it s been a memorable fight camp  even if it s one she d rather forget  but ostovich ha managed to keep pushing forward  on thursday she had many reporter around her  many camera  and many fighter  everyone wanted to know her feeling  she answered the best she could <BRK>which is to say  she tried to explain a series of event that are difficult to understand  even for her <BRK> when i first wa going through it  i wa upset   she said   i wa struggling a bit  i wa asking   why  why   just adjusting to having my personal  private business plastered out there publicly  it wan t just on the island  it wa worldwide  it wa on major news site  so that wa something that wa hard to deal with  i wa hurt  confused  feeling just it s a crazy thing  you never understand it unless you re going through it  <BRK><BRK><BRK>
