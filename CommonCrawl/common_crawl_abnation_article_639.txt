head coach  frank wilson       fourth year <BRK>  record and s p  ranking        th <BRK>projected   record and s p  ranking        th <BRK>five key point <BRK>bill c s annual preview series of every fbs team in college football continues  catch up here <BRK>this is my ninth year of writing this preview series for sb nation  which mean i ve written right at around     preview at this point  after a while  you start to find that you re putting team into certain box and using certain term a crutch  you ve got the hard job  and there are always plenty of those a we work our way through the sun belt  mac  and conference usa   you ve got the year zero situation  you ve got the surprise underachiever and the ahead of schedule overachiever and the a year away from shining builder  i see a lot more pattern than i did when i started at this <BRK>i can still be caught off guard sometimes  though  that s a good thing   wouldn t want to get bored  but i can honestly say that frank wilson s three year utsa tenure fit into no box  that would make sense  i guess  because wilson himself doesn t either <BRK>wilson wa a dominant high school coach at a young age  in    at age    he wa named a nike national coach of the year finalist  that suggests a certain level of tactical organization and ability to motivate  within a couple of year  though  he had taken a left turn and had become an ace recruiter  a charismatic hired gun  for coach like ed orgeron at ole miss  lane kiffin at tennessee  and  for six season  le mile at lsu <BRK>wilson took the utsa job in december of    signed seven three star prospect for his makeshift   class  then signed   in   and   in    considering what he wa inheriting   utsa had slipped from seven win to four to three in larry coker s final two season   it wa easy to try to put him in a p j  fleck like   strip the depth chart down to the stud  then build anew with better prospect  box  only  he doubled the roadrunner  win total in his very first year  then held steady with six more win in year two <BRK>at that point  it wa eay to see him a a rising star  he wa winning more game than expected  and his recruiting hadn t even really kicked in  he had the tactical chop and the ability to attract talent  a rare combination <BRK>then utsa went     in    and it wan t a  young player start slowly  then begin to develop and improve       it wan t a  one unit briefly collapse  then start to rebound       it wa a rousing thud of a      a  should have been           utsa s offense went from bad to second worst in fbs  the defense  which had soared to  th in def  s p  in    crashed to  rd <BRK>there were injury and youth  sure  the quarterback position and receiving corp were revolving door  and with what utsa had to replace heading into     nearly the entire starting offense and a good chunk of the defensive two deep   regression wa imminent  i titled last year s preview  utsa start over again   after all <BRK>but there s regression  and there s this  you want to get better a the year go on  but after a     start  the roadrunner lost their next five game by an average score of     before playing well in a seaon ending loss to north texa <BRK>worse  they don t head into   with a many rising star a you d hope to see after good recruiting and a youth movement  there s some reaon for hope on defense  but utsa still ha to replace lat year s top two havoc producer <BRK>this wan t a reset  it wa a collapse  there are still plenty of former three star prospect in the chamber  plus some intriguing jucos like former lsu quarterback lowell narcisse  but after earning ton of benefit of the doubt in his first two season  wilson spent all of it in    and i have no idea where thing go from here <BRK>

  <BRK>what do you get when you combine an almost completely new starting lineup with an aging new offensive coordinator who hasn t actually coordinated a good offense in quite some time  you get an offensive radar chart that look like an imploded star <BRK>wilson had originally hired frank scelfo a his first oc  scelfo inherited an offense that had averaged a   ranking in off  s p  in the two year before his arrival  and his two utsa offense averaged a   ranking  he wa relieved of his duty and replaced with     al borges <BRK>the nicest thing i could say about the   year old former michigan and auburn offensive coordinator in last year s preview wa that   when he ha a bell cow  he know how to use him   i noted that in running back jalen rhodes  he might have someone capable of taking on a large load and thriving <BRK>rhodes did not thrive  averaging six carry per game and     yard per carry  b j  daniel averaged     and      respectively  with no run game of which to speak  borges had to turn utsa into a pas first attack  the roadrunner had neither the quarterback nor the receiving target to pull that off <BRK>so now borges is gone  a are rhodes  at leat one of the many qbs who got a chance in the lineup  then senior d j  gillins   and no    target greg campbell jr   who produced an extremely replaceable     yard per catch and seven yard per target  the offense won t miss any of those folk all that much  but that doesn t automatically mean their replacement will do any better <BRK>wilson went younger this time  promoting receiver coach jeff katl to the oc job  katl wa chad henne s backup at michigan when the wolverine nearly made the bcs title game in    and he served time a a ga or analyst at auburn  michigan  and lsu  where he met wilson   he certainly didn t do much a receiver coach and pasing game coordinator lat year  but we ll see what he can do with full rein <BRK>he ll have plenty of former star recruit itching to make an impression and plenty of unproven option within each unit <BRK>lofty recruiting ranking mean you ll always be considered to have potential  therefore this offense ha plenty of it  but kastl ha absolutely nothing proven to lean on and ha to hope that last year s ineptness ha turned this group into a weathered  chip on shoulder group that rise together  hard to count on that  though <BRK>a daily ish mini column on the college football thing of the day  with some other stuff too <BRK>here s my positive spin for describing utsa s defensive collapse  at least only one part of the defense collapsed <BRK>the roadrunner  defensive run game remained solid in    ranking  st in rushing s p   allowing four or more yard on just   percent of non sack carry   rd  and stuffing ball carrier at or behind the line   percent of the time   th   granted  a lot of those stuff came from senior who aren t around anymore   linebacker josiah tauaefa and le maruo  weakside safety darryl godfrey  tackle kevin strong jr    but not all of them  the roadrunner got contribution from quite a few linemen  and strong s is potentially the only departure <BRK>so there s that <BRK>for that matter  the roadrunner also got a pretty sterling contribution from cornerback cassius grady  who got burned here and there but managed to combine     tackle for loss with four interception and five breakup <BRK>still  even with grady and a decent pas rush  utsa s pas defense disintegrated  the roadrunner allowed a   percent completion rate   th  and ranked  th in pasing s p   defensive coordinator jason rollins lined his corner up tight on the line of scrimmage and tried to get aggressive  five db made at least     tfls each  which you don t see often   but outside of grady  they didn t make enough play to offset the one they were giving up <BRK>experience should be rollins  friend  though  losing tauaefa and maruo  a k a  the lb who saw nearly every snap of the season  hurt  but the front and back of the defense boast plenty of veteran <BRK>up front  lorenzo dantzler lead a deep set of defensive end   he and dequarius henry combined for     tfls and     sack  and senior jarrod carter mclin is solid against the run   and while losing strong hurt  senior tackle king newton is a keeper <BRK>in the back  the roadrunner have to replace godfrey and free safety c j  levine  but carl austin iii return after missing   with injury  and his   production wa extremely similar to levine s  and every cornerback return  for better or worse <BRK>this defense will be heavy on junior and senior who were in lat year s rotation  and they add former virginia linebacker dominic sheppard  former arizona cornerback antonio park  and a pair of three star jucos  linebacker trevor harmanson and safety savion harris  a well  this will be a seaoned and solid unit <BRK>utsa had it second straight awesome special team unit in     nd in special team s p    and one half of the reason for that success return <BRK>the roadrunner were  th in field goal efficiency and  th in punt efficiency  place kicker jared sackett    for   on field goal longer than   yard  is back  but punter yannis routsas      average with almost no returnable kick  isn t  return man matt guidry is solid  too  so this should be a solid unit again <BRK>i just don t know <BRK>the utsa defense should be pretty good again in    boasting a combination of experience and upside that few in conference usa can match  the corner did indeed get burned a lot  but they have quantity on their side   if the veteran don t work out  there are quite a few three star youngster waiting for a chance  and the line could be disruptive enough to help them out  i don t have many worry there <BRK>or at leat  i don t have a many worry a on offense  it s just a giant pile of rubble  high upside rubble  sure  but this unit ha almost no proven entity to lean on  all that strong recruiting produced almost nothing of note <BRK>there s still time  though  kastl s offense will boast a lot of sophomore with potential  and while that probably only mean so much for    there s still time to build continuity and something of a track record <BRK>s p  is bearish  it s probably underselling the defense a bit  and d alone could earn a few win against a schedule that feature five opponent projected worse than  th  but it s not forecasting much from a team that so thoroughly bottomed out last year <BRK>wilson surprised me  for good reason  not too long ago  and he could again  he better  at least <BRK>all   preview data to date <BRK>
