last sunday  james harden had one of the strangest box score in memory  the detail that jump off the page  and ended up in chyrons and app alert   the reigning mvp scored   point on   field goal attempt while going   of   on three pointer   <BRK> the   point on   shot is good  typically  you want your scorer to have more point than shot  that indicates better than one point per shot  or the equivalent of shooting   percent off the floor  sort of  we ll get to why that s misleading in a minute  <BRK> the     from three line is an abomination  before sunday s game  no nba player had ever taken   or more three pointer and made just zero or one  due to injury  the rocket don t have many offensive option other than harden shooting  harden is very in sync with the moreyball standard that three and free throw are the best shot  so he kept driving  we ll get to that  and taking three  the three kept missing   <BRK>

   <BRK> so how doe a guy who shoot     on three pointer end up with what look like an efficient box score  it s the free throw  harden went     from the line  <BRK> here s the thing that make that whole    point on   shot  efficient looking line misleading  the free throw are factored into the   point  rightfully so   the free throw are not factored into the   shot  wrongly so   <BRK> free throw aren t free  other than and  s and technical  free throw actually do use up possession just like field goal attempt  but due to ease of quick assessment or whatever  they are rarely counted in surface level    point on   shot  type analysis  <BRK> yes  harden scored   point with   field goal attempt  but those   free throw also used possession   <BRK> how many  unfortunately  the box score won t tell u   this is an improvement the otherwise highly advanced modern nba com boxscores could add   we can estimate that the number of shooting possession from free throw is roughly half since there are two free throw per normal trip  but this neglect and  s  three pointer foul  and free throw  metric minded analyst ue a     multiplier a an estimate  this is the figure cooked into true shooting percentage   but that s not very elegant in shorthand  no one want to say that harden scored   point on an estimated     shooting possession  <BRK>

   <BRK> a quick perusal of the play by play for sunday s game show that harden s   free throw came on just six shooting possession  three three pointer foul  three standard two shot foul  and one and   that doesn t count a a shooting possession itself because the field goal attempt is already counted   sixteen free throw in six shooting possession is pretty wild itself  it completely subverts the standard     multiplier   that mean that true shooting percentage might actually underrate harden s scoring efficiency  but that s another spelunking for another day    <BRK> those six scoring possession that ended with free throw can then be added to the   field goal attempt for our total number of shooting possession used by harden to get those   point     <BRK> so harden scored   point in   shooting possession  that doesn t seem so efficient after all  but it s more accurate and reflective of harden s total scoring efficiency against the magic than the   on   line  <BRK> now we just need to find an elegant way to incorporate the point created by harden s   assist with just four turnover into that quick reference line     <BRK> nba news and link delivered to your inbox each weekday  so you never miss out  <BRK>
