a i watched the ref blow his whistle to conclude the lackluter     draw between atlanta united and philadelphia union sunday night  the frutration that ha been building since the loss to dc united came to a head  i wa frutrated with the boring display of soccer we witnessed  i wa frutrated that    possession ended with u having le expected goal  xg  than philadelphia  i wa frutrated that the atmosphere wa flat  i wa frutrated that i wan t having fun  <BRK>win  lose  or draw  typically under tata martino  atlanta united were at least entertaining  sure  a game here or there left you wanting  but we d follow up with an attacking onslaught in the next one  outside of the herediano game at kennesaw state  i ve been bored with the possession style of soccer and i m sure you have  too <BRK>so  let s dive into what is wrong with our beloved atlanta united <BRK>    everyone having to figure out what they are supposed to be doing in the        player are being too scared to make run into the box out of fear that their defensive responsibility will not be picked up by a teammate  everyone is worried about the back three being caught in an unfavorable counter attack when atlanta inevitably give up possession <BRK>    the       playing key player out of their strength  <BRK>    key player playing poorly because of     they re gassed or they re just playing below their shown ability <BRK>and<BRK>    terrible personnel decision <BRK>i refuse to place all of atlanta united s issue on a formation  a you ll see below  the issue are four fold  i also think that the five stripe  faithful are placing way too much hope that the       formation is the savior of the attack or that someone like guillermo barros schelotto or another       disciple would be faring better <BRK>in theory  the       should be more attacking than the        in the        the fullback will occaionally get involved with the attack  and you see this more with super club budget that can pay top dollar for great defending fullback that double a winger  however  in ml  and traditionally  the four in the back are there to support the attack but focus on defending  furthermore  even when the midfield is set up with a cam  one of the three midfielders will adopt a defensive role  so  you re typically going forward with five player meant for attack <BRK>the       dedicates seven player for attack  and while they all don t attack at once  it is created to be a more diverse attack meant to unlock team parking the bus  it s been the opposite for the five stripe  the       is always a fluid shape that requires all player to read the attack and adopt different responsibility based on their teammate  movement and the opponent s reaction  it take time and experience to learn this give and take  while you re learning  you are more hesitant to risk  that s what we re watching play out  a team with    possession but only   shot on goal <BRK>for this reason  i believe frank de boer when he say the chance will come later in the season  with time come experience  with experience come confidence  with confidence come accepting risk  with risk come attack  i just don t know how many more possession based non attacking performance i can stomach  <BRK> narrator   all of them  he s addicted to this team <BRK>so sure  the       work out in time  great  okay <BRK>but the       doe not play many of the player to their strength  <BRK>a currently used  eric remedi is a problem  he is not an attacking or link up cm  he doesn t have those tool in the toolbox  however  he is great with keeping possession and defending in the middle of the field  he is the prototypical cdm and ha had motm performance when used there in    right now  a a cm in the        he s being aked to do thing that he isn t capable of doing <BRK>presently  darlington nagbe is being asked to do too much in defense  nagbe  by nature  need to link up or be a possession cm  he ha shown his talent in his possession and passing ability towards goal  see josef s goal against monterrey   but let s not kid ourselves  he is not a     he s not going to consistently fill the space behind josef  the team doesn t have that player in it current midfield <BRK>there is now enough data to show that in ml  ezequiel barco is not a winger  if it didn t work under tata  it sure isn t going to work under de boer  the kid is a baller centrally a a cam  you saw it once he came on against union  put him a a cam and be done with it <BRK>atlanta s personnel scream for a        but the formation isn t a savior if de boer doesn t want to attack  my only solace is that maybe the stuff about escobar s injury    cb is true  and frank will shift to a       when he s back  he ran that at ajax and averaged   goal per game <BRK>like mentioned above  maybe it s because they re being asked to do thing they can t do  it would demonstrate some of the attacking issue  <BRK>atlanta united ha also had some injury  george bello  who would be first choice lwb  han t played since the first game  gressel picked up an injury at a key time  escobar broke a collarbone on the second day of practice and han t played at all  nagbe  picked up a knock  and missed time  so  the team han t been at full strength  which really isn t an excuse because in soccer  team are rarely    healthy  however  the replacement have not played to the level needed <BRK>one of the most disappointing element to the slow start is big offseaon addition pity martinez  a heir apparent to miguel almiron  he just han t gelled with this team yet  pity need to take this international break to regain   something  adjusting to a new country  absolutely  fitness  sure  turf  get out of here with that excuse  pity isn t playing up to his caliber   yet  he s not winning  v s  he wa forgettable and added nothing to the side sunday night  he s gased and need a break  he s about to get one  let s hope he come back a different player <BRK>tito lover  jump to the next section  gressel need to be the starting rw  i love tito  but he s not a starter for u  he s the perfect supersub when he can run against tired leg and his speed can take advantage where his lack of technical ability can t  against fresh leg  he s limited  he lack the first touch and ability in close proximity to sutain attack early in game  however  after the defender have   minute of fatigue  there s no better player in ml to abue the tired side  he is who he is and that ha a lot of value late in game <BRK>brad guzan ha not been stellar  his gaff against acosta s strike come to mind  the defense let him down against union on their lone goal  but he couldn t make a challenge  he ha had some superb stop  but he ha not played up to his ceiling this season <BRK>michael parkhurst look tired  he s been the epitome of the ml professional for year  but father time is catching up  i believe he is first man out when franco escobar return  <BRK>brek shea had a coming out party in the second leg against herediano  i wa excited about the prospect of him playing with better teammate  since then  he ha shown u that he is the same player a he wa in vancouver  he is limited and cannot fully support the attack becaue he ha to compensate for his defense  if the team go        he s not a lb and i don t know how he make the starting xi <BRK>after the monterrey game  doug roberson of the ajc wrote   de boer said with escobar out  and no ready replacement at right fullback  the coaching staff made the decision in the preseaon to go with a       formation   this pose a big question  how doe one man s injury dictate the formation the coach want to use  the answer is that the roster only ha one rb on it  and don t call gressel a rb  he s not   atlanta should have a backup rb  but while that s a front office issue  de boer ha made mistake a well <BRK>against monterrey  he didn t sub until the  th minute  then he subbed three  that just doesn t make sense  <BRK>maybe the team had to focus on defense so much that once de boer made the       decision that it still han t worked the kink out  however  atlanta united ha been shifting to multiple formation the past two game with nothing of substance to show  de boer ha had   month to learn his personnel  i don t see how he watch the game and can conclude that remedi is an attacking cm  shea is lwb or lb  barco is a winger  and parky can play lb  the positioning of player in the formation that he s trying is not leading to success <BRK>atlanta united need a cam like it need oxygen  the team is inept without it  barco came in  and even though he started at the wing  the five stripe were dangerous when he wa central  his header  the dummy  his dribble in the box   someone need to fill that space behind josef  barco is the guy to do it  <BRK>a weird a it sound  the       could work after these player gel in the        i don t think atlanta could have started   in the       even though the team dominated in that formation in the playoff  atlanta had to evolve into it  the team may need to evolve to a three centerback formation this year a well  even still  the roster doesn t have the cm to make the       work  <BRK>although it s a work in progress  two point out of a possible nine with two game at home against the bottom of the east is unacceptable  atlanta united is running out of time <BRK>
