in a somewhat surprising move  the chief have fired bob sutton  the only defensive coordinator andy reid ha employed in his tenure a the head coach in kansa city  it s only surprising because reid is supremely loyal  not because of the result on the field  i ll discus this firing  plus put a bow on the chief  seaon after their     overtime loss to the patriot on sunday  <BRK> i wa in attendance for the first afc championship game at arrowhead stadium  the chief fan brought it  it wa loud  even my brother mitch schwartz commented to me after the game it wa the loudest he d ever heard arrowhead  so credit to the fan  i truly enjoyed the experience  even with the loss  and chief fan  i know you re depressed about the outcome of the game  but there s a lot to be hopeful about   starting with your franchise quarterback   <BRK> mahomes  while not playing terribly well in the first half  wa money in the second half  the chief scored   second half point     in   play  that s amazing  mahomes wa calm  cool  and collected  it wa most noticeable on the late fourth quarter drive to tie the game  the chief have their quarterback and he s on a rookie contract  that s the first step to success in the nfl  <BRK> it go beyond just mahomes  though  the chief are set at both tackle position  both guard position  and have a dynamic tight end  travis kelce  under contract  the chief have zero issue at running back  or even finding another back if needed  all of their receiver are back  including tyreek hill on the last year of his rookie contract  the chief would be wise to extend him now   <BRK> however  and i ve said this often  i m not sure paying top money for a receiver is worth it  but the chief are kind of stuck here  they have to spend every draft pick on defense so finding a replacement for hill  if they wanted  could be tough  that s why hill will be extended this offseason  the chief  offense  which wa the third highest scoring offense of all time  is all back   <BRK> now to the defense  reid let go of sutton  who had been his defensive coordinator for the pat six seaon  it felt like time  the chief  defense ha been in the bottom third in the nfl for the lat three seaon  they do some thing well  like rush the paser  but just can t stop the run at all  the chief have been stubborn to make adjustment on defense and it seemed a though the player  through quote and twitter  are happy about the decision to move on from sutton  <BRK> while this isn t a complete defense of sutton  the loss to the patriot wasn t totally his fault  he didn t align dee ford offside  there s a difference between bad scheme design and player playing poorly  there s also a blurry area between those two where player aren t being taught the proper technique to play in that defense  lastly  it s up to the front office to bring in player that fit the scheme  while fan love to think coach often change their base scheme  they don t   <BRK> look at sunday  the patriot are a man coverage team  they ran man coverage  they doubled hill  it wa exactly what wa expected  they twisted upfront to generate pressure  their player played better in the scheme  is that coaching  probably  are their secondary player better than the chief  yes  <BRK> people will point to the overtime a the lat straw for sutton  the chief allowed three third and   conversion playing cover two man  two man is a popular defense in these situation  it allows for man to man coverage plus two deep safety to help in either direction  on the first third down  there s one guy open on a blown coverage   <BRK> on the second third and    it s the same coverage and same route concept  the chief  defender is there  but the throw is better  the patriot win that rep  <BRK> on the final third and   of the drive  the chief run cover     man coverage with one safety deep  they made the adjustment and dropped the weakside safety into the box  however  new england doesn t run the same route concept  instead the patriot called a play that wasn t on their call sheet  they saw eric berry shading to the outside early in the game in this formation  so they called a slant  peter king ha the detail in his weekly football morning in america column  <BRK> so  is that on sutton  did he adjust one third down too late  did the patriot outsmart him or make an adjustment based on berry   <BRK> while i support finding another defensive coordinator  i don t think the chief  defensive fix is a simple a that  they will need to find better secondary piece to run man coverage scheme  they have chris jones under contract for one more year  but they need to re sign defensive lineman dee ford  they will probably move on from berry  so drafting a safety will be a must  <BRK> improving the run defense will require better player  they need a stronger nose tackle  they are stuck with reggie ragland and anthony hitchens  but maybe those player can be taught new technique  <BRK> will a fresh defensive coordinator with outside the box thinking and the willingness to adjust on his foot better improve the defense  yes it will  but in coordination with that  the chief must draft player who fit their scheme and can play right away  it can be done  but it won t be easy  <BRK> with all that being said  the future is bright in kansa city  a young quarterback on a rookie contract with all the offensive weapon back  a new defensive coordinator will fire up that unit  look for the chief to be back in this game next season  <BRK>
