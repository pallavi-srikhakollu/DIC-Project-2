we re officially underway in the   ncaa tournament a fairleigh dickinson and belmont picked up win in the first four to join the official bracket  fdu s jahlil jenkins and darnell edge lit it up in the first game  getting the tournament off to a spicy start a the knight overcame a   point deficit to earn a shot at gonzaga  in the second game  belmont and temple traded the lead until the bruin pulled away down the stretch   <BRK> this season s bracket fascinates me because the top eight team all have extremely legitimate shot at a national title  while i think there could be a ton of upset in the early round  thing are going to get super chalky in the elite eight   <BRK> last year  i  like many  had a terrible bracket that wa decimated after virginia lost to umbc  this year  i ll learn nothing and pick the wahoo all the way to the championship game   <BRK>

zion williamson  duke doe  pick  duke <BRK>    vcu v     ucf  a is the cae with every     game  this one is a tough pick  ucf ha tacko fall  and while i desperately want to see him matchup against zion  i think vcu s defense doe enough to hold on in this one  pick  vcu <BRK>    mississippi state v     liberty  the flame will give mississippi state a game  but i don t think they have enough to overcome quinndary witherspoon and the bulldog  pick  mississippi state <BRK>    virginia tech v     saint louis  the hokies get justin robinson back after a toe injury that sidelined the star guard for the last   game of the season  including the acc tournament   with robinson back  vt will be able to move nickeil alexander walker back into more of a pure shooter role than a distributor role  pick  virginia tech <BRK>    maryland v     belmont  maryland is one of the big ten team limping into the tournament a they lost three of their lat four game played  belmont will keep this one close  but can t get their second ncaa tournament win  pick  maryland <BRK>    lsu v     yale  i really want to pick the bulldog  like  really  really want to pick them  miye oni is a baller  and the elis have the  th best efg  in the country   but  their defense is not great  lsu still won t have will wade on the sideline  but i think the tiger are just too much in this one  pick  lsu <BRK>    louisville v     minnesota  i mean  louisville i guess  the most interesting thing about this game is that the committee put richard pitino against poppa pitino s old squad  jordan nwora is the real deal and a ton of fun to watch  so   yeah  the card  pick  louisville <BRK>    michigan state v     bradley  michigan state without a doubt  pick  michigan state <BRK>    duke v     vcu   check roster  yep  duke still ha zion williamson  pick  duke <BRK>    virginia tech v     mississippi state  sticking with the hokies moving on to the sweet    kerry blackshear ha been great in the post and ty outlaw is one of the best three point shooter in the country at      pick  va tech <BRK>    maryland v     lsu  battle of the bigs  i m extremely here for this game  maryland s jaylen smith and bruno fernando are a good a frontcourt a any in the country  and they ll have their hand full with lsu s naz reid  the terps won t have enough outside shooting  so i m going with lsu to move on in a close one  pick  lsu <BRK>    michigan state v     louisville  the cardinal somehow squeaked out an ot win over the spartan back in late november  but i don t think they get the season sweep  ryan mcmahon had   point in the win  msu most likely won t have kyle ahrens in the tournament due to an injury in the big ten title game  but the spartan have enough with cassius winston  nick ward  and matt mcquaid  pick  michigan state <BRK>    duke v     virginia tech  now thing are getting interesting  duke lost to virginia tech in blacksburg in the regular season when duke wa without zion and vt wa without robinson  the hokies will make a game of it  but duke s superstar are too much down the stretch  pick  duke <BRK>    michigan state v     lsu  so much chalk  msu take this one in an extremely physical matchup  pick  michigan state <BRK>    duke v     michigan state  if we don t actually get this game  i will be furious  some were surprised msu got stuck in the eat region with duke a the spartan could have reaonably been a no    seed themselves  instead  they got matched up with the no    overall seed in the blue devil  msu will make duke pay for their mistake  but zion hit a game winner late  pick  duke <BRK>    gonzaga v     fairleigh dickinson  jahlil jenkins and darnell edge were awesome in the first four  but the zag have too good of an offense  pick  gonzaga <BRK>    syracuse v     baylor  what s that you say  syracuse in the ncaa tournament  gotta go with the orange  pick  syracuse <BRK>    marquette v     murray state  i literally looked like the heart eye emoji when they announced this game  ja morant v  markus howard  superstar v  superstar  can we just keep whichever one loses and replace one of the pac   team  no  fine  let s go with the racer a the golden eagle closed the regular seaon with four straight loss  pick  murray state <BRK>    florida state v     vermont  fsu is very  very good  they should be a no    seed  the catamount aren t bad  but the length and athleticism of the seminole will be too much for them to overcome  pick  florida state <BRK>    buffalo v     st  john s  buffalo is under seeded  in my opinion  the bull are no    on kenpom  and have the no    offense and no    defense  cj massinburg is a legit star  and i think the bull are just too much for st  john s  pick  buffalo <BRK>    texas tech v     northern kentucky  de fense  clap clap  de fense  clap clap  the red raider have both the no    defense and jarrett culver  their offense ha struggled at time  but they won t have a problem with the norse  pick  texas tech <BRK>    nevada v     florida  kenpom ha this a a pick  em  one point nevada win   and vega favor the wolfpack by two  nevada is prone to falling behind early and using drive and three from the martin twin to climb back in  the gator have finished the seaon strong and seem to be peaking at the right time  despite jordan caroline being one of my favorite player  i think florida get this in a close one  pick  florida <BRK>    michigan v     montana  michigan got a bad draw in having to play the same team they faced in the opening round last year  that montana team wa much better than this one  and the wolverine rolled  they ll roll again  pick  michigan <BRK>    gonzaga v     syracuse  syracuse against gonzaga  no history there  right  in    the orange snuck by gonzaga by three to make the elite eight where they upset virginia to make a final four  this year  the zag get revenge  pick  gonzaga <BRK>    murray state v     florida state  the ja morant cinderella story end here  mfiondu kabengele and the seminole do just enough to slow down the racer and move to the sweet    pick  florida state <BRK>    texas tech v     buffalo   upset pick  buffalo to the sweet    the bull have a tough defense and will make thing hard enough for ttu to score that they move on  pick  buffalo <BRK>    michigan v     florida  i ve seen this bowl game before  iggy brazdeikis  jordan poole  charles matthew  and jon teske are just too much for the gator in this one  pick  michigan <BRK>    gonzaga v     florida state  sticking with fsu s length and their ability to disrupt the zag on offense  the seminole don t have the best offense  but they are strong enough to keep gonzaga honest  this should be an amazing game  so i hope we get to see it  pick  florida state <BRK>    michigan v     buffalo  after seeing the no    defense in ttu  thing only let up slightly for buffalo with michigan s no    defense  it s too much for the bull in back to back game and they run out of steam in the second half  pick  michigan <BRK>    michigan v     florida state  another great game if we can get it  i like michigan s defense here a the big men inside can bang with the best of them  i don t trust fsu s shooting enough for them to get enough on michigan s defense  pick  michigan <BRK>    virginia v     gardner webb  this is not remotely an exciting game  ok  move on let s just not talk about it  what could go wrong  pick  virginia <BRK>    ole miss v     oklahoma   long pause  umm  ole miss  pick  ole miss <BRK>    wisconsin v     oregon  i refuse to pick a pac   team  and oregon s

state v     uc irvine  this is the bad combo of a hot double digit seed meeting a power   school with injury  the anteater beat up on the big west conference  winning both the regular season and
