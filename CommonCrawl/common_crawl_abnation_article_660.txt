hello  and welcome to tactically naive  brought to you this week by broken laptop charger socket  and the lovely people who fix them <BRK>friend  we need to talk about arsenal <BRK>let s begin with a general theory of the premier league  thanks to the hyperactive  overclocked  and extremely online nature of the thing  all the club involved exist in one of two state  crisis  and pre crisis <BRK>more from andi thomas <BRK>choupo moting had one of the worst missed goal in history so that we could sin<BRK>ole gunnar solskj√¶r is manchester united s latest exercise in hope<BRK>zidane s return to real madrid may be even better than his departure<BRK>brendan rodgers may be what leicester city need  even if he isn t perfect<BRK>defender should stop kicking neymar just because he clowned them<BRK>crisis you ll be familiar with  losing game  or  for big club with big idea  winning game but not very well  the manager frustrated with the player  the player disaffected with the manager  the fan and the boardroom united in despair at the league position  when it come to arsenal  this mean booing at the emirate  laminated a  sign  and viral video of angry men shouting at one another about hector bellerin <BRK>pre crisis is a little trickier to pin down  since much of it only come into focus once crisis kick off properly  but then  perhaps  we don t need to define it too precisely  it s all the thing that happen  and all the thing that don t happen  all the thing that  by their occurrence or not  could in the fullness of time bring about proper  full blown  broken crest on the back page crisis <BRK>or to put it another way  everything <BRK>and this seaon  nobody is storing up pre crisis energy like arsenal  the entire club is aquiver with explosive potential  the defence is a mess  and the midfield is a nice idea  mesut ozil is being paid to play fortnite  while aaron ramsey is heading off somewhere much more sensible  there are strange rumbling off the field a well  sven mislintat  brought in to reproduce borussia dortmund s transfer brilliance  is leaving after just over a year <BRK>this is all exacerbated by arsene wenger and the timing of his departure  of course  the great man had every right to stay a long he liked  when the club have changed their name to honour you  there s no need to go rushing out of the door  but the fact that he stayed for so long pat the peak of his effectiveness  and left the club a much punchline a powerhouse  mean that any patience unai emery might have asumed he had wa spent long ago  unfair  perhaps  but such is life  there s only so much transition a club can take before  well  crisis <BRK>all of which mean that they should be a mess   and yet  somehow  they re not  not quite  they re almost there  smoke is trickling from the mountain top  the ground is shuddering underfoot  and everybody s checking to make sure their dog are near at hand  but every time the explosion threatens to come  it get delayed again  last weekend they lost to west ham in miserable fashion  and the mislintat news broke  and  chelsea  h   loomed up big and ominous  here come the boo  the glorious boo  right <BRK>wrong  chelsea were rubbish  arsenal were efficient in the first half and comfortable in the second  and so everything ha simmered down again  just a little  a with the victory over spur  emery and his player have bought themselves another month or so of pre crisis <BRK>perhaps this is how success at post wenger arsenal is going to have to go  if they can ride out the bump  stave off the moment of total catastrophe  and keep bouncing along the edge of disaster without ever actually collapsing into it  then emery and his team might just get the time to do   well  whatever it is that they are trying to do  <BRK>
