antonio brown missed an important week   game against the bengal   and it may not have been because of an injury  instead  the all pro wide receiver may have been held out of the game due to disciplinary issue that tie back to an increasingly volatile steelers locker room  that s not where the drama end  either <BRK>after the steelers  season finale  pittsburgh post gazette staff writer gerry dulac and ed bouchette reported that brown s trip to the inactive list wan t due to a balky knee like head coach mike tomlin told the press that sunday  instead  his absence wa a disciplinary reaction that came after a week filled with missed team activity and an argument with an unnamed teammate  <BRK>while the steelers were able to win without their star wideout  a sputtering offense made thing much more difficult that expected against a spiraling bengal team  while that gave pittsburgh the victory it needed to stay alive in the playoff race  the raven  nailbiting win over the brown clinched the afc north for baltimore and all but eliminated the steelers from playoff contention <BRK>since then  brown ha not spoken to anyone in the organization  team owner art rooney ii also told the post gazette that while the steelers would not release brown this offseason   all other option are on the table   brown took the small step of removing  pittsburgh steelers  from his twitter bio  <BRK>while dulac and bouchette don t name who the confrontation wa with  nfl network scribe aditi kinkhabwala reported that multiple source had told her brown and quarterback ben roethlisberger

gazette s report <BRK>steelers receiver antonio brown did not play in the season ending game against the cincinnati bengal because he elected to sit out practice last week after an unspecified heated dispute with a teammate  the pittsburgh post gazette ha learned <BRK>several source said the steelers  decision to not play brown against the bengal had nothing to do with any type of knee injury <BRK>the disagreement occurred wednesday morning during a routine walk through practice that precedes their regular afternoon practice on the south side  brown became disgusted and threw a football in anger at one of his teammate  several source said <BRK>   <BRK>he did not attend saturday s walk through practice and skipped the saturday night meeting at the team hotel   the latest in missed meeting by the all pro receiver  brown wa never on the field for the start of the game against the bengal and left heinz field at halftime  according to multiple source <BRK>dulac and bouchette s report also suggested brown showed up to the locker room on sunday morning expecting to play  only to be shut down by tomlin  this further annoyed teammate  who called brown s behavior  embarrassing  and  the worst i ve seen   <BRK>espn s report gave more context to what brown wa emotional about <BRK>brown got upset that roethlisberger wanted to run a hot read over again during a walk through  so coach sent another player to run the play  a source close to the situation told espn nfl insider adam schefter  brown got upset  left practice and talked with roethlisberger afterward  telling the quarterback that he felt underappreciated and had issue with people in the organization  the source told schefter <BRK>however  roethlisberger said the report were blown out of proportion and that everything between brown and him is fine   despite brown not replying to any of his teammate  text in the past few day <BRK> that s what baffling to me  people are making a big deal about a walkthrough on wednesday  a fight between he and i   roethlisberger said on his weekly radio show on     the fan   if there wa a blowup or something  i sure of heck didn t see it  i m not sure where that come from  <BRK>former packer receiver and current nfl network analyst james jones said that he ha heard that roethlisberger and brown have a bit of a shaky relationship and roethlisberger could be an antagonizer to brown <BRK> i have talked to a couple people in the pittsburgh steelers organization and they told me this ha been lingering on   jones said   i ve been told in meeting  roethlisberger  would take shot at ab  like   i don t got to throw you the ball   and thing like that  wednesday in practice  i heard he ran the wrong route  big ben threw the ball on the ground  said   get him out of here  get somebody else in there   and that s when ab wa at his boiling point and that s when he went off  <BRK>offensive coordinator randy fichtner refused to discus brown s absence after he missed thursday s team activity  an out of character response toward a player working through an injury  but a telling one for a healthy scratch from the mid week practice  <BRK>month later  brown would take to twitter to expand on his issue with the veteran quarterback <BRK>no conflict just a matter of respect  mutual respect  he ha a owner mentality like he can call out anybody including coach  player know but they can t say anything about it otherwise they meal ticket gone  it s a dirty game within a game   truth http   t co mssybvd ny<BRK>that may not have been the only time  though <BRK> he left the team three time   pittsburgh post gazette reporter ed bouchette said   once for a week in training camp that they covered up  they said he had an injury and he really didn t  once on a monday after they lost to kansa city and he threw a fit on the sideline and didn t show up monday  and then at the end of the season  <BRK>on an episode of  the shop  that aired on hbo on mar     brown explained the final week <BRK> i m a little banged up so i meet with coach tomlin and i m telling him   hey man i m banged up so i m gonna need some time to get right   and he wa like   if you re banged up  you can just go home    brown said   like you ain t even gotta be here  so i m like  damn  that s where we re at  <BRK> i m going to war for these guy  putting my life on the line but it s an unknown when it come to me just like right now with the write ups  they control the narrative  we ain t standing on good foundation  and they can just paint you any kind of way  that s the thing people don t know  it s kind of a controlled environment to where they can kind of determine if they want to let me in or not  <BRK> damn  that s where we at   ab  dish on the pivotal final week of the  steelers season   theshophbo pic twitter com kbyiunhl d<BRK>on his relationship with roethlisberger  brown on  the shop  claimed a clash of ego between the two   i don t have an ego   he said   i m just trying to win <BRK> all year dude called me out  we d lose a game and he d be like   ab should have ran a better route    brown said   that s the type of guy he is  he feel like he s the owner  bro  tou threw that shit to the d line  how the fuck am i running a bad route  you need to give me a better ball  <BRK>tomlin met with report for his end of the season press conference and outlined what happened with brown s injury in the week leading up to the bengal game  tomlin said the wide receiver  expressed soreness in his lower body  on wednesday  specifically his foot  ankle  and knee  on thursday and friday  brown wa still experiencing discomfort  so he wa placed on the injury report and then wa sent to get an mri  tomlin said that brown did not end up going through with the mri <BRK>tomlin said that brown did not communicate with him on friday evening and saturday  a expected  it wan t until sunday morning  when brown s agent drew rosenhaus reached out to tomlin to let him know brown wa feeling better  that the team had any update about brown  <BRK>at that point  tomlin told brown that  the best thing wa to be there and support his teammate   because brown wa mia from friday evening until sunday morning  tomlin said the team didn t know the extent of his injury and that s why he didn t play <BRK> he wa absent due to injury and lack of information   tomlin said  <BRK>the two spoke prior to the game  but they haven t had any communication since  tomlin added that he doesn t know if brown left the stadium during the game  <BRK> obviously we take his lack of communication  his lack of presence particularly on saturday prior to the game  to be something that is very significant and it will be handled appropriately so  i m not going to speculate on trade and thing of that nature  we haven t formally received a request in that regard  so i m not going to speculate in term of where the discipline might go and thing of that nature  just know that it s going to be addressed  and it will be addressed  it need to be addressed  for obvious reason  <BRK>when brown wa on the field  he wa still an elite receiver    marked his sixth straight     yard season  and that kind of performance  and the    million dead money on his contract  would make him difficult to trade away   especially for a team so reliant on a bludgeoning aerial attack  it also give him a little more leeway when it come to getting away with locker room shenanigan  like in   when he gave the patriot some bulletin board material by recording tomlin talking about new england in the locker room after a divisional round victory over the chief  <BRK>the cap hit alone wouldn t stop the steelers from trading brown  though  there are way to make it work if they wanted to   which they might <BRK>rooney made it clear that they won t cut brown  but a trade ha not been ruled out  a he told the post gazette <BRK> whether the situation can be reconciled and have him back on the team next year  we re a long way away from thinking that can happen  we re not closing the door on anything at this point  <BRK>rooney also said it would be  hard to envision  brown reporting to steelers training camp in july  but that thing could change <BRK>that square with what nfl network s ian rapoport reported a few day earlier  that the steelers are open to trading brown and they will at the very least  listen to trade offer  <BRK>from  nflgameday  the  steelers are open to trading wr antonio brown and we look into what it mean  here is the link to my story from earlier  http   t co rcumj vrqm  pic twitter com be hehvbdh<BRK>rapoport also said that plenty of team would be interested in brown  particularly the bronco  and the steelers could get a  significant return  for him   but perhaps not a first round pick like the raider got for trading amari cooper to the cowboy  <BRK>brown wa also allegedly involved in a domestic dispute in january of    the nfl is now investigating the incident  <BRK>that doesn t mean the steelers will trade brown  but it s more of a possibility than it ever seemed before  <BRK>on february  th  brown posted a message on his twitter and instagram account saying thanking steelers fan and that it wa time for him to move on  <BRK>thank you steelernation for a big   year   time to move on and forward              newdemands pic twitter com fbiofndqk <BRK>brown han t been traded or released  but brown ha officially asked for a trade <BRK>antonio brown ha not been traded nor ha he been released  but brown want a trade and he officially ha requested that from the steelers  per source <BRK>he met with rooney  the team s owner  to discus his future in february  that may not have worked out so well for the steelers  brown took to facebook live   his medium of choice   to tell team to call him  but only if they re offering guaranteed money <BRK> if your squad want to win and your squad want a hungry wide receiver who s the best in the whole world  someone hit my phone   said brown   tell them i ain t doing no unguarantees  i ain t even gonna play myself no more for this nfl      i think i done everything  what y all think  what s left for me to do  win a super bowl  gotta be the right team for that  right      if your team got guaranteed money  they want to get to know me and work with me  tell them to call me  <BRK>he later posted on twitter that he and rooney were on good term  but agreed that  we both agreed that it is time to move on  <BRK>had a great meeting with mr rooney today we discussed a lot of thing and we cleared the air on several issue  we both agreed  that it is time to move on but i ll always have appreciation and gratitude towards the  rooney family and  steelers organization   callgod  boomin pic twitter com degurchvhw<BRK>brown s agent drew rosenhaus gave more detail about the meeting  and confirmed that it s the steelers in charge of finding a trade partner for now <BRK>only    million of the four year     million extension brown signed in   wa guaranteed  the steelers still won t trade brown is a deal doesn t benefit the team  though <BRK> the other point we made  to antonio  wa that  while  we re open to shopping around the league to see what may be available in exchange for your service  by no mean are we going to make a trade or any type of move that will not be beneficial to the pittsburgh steelers organization   steelers gm kevin colbert said of the meeting   specifically  we will not be discounting you on the trade market  and we certainly will not be releasing you  all that being said  we ll take a positive approach  if someone ha a sincere interest and they want to make a move   either a significant draft pick  or a set of pick  or a significant player plus pick   and we think it will benefit the pittsburgh steelers in the long run  then we re all in  if not  then we ll make that decision at that point  <BRK>colbert when asked how deep the wound are between ab and the  steelers   i don t think any relationship is irreparable  <BRK>there s still a respectable chance brown stick around in pittsburgh  but he wa nearly packing his bag for buffalo come march  talk between the steelers and bill nearly sent the all pro wideout to western new york  but fell through after report of a deal were leaked to the world  buffalo walked away from the deal   but not after brown made his displeasure with the idea of moving to the league s  st ranked passing offense clear <BRK>steelers and bill had positive  trade talk last night  but deal fell apart because antonio brown nixed going to buffalo  per source <BRK>pittsburgh ha courted drama throughout the seaon  though much of it came a a function of le veon bell s year long holdout in hope of a lucrative long term contract  bell s absence put a strain on the rest of one of the league s most talented offense  while second year back james conner wa able to pick up much of the slack  the club still struggled early and then spun out late a a       seaon ended without a playoff berth <BRK>but while bell may have been the focus of pittsburgh s locker room drama  brown also made his issue with the franchise known throughout the season  a slow start led the all pro wideout to vent his frustration both on the field and off  he wasn t shy about expressing his concern about fichtner s playcalling to his face in a week   loss to the chief <BRK>antonio brown in fichtner s face   steelers pic twitter com diimzvl s<BRK>the following day  he d take to twitter to respond to a steelers  pr staffer s praise of ben roethlisberger and his role in the team s success  his since deleted tweet wa succinct   trade me let s find out  <BRK>both brown and his agent drew rosenhaus would deny brown wanted to be traded out of pittsburgh  but the wideout s discontent wa clear  he d skip team meeting the following monday  though those came with tomlin s blessing  he returned to practice the following wednesday after dealing with private discipline from tomlin and the rest of the pittsburgh coaching staff <BRK>despite report that brown requested to be traded after the latest dustup  that doesn t appear to be the cae  a tomlin said  <BRK>my understanding of the situation surrounding  steelers wr antonio brown  a he exited the field in frustration on wednesday  he yelled   i m done   then wondered why they don t trade him  more venting in anger than anything  he ha not made any actual trade request  officially <BRK>despite these issue  brown had a typically great season  he caught   pass for     yard and   touchdown   the   touchdown were a career high  the seven time pro bowler also passed the     yard milestone for his career  brown s   target on the season ranked third behind julio jones     and davante adam      <BRK>brown s concern about not getting the ball may have been valid  while juju smith schuster s acendance left him a the steelers  most productive receiver  brown wa still the no    target who drew double team and allowed his fellow receiver to thrive  that pasing threat also created space for conner to thrive in a breakout sophomore campaign  he ran for   yard and   touchdown in   game while serving a the pepsi to bell s coke <BRK>and brown s absence appeared to play a role in pittsburgh s sluggish start in week    the steelers faced the league s worst defense in a deficient bengal team  but managed to score just   point in the process  without brown on the field  smith schuster wa limited to just five catch and   yard   though he did score the game s only offensive touchdown  <BRK>smith schuster know that brown help him and ha said he doesn t want to see brown traded <BRK> no i don t want ab to get traded  he make me better  he make the team better  he s awesome  he s a great dude  but for myself  i learn a lot from him just playing with him  if i want to increase my game to be the best  i ve got to compete against him  so i do not want him traded  <BRK>wa that a function of cincinnati finding the extra space to double down on pittsburgh s playmaker without brown on the field  wa it due to brown s behavior affecting the rest of the team s desire to play  a one unnamed player suggested to the post gazette  or did the bengal just play a little harder with the chance to derail a rival s playoff hope on the line <BRK>no one s quite sure  but what is clear is that brown and the steelers will likely have to work through some issue if they re going to reconcile for a happy and prosperous
