it s been over a month since the los angeles lakers traded ivica zubac and michael beasley to the la clipper for mike muscala  and at the time  the moved seemed questionable at best  now  with the help of hindsight  it s clear that president of basketball operation magic johnson and general manager rob pelinka made arguably their worst trade to date <BRK>the lakers brought in muscala because of his ability to space the floor at the center position  so far  muscala ha made just five of his   total   point attempt  that s only slightly better than beasley  who shot     percent from behind the arc in   appearance for the lakers <BRK>beasley now play in china  muscala started his second game for the lakers on tuesday <BRK>the   year old big man is also posting career low in offensive rating       and defensive rating       for a team low net rating of       he s been bad  and unfortunately  his on court production isn t even the worst part of the trade <BRK>in exchange for muscala  the clipper received a   year old center in zubac  who  prior to getting traded across the hall  wa the starting center for the lakers  i repeat  the lakers traded their starting center for someone that average   minute per game for his career <BRK>if this same trade wa made over a year ago  perhaps it wouldn t have been met with such heavy criticism  but zubac wa playing some of the basketball of his career before being traded  <BRK>through   game with the lakers this season  zubac averaged     point      rebound and     block per   minute  the only player to match those average leading up to the all star break were joel embiid  anthony davis  jusuf kurkic and karl anthony town <BRK>will zubac ever play at the level of those player  probably not  but those number can t be disregarded  especially with a player a young a zubac  who won t turn   until about midway through next seaon <BRK>that same line of thinking is probably why clipper head coach doc river wa so elated   and surprised   to find out that the lakers were making zubac available in trade talk <BRK>river  response to lawrence frank when he learned the clipper could acquire ivica zubac   wake up  no way  that s not gonna happen  <BRK>the question then is  why on earth did the lakers make this trade <BRK>in february  right after making the trade  pelinka told reporter that the goal of the trade wa to  diversify  the lakers  center rotation <BRK> it wa hard to trade zu   he is a  great young player but we feel muscala can spread the floor  stretch five and play some forward a well   pelinka said   just open up the court for our driver like rondo  lebron  brandon ingram and lonzo when he come back  <BRK>the only problem with that logic   outside of the part where he said lonzo wa coming back   is that even prior to arriving in los angeles  muscala wa struggling mightily from behind the arc  shooting     percent on     attempt per game  you can t trade for a player having a bad season and expect him to thrive in an even le familiar situation  that s insane <BRK>what s more dumbfounding is that the lakers had internal option they could have explored before trading their starting center for a rotation player <BRK>in last summer s draft  the lakers used their lone first round draft pick to select moe wagner  a floor spacing  high energy big man out of the university of michigan  during wagner s introductory press conference  johnson said he expected the   year old to come in and make an immediate impact <BRK> i better not speak for coach walton  he handle the playing time and all of that     but i selected  the rookie  to play   johnson said <BRK>in   appearance this season  wagner is averaging     minute per game <BRK>one could argue that wagner wan t and still isn t ready to see regular rotation minute  but it wan t even an avenue they explored before making zubac available  that s a problem  and  a it turn out  the difference in production between wagner and muscala is marginal <BRK>then  there s the rumor that the lakers traded zubac because they felt they couldn t afford him  a reported by brad turner of the los angeles time in february  the only problem with that theory is that zubac s salary wa always a non issue <BRK>zubac will hit restricted free agency this summer with a cap hold of      million  even with zubac s cap hold  the lakers would have still been able to sign kawhi leonard  kyrie irving or klay thompson to a max contract starting at      million <BRK>with the roughly    million in cap space they would have left over  they could have filled out their bench and then gone over the cap to sign zubac to a new deal because they would have had his full bird right  now the clipper  who will be doing star chasing of their own this summer  will have that luxury <BRK>the only scenario in which zubac s restricted free agency status would have been an issue for the lakers in their pursuit of a second star would have been if another team made him a lucrative offer  which would have tied up l a  s cap space temporarily  in the unlikely event that happened within the first few day of free agency  the lakers could have simply renounced him and it would have had the same affect a trading him did <BRK>crazy  i know <BRK>if the lakers sign a superstar free agent this summer and that extra    million they saved is used to sign a quality free agent  maybe this trade will all be an afterthought  but this unnecessary sense of urgency to solve problem that don t exist yet is what cost the lakers d angelo russell in    and julius randle last summer <BRK>the front office can make all the signing and trade they want  but until they learn from their mistake  this organization is going to be where it been for the past
