it really seemed like jeff blashill had been cruising along under the radar  the all cap call for his firing have been dwindling since the red wing recovered from the brutal beginning of the season and have been kind of fun to watch  <BRK> still painful  but kinda fun  like reluctantly chuckling at your own misfortune after you trip up the stair and then fumble your key and then drop your grocery and then bump into the corner of solid furniture and break your  th favorite glass  <BRK> that kind of fun  <BRK> some potential reason why the fanbase ha tapped the brake   <BRK> dylan larkin is a religious experience  gustav nyquist is the perfect wingman  james tiberius howard continues to james tiberius howard  niklas kronwall is going out in a blaze of vintage kronwall glory  the battle to be crowned king of almosts between luke glendening  darren helm  and justin abdelkader continues  there are all kind of thing to latch onto in an otherwise dismal season  <BRK> come home stevie  a large chunk of the fanbae is ready to hunker down and wait for stevie to come home and clean house  the clock is ticking a our older kid are getting closer and closer to their prime and the defense and goaltending is still a big problem but how can you not believe in the power of steve yzerman and his glases  <BRK> no shame in tuning out  if someone is a fair weather fan  let them be  at least they re admitting it  probably weird for their family to see the goblin like creature that usually can be heard screeching at a glowing screen acting like a proper human  <BRK> lose for hughes  etc  no further explanation required  <BRK> that brings u to present day   <BRK> in general  there s nothing wrong with having a player enjoy the view from the press box when they ve been unperforming  watching the game from a different angle  having a day or two to hit the reset button and come back ready to beat down any challenger for their roster spot  this is a strategy that ha worked out positively many time  <BRK> but then there s jeff blashill s version of the red wing way    <BRK> we ve seen it with mantha  we ve seen it with athanasiou  rasmussen hasn t gotten the full effect  but he will  zadina definitely will  benchings of young player that seem le constructive and more of a public shaming  <BRK> sometimes the healthy scratch strategy doe have guy coming back burning up the world   see exhibit aa  maybe blash s approach is to make his player perform well to personally spite him   <BRK> and when i say  player   i mean  player under the age of      <BRK> if that s the case  go ahead and pencil in dennis cholowski for the norris trophy  <BRK> it wa supposed to be a homecoming  it wa supposed to be a rookie s first chance to play in front of his family and friend  remember when anthony  spare part  mantha scored his first goal at the joe against his hometown habs with all his friend and family watching  iconic  <BRK> what could be more motivating for a player than knowing your family and friend are in the building to see firsthand all the year of hard work and sacrifice pay off  and it s vancouver  not exactly driving distance from detroit  it s a once in a season chance  <BRK> according to jeff blashill  what s even more motivating than all that is being a healthy scratch   <BRK> we ve all run the gambit from grumbling to ranting in reaction to jeff blashill s seemingly unorthodox player nurturing method  did he cross the line with the benching of cholowski in vancouver  <BRK> it feel petty   <BRK> it feel cruel   <BRK> it s a moment cholowski and his family will never have back  <BRK> and for what  <BRK> the stake have never been lower for the wing to skate away with two point  we re heading into the all star break in a position where we should be signaling the carpathia for rescue  if the wing can lose while having tried their best  that s a win win situation all around   <BRK> whether or not cholowski wa slumping enough to deserve to be benched is irrelevant  in fact  i agree that cholowski ha been making some costly error  but tough to argue he s the worst of the bunch  i don t even want to hear finger touching key if it s going to be a     stat reference  <BRK> in any case  blashill said the only reason he hadn t benched him yet is becaue we were out of healthy defensemen  enter danny dekeyser who  gord help u all  actually had a pretty good first game back in calgary  <BRK> it is utterly baffling  how could blash have done anything but wait one more game  he couldn t let a kid who came out of nowhere and slotted into a lineup that heavily favor ancient relic have his moment  again  how could anything be considered a slump breaker more than having your family in the crowd  <BRK> sure made the fsd plan a bit awkward with what they had already filmed  <BRK> seriously  did cholowski steal blash s lunch out of the fridge  kick his dog  make fun of the blashspot  fill his car with peep  go back in time and dump his book in front of the girl he liked  <BRK> no matter what standard bland explanation may come out   if someone ha the audacity to confront him with a question about it   nothing short of cholowski actually being unhealthy seems like it will justify this action  <BRK> i predict nothing change and i suspect most of you feel the same   whether we want to or not  <BRK> i place myself in the category of being too distracted by shiny object and the memeability of jeff blashill to have had strong feeling about him getting the boot  figured i d ramp back up when it came time to get a new contract  now i m getting swept back into it on the fresh wave of anger that s rolling through the fanbase   <BRK> maybe i ll go back to the chill state of waiting it out  but i m not sure this is a forgivable offense  i hope i m proven wrong and cholowski wa hit by a meteor or had the plague or some other reasonable explanation  <BRK> but right now  <BRK> i m ready for dan bylsma to take over  <BRK> how about you   <BRK> 
        detroit area event happening soon
