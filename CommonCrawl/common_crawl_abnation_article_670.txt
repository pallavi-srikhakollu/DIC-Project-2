the indiana pacer weren t supposed to be relevant last season  they weren t supposed to have an all star  let alone get the last laugh after they were panned for trading paul george for victor oladipo and domantas sabonis  they definitely weren t supposed to contend for home court advantage or make lebron james sweat it out in the first round   <BRK> that s why there wa an underlying sense of frailty to their success  a if it wa a happy accident that would be unmaked a a fluke  <BRK> prognosticator had their reason  sport illustrated wa skeptical that oladipo s sensational season would be his new normal  indy cornrows  sb nation s pacer blog  noted that starting point guard darren collison wa unlikely to flirt with the       club again  espn s preseason power ranking repeated a common critique that they relied too much on unsustainably hot mid range shooting  analytics site nylon calculus suggested their     record in game decided by three point or le wa a product of luck  <BRK> more from caitlin cooper <BRK> caitlin cooper writes about the indiana pacer for sb nation s pacer site indy cornrows  with a special focus on x and o  here are   of her story worth checking out  <BRK> turn out  they were all right  oladipo ha experienced growing pain adapting to increaed defensive attention  the pacer aren t draining open two pointer at the same clip a they did in      collison s number are down after he missed   of his first   attempt from three  while there have been some memorable late game heroic from oladipo  indiana ha already dropped a many game decided by three point or le a they did all of lat seaon  <BRK> yet the pacer have somehow improved despite all that  they re on pace to win   game and currently have the fourth best record in the nba  all without changing their identity or adding elite talent   <BRK> so how is pacer  seemingly outdated style competing with superteam giant   again  <BRK> last year  indiana wa heavily dependent on it new star  they outscored team by six point per   possession with oladipo on the floor and were outscored by     point per   possession with him on the bench  that should have forecasted doom when oladipo went down with a bone bruise in his knee in mid november  <BRK> instead  something shocking happened to the team s supporting cast  not only did the pacer go      a vast improvement over last season s     mark with oladipo sidelined  but they also unlocked some previously underused area of help in his absence  <BRK> oladipo s injury allowed forced young center myles turner to emerge from the background  and he s backed it up by averaging a career high in touch per game        point        rebound        block        and field goal percentage       since oladipo went down on nov     on a smaller scale  indiana made a more purposeful effort to use free agent signing doug mcdermott s floor spacing  which led to back to back   point game off the bench  collison rediscovered his shot  canning   percent on his last   three  <BRK> all that happened a the rest of the roster kept on chugging  sabonis  a per minute wunderkind leading the sixth man of the year race  continued using his   foot      pound frame to play like a guard a well a a big  small forward bojan bogdanovic is shooting   percent from three and ha grown more comfortable putting the ball on the floor and attacking from a variety of depth  power forward thaddeus young put on a role player clinic in key win over milwaukee and philadelphia  leading to him being awarded eatern conference player of the week  backup point guard cory joseph continues to make a big impact doing the little thing  even with his usage and minute down   <BRK> halfway through the season  indiana ha logged   game with at least six player scoring in double figure  they had only   such game all of last year  <BRK> those change sustained themselves the lat few week a oladipo ha searched for balance between aserting himself and deferring  the pacer have won   of their lat   game since oladipo returned to the lineup  responding equally well when oladipo saw drop coverage  aggressive hedge  and even box and one zone defense   <BRK> in a league increasingly geared toward offense  indiana make their mark on the le glamorous end of the floor  allowing the second fewest point per   possession in the league  <BRK> the pacer do have a lot of individual defensive talent  turner is blocking every shot in sight and ha become an elite anchor  one the pacer badly missed during his injury  young put the clamp on elite scorer at the league s most important position  joseph is a pest at the point of attack  and oladipo us his speed to buzz here  there  and everywhere off the ball like a hummingbird in search of nectar  <BRK> but there s also something to be said for the palpable trust that pulsates through their system and mask the flaw of weaker link  their defensive rotation have a mesmerizing quality  akin to the gorgeous ball movement of the san antonio spur from season past  <BRK> this defensive possession from indiana wa just perfect pic twitter com sobb a mtf <BRK> that s why they re able to be miserly with lineup that seem like they should be a defensive liability  team rarely play two center anymore because they re vulnerable to getting beat off the dribble by quick guard  but the pacer have held opponent to just     point per   possession in the   minute that turner and sabonis have shared the floor  a figure considerably stingier than the team s already stingy defensive rating        that speaks to the strength of their help coverage  <BRK> check out this possession against the lakers  when joseph got switched onto lakers forward kyle kuzma  rather than stranding the   foot   guard on an island  the pacer responded with a fluid chain of sinking and filling that disrupted the drop off pas and took away the shortest possible kick out  <BRK> the biggest takeaway  neither sabonis nor turner wa ever put in the position to get blown by on a closeout   <BRK> better yet  they don t just use this connectivity to play prevent defense  a they lead the eatern conference in steal  forced turnover  and point off turnover  when energized and active  which is baically their default  the pacer are killing possession on one end of the floor and converting them into eay look in transition on the other  that help mak their offensive weakness  they re     when they outscore their opponent in point off turnover  yet only finished with the edge in three point margin in five of those   win  <BRK> playing really freaking hard is a huge part of it  look at everything that happened on this possession  <BRK> that series of hustle play is like a movie trailer for the full on pacer experience   <BRK> true to form  indiana won that game by   point despite made four fewer three that the piston  forcing   turnover for   point go a long way   <BRK> the pacer  offensive philosophy borrows from br er rabbit s strategy to evade capture in the steep drop scene on walt disney world s splash mountain attraction  upon being snared by his foe  br er rabbit begs not to get thrown in the briar patch  his pursuer do exactly that  only for br er rabbit to triumphantly emerge unscathed and declare that he  wa born and raised in the briar patch   <BRK> indiana us that same reverse psychology on it opponent  it may seem contrary to modern shot trend for the pacer to be taking     percent of their shot a long two  third highest in the league  instead of getting more three up  they re fifth highest in three point percentage  but only  th in attempt   but there is something to be said for aggressively pursuing the shot that defense tend not to guard closely  <BRK> consider this possession from indiana s first meeting with boston  the celtic have ranked in the top five in opponent   point percentage in each of the lat   seaon  so rather than pursuing more three  which the celtic are well equipped to contest  the pacer made an already uncontested mid range shot more open by using the   point line a a distraction   <BRK> kyrie irving wa so preoccupied with the dummy off ball screen between indiana s top two scorer that he literally turned his back to turner  who sunk the wide open   footer  <BRK> indiana find way to overcome the math disadvantage they surrender  the pacer ended up winning that game by one point because they outscored the celtic by   combined point on two and free throw  which made up for getting housed by   from three  when the pacer snapped brooklyn s seven game winning streak on dec     they did so despite getting outscored by   point from three and nine at the free throw line  how did they win by eight  by limiting the net to   fewer field goal attempt and shooting a blistering   percent from two point range   <BRK> this isn t how most team win  but that s how they do  <BRK> thriving while overcoming le efficient shot selection may also give indiana an advantage in the postseason  though indiana ha the  th most efficient half court offense among current playoff team  according to synergy sport  they are well equipped to throw tough defense off because they re not used to defending team that play this way   <BRK> defying convention  playing outside the box  refusing to conform  whatever you choose to call it  the pacer are winning with their brand of basketball  they re not a fluke  and it s long past time to take them seriously   <BRK>  <BRK>
