boston    blake griffin wa posted up in the paint  which wa patently unfair for whoever wa trying to guard him  griffin s too big for guard who get switched on to him  even someone like marcus smart who life for these kind of confrontation  he s too quick for bulky forward like semi ojeleye  and maybe even just a strong  <BRK>griffin could always do damage down low  during his glory day with the clipper  the power forward wa known for dunking on people and going to work on the block with his startling combination of speed  quickness  and strength  <BRK>his mid range face up game wa always solid and so wa his passing  two underrated skill that tended to get lost in all the highlight  the day of blake being just a dunker are long gone  or should have been for anyone paying attention  <BRK>few people are paying that much attention to griffin now that he toil in relative obscurity for the relentlessly mediocre piston  but perhaps we should  historically  we ve been told that player reach their peak sometime between age      but griffin is enjoying a career season just a few week shy of his  th birthday   <BRK>in addition to good health  what s changed this season is that griffin ha traded those   foot mid range jumper for more efficient three point attempt  he s shooting a career best   percent from   point range on a career high     attempt  mixing that newfound range with all the other element of his game have once again made griffin one of the best forward in the league  <BRK> his skillset ha expanded   piston coach dwane casey said   now he s more of a point power forward  if there s such a term in the new nba  shooting the    running the pick and roll  he s expanded his game to another level  he s carried a heavy load for u this year   <BRK>a very heavy load  griffin s usage rate ha topped   percent for the first time in his career  that s in line with what lebron james and kevin durant do for their team  and the talent starved piston need every bit of his production just to hang on the periphery of the playoff chae in the east  <BRK>griffin s become a great player on a mediocre team  which would sound like damning him with faint praise if he wasn t also undergoing a career renaissance  he s an all star for the first time in four year and a strong contender for an all nba berth  <BRK>the all star part isn t that surprising   he doe play in the eat  after all   but griffin s all nba day were supposed to be behind him  once draymond green arrived on the scene and began putting traditional four out of business  blake s day a an elite player in this weird new nba seemed to belong to a distant age  <BRK>the irony is that griffin needed to move to from the bright light of los angeles to the obscurity of a sub    team to finally be appreciated for his all around game  but there s a deeper message here  beyond the vagary of the nba transaction wire  rather than accept his fate and allow his career to stagnate toward well paying obsolescence  griffin adapted to meet the new job requirement for a star nba forward  <BRK>after taking the piston job last summer  casey flew out to meet griffin and wa startled to find him working out with a crew of player who were putting him through all manner of perimeter situation  handling the ball  shooting   s  swinging pass  and kicking out to shooter  <BRK> i wa like  whoa   casey recall   he wa doing everything with shot spectrum understanding value and efficiency of shot  <BRK>griffin s offseaon work could be a cae study for what the psychologist anders ericsson termed   deliberate practice   training that emphaizes evolutionary growth over repetition and refinement  a ericsson and his co author robert pool wrote in their book  peak <BRK>the brain is adaptable and training can create new skill that did not exist before  learning isn t a way of reaching one s potential  but rather a way of developing it  we can create our own potential  <BRK>that s a powerful thought in a league where we rush to cap potential and lock player into a preconceived set of belief  in los angeles  griffin wa part of a star crossed ensemble that never got over it postseason hurdle  in detroit  he s being asked to provide a foundation for a rebuilding team  <BRK>how doe one go from being a key member of a team that wasn t good enough to a franchise player on a mediocre one  by keeping an open mind  <BRK>throughout his long coaching career  casey ha worked with some of the best forward in the world  dirk nowitzki in dallas  kevin garnett in minnesota  even all the way back to detlef schrempf in seattle  he considers griffin to be right there with all of them  <BRK>i asked casey if griffin is the kind of player you can build a franchise around and he didn t hesitate   yes  you can   casey said   no question  you sure can  that s what we re slowly doing  we re adding the type of player that fit the culture and also fit today s nba   <BRK>cap strapped and short of asset  the piston may be year away from completing a total overhaul that will fully take advantage of griffin s talent  one only hope there s still time for him to reap the benefit of his mid career resurgence  <BRK>griffin s re emergence brings to mind another mid career revival taking place in oklahoma where paul george ha become a top   mvp candidate and the frontrunner for defensive player of the year  even for the most zealous george defender  his performance ha surpassed all previous expectation  <BRK>consider that george is also a strong bet to land on the all nba first team  that would be no small accomplishment  given that with giannis antetokounmpo locked into one of the two forward spot  voter would have to conclude that pg had a better season than both lebron james and kevin durant  which he ha  <BRK>george is posting career best mark in scoring  rebounding  steal  and assist  while shooting at a much higher level of efficiency than ever before  like griffin  pg ha transformed himself from a star performer into an elite one  and like griffin  his career year ha redefined a player once consigned to second tier star status  <BRK>on his way out the door from indiana to oklahoma city  the prevailing wisdom wa that a good a he wa  george simply wan t a no    guy  it s true that george doesn t have to carry the thunder on his own with russell westbrook and steven adam around  yet  by emerging a the best player on a contending team  he s recat himself a a legitimate mvp contender   <BRK>a with griffin  george didn t just work on his game this summer  he evolved to meet the demand of his work environment  given a seaon to learn about playing with westbrook  george dropped some of his muscle mas and became sleeker and fater  always one of the smoothest player in the game  george ha found his flow amid the turbulence of westbrook s jet stream  <BRK> when he got traded  i think it wa an eye opening experience of playing with russell  how fast he is   okc coach billy donovan said   i give him a lot of credit to absorb all those experience and then make the decision that were the right decision of where he needed to grow and get better and be more effective   <BRK>george s breakout seaon ha been all the more enjoyable given the thunder s standing a one of the top team in the league  while playing with someone a dynamic a westbrook ha been a boon for george  bringing out the best of pg ha engendered a deeper appreciation for westbrook s leadership ability  <BRK>all of which is to say that we do player a disservice by locking them into a box  change their circumstance  give them good health  proper motivation coupled with a willingness to evolve that allows them to be who they are  and there s no telling what a player may achieve  potential  after all  is what we make of it  blake griffin and paul george are still making the most of theirs  <BRK>in addition owning the best record in the league at the break  the milwaukee buck also have the highest net rating  scoring     point more than their opponent per   possession  net rating is a useful regular season metric  but it han t been all that predictive in the playoff  just three team in the last decade who finished with the top net rating went on to win the championship  still  milwaukee s regular season work ha clearly put them ahead of the crowded pack of contender in the east <BRK>the only player in baketball reference s databae to post a higher usage rate than james harden s     is rusell westbrook during rus s triple double fueled mvp seaon  while everyone keep looking for sign of fatigue and regression  harden keep dropping   point game on defense designed to limit his effectiveness  just a westbrook s one man statistical asault defined the     seaon of the solo superstar  so ha harden s offensive barrage come to encapsulate this campaign  in a year in which offense rule  harden ha stretched them to their logical mean <BRK>the nugget have lost only four time at home and three of those came on consecutive night way back in november  since then  denver ha run off a     home record with the only loss coming at the hand of the warrior in a   point beatdown  the upstart nugget enter the all star break sandwiched between the warrior and thunder in second place in the west and securing a top two seed is a regular seaon goal worth pursuing  everyone like being at home for the playoff  but few team need that comfort a much a the inexperienced nugget who have been a break even proposition on the road  <BRK>the pelican have   home date left this season  and it would be a shock if anthony davis suited up for all of them  the situation reached yet another crisis point on thursday when camera showed him leaving the arena early with his agent rich paul while the undermanned pel pulled off a win over oklahoma city  that ultimately cost general manager dell demps his job  which wa only a matter of time anyway  demps and the pelican failed davis during his tenure  but one wonder if ad would have handled his exit differently if he had known the fallout would be this severe <BRK>in a subtle twist introduced this seaon  the nba ha removed a bit of tanking incentive by leveling the odds for the three worst team during the regular seaon  a it stand  the knicks would have a     percent chance of securing the top pick  followed by the sun    percent  and then cleveland        heck  the hawk who are slotted fifth would still have a     percent chance of winning the lottery  that should help alleviate some of the more egregious tanking spectacle down the stretch  not that any of those team are in danger of winning too many game of their own volition <BRK> i ve been blessed with the talent to not give a f k   <BRK>thunder guard russell westbrook on his critic  <BRK>reaction  if this quote wa a bumper sticker i d put in on my car  <BRK> what s harder from a player standpoint  six championship  always  <BRK> hornet owner michael jordan  <BRK>reaction  michael jordan didn t invent pettiness in this league  he made it into an art form  he wear those six ring like a warning sign to anyone who dare challenge his prominence  speaking of that     <BRK> ain t no maybe about it  i m going to do that s t  <BRK> lebron james to the athletic s joe vardon on owning a team someday  <BRK>reaction  a thing that people miss when sizing up the lebron jordan debate is that james seems intent on pasing jordan s impact in every apect  from his investment portfolio  to his charitable work  and now apparently  a path to franchise ownership  you can argue about their on court merit all you want  but the off court stuff is just a significant  if not more  to understanding lebron s ambition  <BRK> quit making this about thinking these guy are baby  because that s what you re treating them like  they re professional  all of them  and this is how this league work  they know it  i know it  that s how it go  <BRK> laker team president magic johnson <BRK>reaction  you know  magic ha a point  you re nobody in this league until you ve had your name dragged through the rumor mill  not to put too fine a point on it  but the rumor mill is what drive interest in the league  <BRK> they are on my list   <BRK>anthony davis on the celtic  who are not on a list of preferred destination but are on a list of   other team  or something  <BRK>reaction  starting to think this ha not been not the most well coordinated campaign  <BRK>
