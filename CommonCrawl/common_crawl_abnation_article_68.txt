 just why  aren t we taking a stand   asked deja vu  a host on new york r b station wbls  last monday evening  she and dj enuff were discussing the previous day s super bowl halftime show announcement  travis scott and big boi will officially join maroon   on the country s biggest stage  at wbls  rapper big boi s participation wa the primary point of concern   although i feel like a hypocrite  because you know i m gonna be having a super bowl party   she continued   that s the problem   said enuff   we re torn  <BRK>that announcement came belatedly  in large part thanks to simmering resentment of the nfl among a number of entertainment industry heavyweight  <BRK>many celebrity in music  film and beyond supported colin kaepernick s protest against police brutality and systemic injustice early on   but the saga that s unfolded since ha made ignoring the nfl s political heft nearly impossible  colin kaepernick used his platform to insist that america s institution need to value and protect black life just a they do white one   and the league han t employed him since  <BRK>if there are two america  a the social medium fueled shorthand suggests  that reality ha made it obvious which one the nfl will take a stand for   and it s not the same one that includes either the vat majority of it player or many popular musician  so once kaepernick s unemployment became nearly impossible to explain credibly without using the word  blackball   those artist found the one place where they could exert their influence on his behalf inside the monolithic nfl  the super bowl halftime show  a a result  what used to be one of music s biggest honor   a sign of reaching a transcendent level of stardom   ha become the league s largest remaining platform for dissent   <BRK>star from jay z to rihanna to cardi b refused music s most coveted invitation and explicitly cited kaepernick s unemployment a the reaon  fueling the public s growing dissatisfaction with the way the league ha handled kaepernick s protest  currently  the   boycottnfl  hahtag is almost exclusively attached to post declaring their support of the quarterback and activist   not those expressing their anger at player who have continued his protest  <BRK>week went by  and still there wa no confirmed performer  in contrast  lady gaga s halftime set wa confirmed by the league on sept       and timberlake s on oct        <BRK>rumor about maroon   headlining started in september but instead of confirming and promoting the show  the league stayed quiet  in response  vic oyedeji started a change org petition to get the band to drop out of the show that eventually garnered     signature  that delay wa already unprecedented  at leat a long a the super bowl halftime show ha featured megatars and not marching band  though super bowl performer don t get paid   expense and production cost are covered   it s by far the largest available platform to promote new music or an upcoming tour  gaga and timberlake  for example  both timed new album releaes to coincide with their performance  more broadly  the halftime show ha long been a way to cement your status in a clas of music icon  michael jackson  prince  beyonce  and now    maroon   <BRK>one reaon for the delayed announcement wa the need to flesh out the supporting cat   the lat band to perform at the halftime show wa coldplay  who were joined by bruno mar and beyonce  in what  by any account  wa a scene stealing turn in which she held up a fist surrounded by woman dressed a member of the black panther party   also troubling wa the fact that the super bowl wa taking place in what s arguably hip hop s current capital  atlanta  and yet the band wa struggling to find a local act to join them  in late november  adam levine commented on the report about maroon   s super bowl booking to variety  saying only   i m still formulating a lot of thing   <BRK>the real backlash  though  started with report that travis scott would be among the band s guest  immediately  jay z  meek mill  and even the rev  al sharpton took the rapper to task  <BRK> i think anyone that go into the halftime show is in effect directly violating those that want to raise the question that the nfl should come to term with what they have done and continue to do to colin kaepernick and those that protest on criminal justice issue   sharpton told tmz   i think he should do what a lot of other major artist have done   say   i m not going to participate   you can t fight against jim crow and then go sit in the back of the bus  <BRK> hopefully  it s not true   said actor michael b  jordan of the scott rumor  also to tmz   we are trying to stand behind something right now  it s like  we all have to collectively try to do that  <BRK>at that point  it became abundantly obvious that for any artist  performing at the super bowl halftime show would be a much of a liability a it might be a boon for their career  it s a somewhat surprising twist  too  given that those who heard the nfl s death knell when kaepernick s protest wa at it zenith have largely been quiet a rating rebounded  from a dip that wa probably more tied to changing technology than anything that happened during the anthem  and conversation around social justice and cte hit a lull  <BRK>while protest against police brutality and systemic injustice had been all but stifled on the gridiron itself   eric reid and kenny still continued to kneel through the last regular season game of the   season   a line had been drawn in the sand  believing that kaepernick s protest wa brave and important wa in direct conflict with participating in the nfl s annual spectacle  <BRK>in the wake of sunday s official lineup confirmation  the conversation around the halftime show ha exploded  and likely not in the way the nfl and pepsi would prefer   it s moronic on the one hand that  maroon    are even doing it   an unnamed publicist told billboard   it s not the biggest gig of your career when more than   percent of the world hate you for making the choice  i think it hurt their brand and it s a total mistake on their part   maroon    big boi and travis scott are all affiliated with full stop management  which is in turn affiliated with irving azoff   one of the single most powerful manager in music <BRK>scott attempted to buffer himself against criticism by  partnering  with the nfl to donate      to van jones  non profit dream corp  whose social justice oriented mission recently wa spotlighted in legislation enacted by president donald trump   i back anyone who take a stand for what they believe in   scott said in a statement   i know being an artist that it s in my power to inspire  so before confirming the super bowl halftime performance  i made sure to partner with the nfl on this important donation   on january  h  variety reported that scott and kaepernick had spoken before scott agreed to perform and  while the two did not necessarily agree  they emerged from the conversation with mutual respect and understanding  <BRK>kaepernick s longtime girlfriend  nessa diab  is a host on hot    in response to the scott news  she tweeted   there is no mutual respect and there is no understanding for anyone working against  kaepernick  period   stoplying    which kaepernick retweeted  ebro darden  who host hot   s morning show  added   kap did not approve this bullshit  get the fuck outta here        also retweeted by kaepernick  oyedeji updated his petition to ask that the artist performing at halftime take a knee in protest during their set  the response wa unequivocal  and illustrates just how important a battleground the super bowl ha become for musician debating whether or not to take advantage of it massive reach  <BRK>when gladys knight  an atlanta native  announced that she would be performing the national anthem at the super bowl  she felt compelled to address kaepernick specifically   i understand that mr  kaepernick is protesting two thing  and they are police violence and injustice   she told variety in a statement   it is unfortunate that our national anthem ha been dragged into this debate when the distinctive sens of the national anthem and fighting for justice should each stand alone  <BRK>but for kaepernick and those who stand with him  any participation look like an untenable compromise  and scott s donation like quid pro quo  one of kaepernick s most recent retweets make that line of thinking explicit     k to dream corp for travis scott to strike a deal and walk past the cardi b rihanna others protest line   tweeted an account with the handle  rzstprogramming   in    the nfl also committed cash to dream corp in the player coalition deal brokered by malcolm jenkins  dream corp now in two nfl  paidtonotprotest scheme   <BRK>it s clear that a metaphorical picket line ha been drawn   and gladys knight  maroon    big boi and travis scott have crossed it <BRK>
