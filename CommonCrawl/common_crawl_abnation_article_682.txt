pro basketball scout packed the glen fall civic center in march   to watch harlem s rice high school take on brooklyn s lincoln high in the new york state class aa tournament of champion  the spotlight wa on curtis kelly  a highly touted rice senior on his way to uconn <BRK>one of those scout approached rice coach mo hick and told him he had a pro basketball player on his roster <BRK> yeah  curtis can be good   hick remembers saying   he just ha to keep working  he can be really special  <BRK> no  i m not talking about curtis   hick recall the scout responding   i m talking about no     that sophomore kid you brought off the bench  that kid is gonna be a pro  <BRK>that no    wa kemba walker  when walker entered rice a year earlier  he wan t even considered the best player in his freshman class  back then  there wa more buzz about curtis loving  a     forward who went on to play at bridgeport  and chris fouch  another rice guard who went to drexel before playing overseas <BRK>how kemba walker became an nba star<BRK>tracking kemba s rise through some past sb nation story <BRK> he wa so humble to a fault that he wouldn t challenge those guy like we wanted him to   hick say   we saw that he could  but he wa such a humble kid that he wa basically trying to pay homage to those guy  <BRK>slowly  that changed  a a high school junior  walker made the all tournament team  a a senior  he grew into a first team all state performer and a five star recruit  that gradual rise repeated itself in college  then early in his pro career  and again a he s become a three time nba all star  set to start the game for the first time this weekend in charlotte  <BRK>those that know him best  from his high school and college coach to the many player who have shared the floor with him  say he s still like the high school freshman who wa the last to realize he wa a star and the first to support those who helped him get there <BRK> it s amazing to see   hick say   all the thing he s done  he s still that same humble kid a when he walked into rice high school  <BRK>they also say walker will do anything to win  it mean more to him than money  than individual fame  than any award  <BRK> that s not what i m about  all i m about is winning   walker tell me    the money  will come  i put my work in throughout my career to become the player i am today  it s never about the money  i want to win  <BRK>against this backdrop  walker is speeding toward the biggest professional decision of his life  he will become an unrestricted free agent on july    giving him the freedom to choose his team with no restriction for the first time in his pro career  <BRK>charlotte ha given him the platform and tool for individual success  but little winning  since drafting walker in    the franchise ha made five trip to the draft lottery and won zero playoff series  which ll likely continue this year if the hornet even make it that far  worse  the hornet  payroll is clogged  with five of walker s teammate combining to make nearly   percent of the salary cap next season despite zero all star appearance between them  <BRK> we just gotta build a winning franchise  man  we just need some winner   walker say moment before boarding a flight to san antonio   we need a few guy that know what it take to win in this league  i know some guy out there that know what it take  <BRK>that mean walker is at a crossroad  doe he choose the harder  le certain path with the franchise that nurtured him  or take a step out of his comfort zone and win elsewhere <BRK>before walker became a march madness folk hero  he wa jim calhoun s backup plan <BRK>the legendary uconn coach remembers originally receiving a commitment from oak hill academy s brandon jennings  who wa the top point guard in the class  when calhoun found out jennings went to visit another college behind his back  he immediately took a trip to harlem <BRK> don t worry about brandon   he recall telling an assistant   we re gonna get the little guy from rice  <BRK>in his thick new england accent  calhoun began his sale pitch  touting a program that had won two ncaa title in the previous decade  but walker stopped him midway  he didn t need to hear much <BRK> i wanted to go somewhere and grow a a player  grow a a man   he say   he wa the one who wa able to do that for me  <BRK>a a freshman  walker backed up a j  price  a fellow new yorker who taught walker his patented stepback before carving out a six year nba career of his own  walker averaged nine point per game off the bench for a team that made the final four  in their matchup against michigan state  walker finished with five point  four turnover  and four foul in   minute  <BRK>a price declared for the nba draft  walker got to work  <BRK> i watched him work on nothing but three   calhoun recall  a   percent three point shooter a a freshman became a   percent shooter the next year  <BRK>connecticut missed the ncaa tournament that year  but calhoun saw something click before walker s junior season <BRK>  kemba  started realizing all that he needed to be to be like a j  and lead u to a final four   calhoun say   it wa never forced on him  and he never forced it on anybody  <BRK>with seven freshman on uconn s roster in the     season   including future nba player jeremy lamb and shabazz napier   the husky weren t even listed in the top   of any preseason poll  by christmas  uconn wa     and the no    ranked team in the nation <BRK>napier vividly remembers one practice where the second team wa up       over walker and the first team in a game to    with a win in sight  freshman roscoe smith said something to walker  the second team never scored again <BRK> we all looked at each other like   what the hell just happened     napier remembers   we knew how dominant he wa in game  but we didn t realize how dominant he wa in practice because he wa always trying to get other people involved  <BRK>even with walker averaging     point per game that season  uconn arrived at the big east tournament with a     record and a two game losing streak  they had work to do in order to make the ncaa tournament again  that s when walker went on a rampage few at that level have ever seen <BRK>first  he led the husky to the big east tournament title  in that five win in five day run  he used a nasty step back that immortalized the nickname  cardiac kemba   then  he eliminated kawhi leonard s san diego state team from the ncaa tournament with a   point barrage  on his way to a championship and a no brainer most outstanding player award  <BRK> he s a smiling assassin   calhoun say   an incredible  good person who ll kill you for a win  <BRK>on the night of the   nba draft  walker ha no idea where he stood  his tournament heroic had faded  and others flew past him on draft board <BRK>kyrie irving  who played just   game in his lone college season  is announced first  then  it s derrick williams  then ene kanter  who didn t play in college at all  tristan thompson  jonas valanciunas  jan vesely  too  bismack biyombo  brandon knight <BRK> i had no idea where i wa going   walker say now   my agent didn t even have an idea where i wa going at the time  he wa showing me rumor  it wa crazy  i didn t know if i wa gonna go ninth  if i wa gonna go  th  or late first round  i just didn t know  <BRK>the charlotte bobcat called  walker had worked out for them pre draft  and they were le than enthralled with his  crooked  jump shot  they chose to take him at pick no    anyway <BRK> these are the dude and the organization that believed in me  that gave me the opportunity   walker say   and this is where i ve been for eight year now  so of course i m gonna love this place  of course i m gonna be loyal  i m a loyal guy  for a long a i m here  i m gonna give this organization everything i have  <BRK>since then  walker endured the lowest winning percentage in nba history and slowly emerged a an nba starter  then a good nba starter  then an nba all star  and now an nba all star game starter  this seaon  he became one of   player in nba history to score at leat   point in a game  then  he became the first to follow a   point game with a   point game since kobe bryant did it twice in   <BRK> i never knew kemba walker wa this good   hornet rookie mile bridge said after walker rattled off   point in the fourth quarter and overtime alone in a november game against philadelphia   i knew he wa a star in this league  but damn  he s easily the best player i ve ever played with  <BRK>bridge is not the first person to not immediately recognize walker s stardom  at this point  even walker himself can t deny it <BRK> it s crazy   walker say   i go on like these streak where i can t miss  it s surreal   then  he catch himself   but i put the work in to get to the level that i m at  <BRK>jeremy lamb had just been traded  and then he got lost  just day after the oklahoma city thunder shipped him to the hornet in june    lamb could not find the charlotte douglas international airport  <BRK>walker told him to stay put  shortly after  walker s car pulled up where his former uconn teammate wa waiting and led him to the airport  <BRK> even though he s a great player  he s a better person   lamb say   he care about his teammate  he help me in any way  whatever it is  he s there to talk to  and it s not just me  he s like that with all his teammate  <BRK>this is the selfless walker most of his peer know  <BRK> man  he s a down to earth guy   napier say   he just want to see everyone do well  <BRK> he s not your typical superstar   current teammate marvin williams say  echoing napier   he s a very down to earth guy  <BRK>but though walker may not see himself this way  he s also a star with a rare opportunity to dictate his future at the peak of his power  at his core  walker feel he owes the hornet for taking a chance on him and helping him develop into a three time all star <BRK> the people around here  the organization  the fan  regardless of what we went through  they believed in me   walker exclaims   they believed in me even when i wa shooting   percent from three or   percent from the field  <BRK>but a charlotte continues to float in mediocrity  that belief seems destined to compete against his burning desire to win  in a phone conversation in mid january  i ak walker if he d like charlotte management to pursue other all star caliber player   for sure   he say   a lot of player have  all star teammate    <BRK>week later  walker s wish were nearly answered when the hornet closed in on trading for veteran three time all star center marc gaol  at the lat minute  talk stalled a the hornet and grizzly haggled over way to match gaol s      million salary  memphis eventually chose to deal gaol to toronto minute before the trade deadline  leaving charlotte empty handed <BRK>hick is rolling  he admires walker  not just because of his success  but because he value winning and the long  tough road one must travel to reach those height  <BRK> his testimony  in my opinion  is one that all our young kid need to hear   hick say   for some reason in new york  we make kid pro before they re pro  we hype these kid up to the point where they really think they re all that  and the kid don t really be that good  but when the kid start thinking that he s the cat s meow  that s when the problem arrives  <BRK>calhoun s word are more succinct  <BRK> his value are his value   he say   he never waver  <BRK>the question that ll tug at walker s core this summer  then  is simple  what if the only way to win is to waver <BRK>
