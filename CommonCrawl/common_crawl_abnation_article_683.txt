here s a brief history of thing that demanded our attention during the first half of the nba season   <BRK> that s   a lot  it s also a very incomplete list of the storyline that spun through the     medium cycle so far this season   <BRK> so what s in store for the second half  all of the above  plus the trade deadline  playoff jockeying  and a most valuable player race that is just taking shape  <BRK> right up until mid december  the discussion belonged to giannis antetokounmpo  there were other contender for sure  but the conversation inevitably found it way back to milwaukee  where antetokounmpo ha taken several long stride toward superstardom   <BRK> the number are outrageous      point      rebound      assist    percent field goal shooting  more importantly  giannis  buck have ascended from a middle of the pack eastern conference playoff team to one of the league s very best  it s the oldest mvp narrative in the book  and it s the way my hypothetical vote would go at midseason   <BRK> this wa an easier case to make before james harden went code red on the rest of the league  harden ha averaged better than   point a game since dec     in addition to dishing out almost   assist and gobbling up more than seven rebound per contest  he s impossible to guard and even harder to officiate  in short  harden is the most complete offensive player in the world right now   <BRK> paul flannery s signature sunday shootaround column ha returned  every sunday morning  grab a cup of coffee  sit back  and take a look back at the week that wa in the nba   <BRK> march    the pacer lost their star and found a  unified spirit march    the nugget are the nba s anachronistic contendermarch    de aaron fox is fat and moving in the right directionmarch    the cae for james harden a the nba s mvpmarch    damian lillard talk fatherhood  the blazer  and perspectivefeb     the nba s realest drama remains on the courtfeb     the improved but not new blake griffinfrom the archive      the giannis antetokounmpo dream becomes reality <BRK> harden ha the second oldest mvp narrative in the book  that of the lone star keeping his undermanned team afloat and defying all odds  without chris paul and eric gordon  the beard ha led a rocket revival  a if his challenge couldn t get even more absurd  harden will now have to do it without center clint capela  who will be out     week with a thumb injury   <BRK> so  it s a two person contest at the halfway point  but don t discount late charge from oh  a dozen other player  from anthony davis to paul george  with nikola jokic and joel embiid in between kevin durant  steph curry  lebron james  and kawhi leonard  there will be no shortage of contender   <BRK> that s an awful lot of superstar talent playing at an elite level at one time  it s also the biggest reason why the nba in in such a healthy place during a period of one team dominance  save for that one notable super team in oakland  the star power is spread throughout the league in an era where offensive ability is at a premium   <BRK> here are my pick for the other award race at the midway point   <BRK> coach of the year  mike budenholzer with numerous others chasing   <BRK> defensive player  paul george for now  but way too early to make a clear assessment   <BRK> rookie of the year  luka doncic in a landslide  but watch the development of deandre ayton and jaren jackson jr  anyway   <BRK> sixth man  domantas sabonis narrowly over montrezl harrell   <BRK> most improved  pascal siakam  along with de aaron fox and john collins   <BRK> it say something about our perception of both club that while they have clearly been the class of the conference  they are far from prohibitive favorite  the raptor have all that negative playoff history  while the buck don t have any positive moment of recent vintage   <BRK> it s hard to believe it s been almost two decade since milwaukee got within a seventh game of reaching the final  but that   run wa the last time the buck advanced past the first round   shoutout to ray allen  sam cassell  big dog robinson  the other ervin johnson  and george karl    <BRK> that ha nothing to do with this current buck squad  but it doe speak to a lack of postseason experience among it core member  there s also the notion that mike budenholzer s team are better equipped for the regular season than the postseason  a theory that will be put to the test this spring   <BRK> a for the raptor  kawhi leonard and danny green have given this team a new energy  while pacal siakam and serge ibaka bring new dimension to their age old playoff dilemma  a always  however  it come down to kyle lowry  if the nba s most endearing grump stay fresh for the spring  then maybe  just maybe  the nba final will begin in canada   <BRK> a an aide  could kawhi really leave if that happens   <BRK>

   <BRK> despite their latest struggle with identity   now it s the defense that s gone missing   there are many people in the league who still feel like the c s are the favorite to come out the east  i remain unconvinced  and that wa before their latest three game losing streak brought their weird vibe into the open    <BRK> minor injury have been an issue   not having aron baynes is a big deal   but lot of team go through injury and find way to prosper  the celtic have overcome those ailment  sometime  other time  not so much  they ve had winning streak interrupted by frustrating losing skid and seem to lack resolve when thing get hard   <BRK> that s bad  but there s more  they ve blown team out of the building on occasion and also developed a maddening habit of kicking away game on the road  they ve had team meeting to clear the air and still get caught arguing with each other during game  on and on it go   <BRK>  you try to take the back road and see how this guy is  he doesn t come off a a guy that think he s the man  he s comfortable  he ha fun  he s a big kid  <BRK> kyrie irving s rep is often that of a weird  free thinking loner  but a sb nation s jessica camerato report  that couldn t be further from the truth  <BRK> this will be framed a a referendum on kyrie irving s leadership ability  even if it wa deserved  calling out young player in the same manner he wa called out in cleveland wa a curious move  until they learn how to play for one another every night  they will remain polarizing  the question for danny ainge is whether it s worth shaking thing up with a deadline deal  he s resisted  so far   <BRK> so much of their fate ultimately relies on al horford being healthy and energized for the playoff   <BRK> since adding jimmy butler and inserting j j  redick and wilson chandler into the starting lineup  philly s starting five is a monster  outscoring opponent by more than   point per   possession  it may be an unwieldy monster at time  but it s still a mighty beast  <BRK> now imagine how good they could be if their chemistry come together     <BRK> sussing out team dynamic is always a dangerous game  but the circumstantial evidence point to three star vying for element of control  that s alright in january  it might even be healthy in the long run to let butler slowly develop a working relationship with joel embiid and ben simmons  who are still working out the kink with one another   <BRK> the pessimistic take is that butler will destroy the team from within  which he s done in his two previous stop  and then take his game somewhere else in the offseason   <BRK>

   <BRK> come may  the sixer need to have a clearer view of how they intend to win game   <BRK> given their star power  and the personality involved  the sixer are the conference s wild card  of note  like last season  when they picked up ersan ilyasova and marco belinelli  they have room to be a player on the buyout market  those move surged philadelphia into the no    seed when they were previously closer to     the sixer are a developing situation   <BRK> sure  in that indiana is a good basketball team that play defense consistently and doesn t beat itself  you d be hard pressed to find anyone in the league who think the pacer have a ceiling beyond being a very good basketball team  but they have people s respect   <BRK> team don t get enough praise for improving organically  and there might be more to this club than meet the eye  going     without victor oladipo showed that they re more than the vic show  and oladipo still han t played his best basketball yet  myles turner ha quietly begun to come into his own on the defensive end and domantas sabonis is a handful   <BRK> if they can avoid the     matchup of death  the pacer have a viable chance at making some noise this postseason  credit to them for improving  that s supposed to be the whole point of this league   <BRK> while not the logjam in the west  there are still six team vying for three playoff spot  if nothing else  their desire to stay in the race will play a part in the evolving trade market prior to the feb    deadline    <BRK> of the six  miami ha the most pedigree  charlotte ha the biggest star in kemba walker  who is also about to be a free agent  detroit ha two star in blake griffin and andre drummond and really should be better than it is  brooklyn is feisty  orlando is hanging around  and washington s recent play behind bradley beal is damn near inspiring    <BRK> half those team will make the playoff  while the other half will have top   pick  all of them will have decision to make soon about how hard they want to push or pull back  each of those decision will impact a trade market that ha yet to take shape  the trade deadline ha been a dud in recent year  but it only take one pivotal move to start a chain reaction   <BRK> this is really another way of aking if the dub are actually in some sort of trouble  the working asumption all seaon is that a long a all of their core four are healthy  then the warrior will roll to another championship  to put it another way  the warrior were never supposed to actually need demarcus cousin to win a championship   <BRK> before we write off the warrior  malaise  here are some episode they ve survived over the year  <BRK> semantics  perhaps  but boogie s return this week from an achilles injury come at a good time for the warrior  who are getting into one of their periodic groove  assuming his body will allow him to play meaningful minute  cousin is a top notch passer from the high post in addition to being a reliable catch and shoot   point threat and a   rebound banger on the board  even in limited dos  all of those skill will benefit the warrior tremendously   <BRK> steve kerr plan to start cousin  so it will be fascinating to see how he blend with golden state s other star  especially on the defensive end  transition defense ha never been is strong suit  but it han t exactly been a team strength this season either   <BRK> at the very leat  boogie s return should keep thing interesting for the warrior a they prepare for their real seaon in april   <BRK> on paper and in the standing  it s the nugget  who have depth and defense around a developing superstar in nikola jokic  the offense added even more firepower when the invaluable will barton returned from injury last week  if their defense hold up  which hasn t happened of late   the only thing holding denver back is a lack of postseason experience  there will be no gimmes in the west come playoff time   <BRK> the team with the second most starpower is probably oklahoma city  the thunder have the league s best defense and an mvp candidate in paul george  but a always    point shooting is a major issue   <BRK> it might still be houston if chris paul can recapture his form  harden is playing out of his mind  but we ve seen how the one man show wear down in the spring   <BRK> it could be san antonio  the nba s luddite live in the mid range  but come to play with size and a revamped defense  they won t go easy  neither will the clipper  who play hard and come at you in wave  both are effective regular season tactic  the blazer are always the right matchup away from a playoff run  or a wrong one from a short stay   <BRK> utah  did someone say utah   i think it might really be utah     <BRK> for a brief period of time toward the end of the   calendar year  it looked like the lakers had something cooking  thanks to the addition of tyson chandler  their defense wa locking into place right when lebron james wa making his mvp case   <BRK> then bron got hurt  and the young laker supporting cast look like it might be year away   <BRK> sb nation stom ziller coined the term  lakers exceptionalism  several year ago  here is a history of him and other sb nation writer using that term over the year  <BRK> nov        jim bus and the myth of lakers exceptionalismjuly       melo to lakers rumor show how ridiculous lakers exceptionalism isjuly       lakers mystique is deadoct        jim bus wa right about one thing  lakers exceptionalism doesn t existjuly       lakers exceptionalism is deadjan        the lakers are still betting on their legacyfeb        time to believe in lakers exceptionalism againmarch       haha nevermindmarch       the lakers can t sell reality because fantasy is all they have <BRK> it s still hard to imagine a playoff without lebron involved  and assuming he doe get back before the all star break  there s every reason to believe the lakers will also get back on track  still  a number of deserving team in the west will be home early this spring  and the lakers have already lost their cushion   <BRK> the real question all along is whether they re building something with their young core or if this current iteration is just a transition phase to a future filled with free agent superstar teammate for lebron  it s hard to see a playoff run changing that calculus    <BRK> no matter how this turn out  dallas and sacramento are fine  both have better day ahead of them  even if they sneak into the postseason  memphis and minnesota need to do some soul searching   <BRK> the big issue that affect everything this summer is whether anthony davis yearns to leave new orleans if the pelican come up short  team have been waiting year for that fantasy to become a reality  but the pel won t let him go without a fight  new orleans ha traditionally been a second half team and will be among those willing to make a deal at the deadline   <BRK> a with the bottom half of the eat bracket  the line between playoff contender and lottery participant is a thin one  however fleeting  there are still   team with playoff hope remaining  the one that blink will be the most active at the deadline   <BRK> no doubt between now and april there will be dozen of other absurdity to occupy our time  the nba life to generate storyline and even in it most predictable state  this whole season ha felt like a giant question mark  we re all waiting for whatever happens next  resolution is le than six month away  <BRK>
