over the past five year  and nine of the last    the first overall pick at the nfl draft ha been either a quarterback or a pas rusher  espn draft expert mel kiper jr  doesn t see that trend ending in   <BRK>kiper s first mock draft of the new year is out  and it s got ohio state edge rusher nick bosa earning top honor  the former buckeye would be an immediate boost to the cardinal  pas rush  giving arizona and first year head coach kliff kingsbury a pocket crumpling pair of blitzing bookend between bosa and all pro chandler jones <BRK>bosa to glendale isn t a particularly bold prediction  kiper s just the latest draftnik to mock the talented pas rusher at no    overall   both pro football focus and sb nation s dan kadar each predicted a warm desert climate for the serial quarterback harasser this week  but kiper isn t one and done with defense at the top of his draft  each of his next three pick  from the  er to the raider  feature an elite defensive player headed to a rebuilding team <BRK>that start with kentucky edge rusher josh allen  who would immediately become the highest josh allen ever drafted by earning a selection at the  er no    slot  he s followed by beefy alabama defensive tackle quinnen williams  who would join leonard williams in the trench with the jet  and jon gruden s tanking would earn it first reward outside of utterly frustrating the resident of oakland   lsu cornerback greedy williams <BRK>that would be a major shift from   s draft  which saw two quarterback snapped up in the first three pick  but don t worry   kiper still rate a handful of franchise passer earning day   grade  including    <BRK>murray  the reigning heisman trophy winner who ha the opportunity to be a first round draft pick in both baseball and football  heard his name called at the no    pick in kiper s first mock of    that made him the second quarterback selected in the simulation  behind one of the men he beat out for college football s top honor  ohio state passer dwayne hakins slide into the sixth overall pick  moving from columbus to north new jersey to become the giant  quarterback of the future <BRK>only one other qb earned a first round grade from kiper  and it wasn t big armer missouri passer drew lock  instead  duke signal caller daniel jones walk to the podium on thursday night after being selected by the patriot with the  th pick of the draft  there  he will sit behind tom brady for three season  then be traded away to a west coast team after brady declares he s capable of playing until  the heat death of the universe  <BRK>green bay sent a clear message about contending through aaron rodgers  lat act a a quarterback by firing longtime head coach mike mccarthy in december  kiper see the club giving his replacement matt lafleur a pair of weapon that will fill the two biggest hole on the team s roster <BRK>that start at the no    slot  where the packer pick up clemson defensive end clelin farrell  the green bay pas rush wa better than expected in    but with clay matthew <BRK>a  facing free agency  andb  old enough to have once been the face of fathead house sticker tm <BRK>and with a roster that can t quite count on nick perry or kyler fackrell to put together consistent pro bowl level performance  adding a powerful pas rusher who can play on the end or at linebacker would be a boon <BRK>the team face a similar situation at wide receiver  where davante adam remains great but rodgers would probably like to avoid facing multiple game where marquez valdes scantling and equanimeous st  brown are his other starting target  kiper remedy that by mocking electric ohio state wideout parris campbell to the smallest of the nfl s small market with the  st pick of the draft  traded by the saint last spring  <BRK>no team in the league ha more draft capital than oakland  who famously sold off star khalil mack and amari cooper in order to fuel gruden s rebuild in some undetermined location next fall  kiper ha the club taking     prototype cornerback williams with it own pick  then using the selection gleaned from the cowboy and bear in the second half of the first round to add some punch to   s  th ranked offense <BRK>that start with marquise brown  the wide receiver who parlayed two season at oklahoma into a prolific stretch that saw him boost two different heisman campaign  while he s a slight target at     and   pound  he s an absolute burner who wa responsible for     receiving yard    touchdown  and a ridiculous     yard per catch in his two year in norman  <BRK>he s joined by alabama tight end irv smith jr   who would complement the team s leading target jared cook  that duo would give the club a pair of dynamic playmaker up the seam  pairing with brown to give derek carr a revamped offense and the chance to prove he can be a successful quarterback when not forced to wander the bombed out wateland that wa gruden s   raider roster <BRK>kiper s draft is pretty similar to kadar s  the duo each have the same player in their top six  with only a flip at no    and no    separating the two expert  they each see the packer going pas rusher playmaker and believe the raider will add at least one high value target to their receiving corp<BRK>kadar is more bullish on this year s crop of passer  slotting four quarterback in the first   pick while kiper only see two in his first   pick  and kiper belief t j  hockenson and not noah fant will be the first iowa tight end selected in    there s still several month and approximately one million workout left before this year s draft fall into place  and this is just a series of best guess based on past performance and logic   two function that make it nearly impossible to figure out what gruden is going to do <BRK>plus  keep in mind kiper s first mock draft of   had wyoming qb josh allen going no    overall  so it s not like this whole thing is a science <BRK>
