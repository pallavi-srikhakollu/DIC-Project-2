for three of the last four weekend  the michigan wolverine have suffered disappointment at the hand of the team s in state rival  michigan lost at home to the spartan on february  th  on the road on march  th  and last sunday to conclude the   big ten tournament  <BRK> by any stretch  not what wolverine fan were hoping to see  <BRK> however  even with the misstep  michigan enters the ncaa tournament in pretty good shape  the wolverine are     overall and are     in the team s last nine game against team other than michigan state  in fact  michigan is     this season against opponent other than the spartan  unfortunately  the recent struggle against michigan state have overshadowed this success  <BRK> but the ncaa tournament committee did seem to take note of michigan s profile lat sunday a the wolverine were placed a a two seed in the west region  the wolverine will tip off with a matchup against montana on thursday night   <BRK> so  how doe michigan matchup against the grizzly  let s take a look  <BRK> if this matchup felt eerily similar on sunday night  that s because it should  the two team faced off in the opening round of last year s ncaa tournament  with michigan grabbing a     win over the grizzly in route to a final four trip  <BRK> however  this year s montana squad is a much weaker team on paper  the grizzly are  th nationally on kenpom  which is roughly   spot lower on kenpom  this is despite the fact that the team ha an identical overall record a lat year s group  during the regular seaon  montana went     against top   team on kenpom  the grizzly never played a team above  st nationally in that metric  <BRK> the strength of montana s team lie in it ability to shoot the ball efficiently on offense  montana play slow  but hit it shot  the grizzlie are seventh nationally in effective field goal percentage and top   in both two and three point percentage  if montana can make this a low possession game  it shooting could be a huge factor  <BRK> for montana to pull off the upset  it s also going to need a big game from sayeed pridgett  he s scored double digit in   straight game for the grizzly  sophomore guard timmy fall is also going to have to bring his a game  he s been inconsistent and will have his hand full with zavier simpson  <BRK> what s interesting about this matchup is that these team play relatively similar style on the court  both would prefer to play slow with a maximum emphasis on each possession  michigan s better at avoiding turnover  but montana is more efficient shooting the ball  expect it to come down to who commits turnover and or waste possession with questionable attempt  <BRK> with that said  michigan is clearly the favorite in this game  the wolverine have six loss this season and all came against top   opponent on kenpom  the grizzly haven t even played a top   opponent yet this season and rank  th in the metric  michigan played seven opponent outside the top   this season and scored double digit victory over six of them   <BRK> still  montana will be comfortable playing slowly and come into this game with some confidence  the grizzly have only lost two game since january  th and will be eager to get revenge for last year s ncaa loss to michigan  expect montana to come out firing in the opening minute  <BRK>
