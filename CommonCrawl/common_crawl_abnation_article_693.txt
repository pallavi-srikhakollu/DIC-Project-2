in the portland region  there are the top seed and then there are the mid major  with the latter bound to take center stage a the team continue to prove themselves  <BRK> mississippi state winning it first two game mean having the distinct honor of traveling to portland  where a meeting with oregon could take place  the duck  campus is under two hour from portland  while mississippi state would be making the longest trip of any one seed to it regional location  <BRK> but that can all be sorted out later   <BRK> with one of the most exciting first time mid major matchup in south dakota state versus quinnipiac  the winner of this clash of titan could very well make a sweet sixteen appearance  then  there s florida gulf coast  which seems primed to take advantage of miami s ncaa tournament woe of late and grab what could be the biggest upset of the region  and south dakota stand a solid chance of beating an acc team in the first round to advance  <BRK> while this region doesn t have the sparkle of no    overall seed baylor or the name recognition of uconn  some excellent competition awaits nonetheless  <BRK> southern ha had been on a successful run of late  taking down quadruple double queen shakyla hill and grambling state en route to beating jackson state for the swac tournament title  but the jaguar don t have teaira mccowan  and they re not riding high off their first ever sec tournament title  a mississippi state is  it ll be a tall order from start to finish for this southern squad to take down the bulldog  <BRK> the first of three in state matchup in this region  this one will be a good test for portland state to see if it postseaon magic ha run dry  a the four seed in the big sky tournament  the viking knocked off top seed idaho to advance to the title game  where they beat fellow cinderella eatern wahington  but this seaon s oregon team   despite a rather rocky final month to it seaon   simply doesn t seem the type to lose in the first round  <BRK> the orange excelled in the tough acc this seaon  reaching the semifinal of the conference tournament and earning it highest ever ncaa seed a a result  fordham  while battle tested in it own right   zipping through the atlantic   tournament   is playing in it first ncaa tournament since    with experience on it side  including a   national championship game appearance  syracuse should take this game on it home floor  <BRK> this is where the in state matchup get interesting  in the past three season  miami ha played in four ncaa tournament game  two loss to quinnipiac  a loss to south dakota state and a        versus   nail biter win over florida gulf coast in    miami really need a win  having lost it last two game  while fgcu is riding a   game winning streak that stretch across an undefeated run in a   play  <BRK> the eagle stand an excellent chance of pulling off the upset  but if the hurricane play the way they did in their win over notre dame  it could be the runaway victory they need to start a new streak  <BRK> arizona state s schedule is highlighted by close loss to excellent team  a well a a seaon sweep of oregon state that is surely something to be proud of  ucf  meanwhile  wa this seaon s baeline for uconn s strength in the american  coming in second while losing it three meeting with the husky by     point apiece  this doesn t mean that ucf isn t good in it own right  just that the team likely lack the experience to keep up with the sun devil in this one  <BRK> this is  frankly  a dream mid major matchup  two team with proven success year after year meeting for the very first time on the biggest stage  it s a shame that one of them ha to go home  because both team could very well make deep run  <BRK> south dakota state ha the more impressive résumé  beating the like of drake and green bay while only losing by single digit to oregon and baylor  but quinnipiac went undefeated in the maac  ha some close loss on it record  to texas and missouri  and ha been something of an upset machine over the past few ncaa tournament  <BRK> if there s one must watch game in the first round of the portland region  it s this one   the mid major clash that should have happened much sooner  <BRK> indiana obviously won t be defending it wnit title which  while exciting  offer a more difficult path for postseason success  especially since the hoosier are facing the somewhat under seeded texas longhorn  whose late season stumble cost them a chance to host any tournament game  <BRK> indiana s big ten season featured a stretch where it lost eight of   game  but that stretch ended with a win over then no    iowa  thus  this hoosier team stand a chance against the longhorn  but if they don t show up  texas should take the game  <BRK> despite losing the summit league championship game  south dakota still managed to grab the conference s first ever at large bid on the strength of it     record  the coyote  first two month of the seaon included win over then no    iowa state  missouri state and then no    missouri   all team playing in this seaon s tournament  clemson  while having the benefit of playing in a stronger conference  ha had trouble all seaon with team nowhere nearly a good a the yotes  if they are able to get in the right mindset  south dakota can win this game  <BRK> the   ncaa woman s basketball
