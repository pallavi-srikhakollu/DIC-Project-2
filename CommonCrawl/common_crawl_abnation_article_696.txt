the memphis grizzly will finally listen to trade offer on mike conley and marc gasol  the last two domino of the grit  n grind era before the franchise pivot to build around rookie sensation jaren jackson jr  the news come on the heel of a remarkable skid in which the grizzly lost   of their last   game  <BRK> memphis should be able to find a trade for each of it two veteran star  even with conley s remaining two year worth    million after this season  gasol will make      million this season with a      million player option next year   <BRK> the   nba free agency class is loaded  and team will be stingy with their cap space to have room a max contract with a      million year   salary  but depending on how much memphis value each player  there are suitor out there for conley and gasol  it s just a matter of finding the right deal  <BRK> here are nine we like  <BRK> indiana ha started darren collison at the point guard slot during their playoff run  so an upgrade at that spot would make this already dangerous team even more lethal  <BRK> this  though  creates a two pronged conundrum  <BRK> victor oladipo  myles turner and domantas sabonis are untouchable  so is a combination of the expiring contract of collison and tyreke evans  along with another player  doug mcdermott    a prospect  t j  leaf or aaron holiday    and a first rounder or two enough for memphis  <BRK> the maverick now belong to luka doncic  so everything dallas doe from this day forward will be in service of putting the best possible team around their rookie sensation   <BRK> yet dallas is also in a win now posture  and even though dennis smith jr  ha rejoined the team  it s still unclear whether he and doncic can make it work long term  center could be a need  too  earlier this year  some maverick teammate reportedly felt deandre jordan wa being selfish by snatching every rebound coming off the glass   <BRK> the maverick could trade for one of the two grizzly pillar  or both  <BRK> maverick receive  mike conleygrizzlies receive  dennis smith jr   harrison barnes  dallas    first round pick  <BRK> maverick receive  marc gasolgrizzlies receive  deandre jordan  straight up  or with draft consideration  <BRK> maverick receive  mike conley and marc gasolgrizzlies receive  dennis smith jr   deandre jordan  harrison barnes  right to two way player kostas antetokounmpo  dallas    first round pick <BRK> first it wa tony parker  who left san antonio for charlotte over the summer  then it wa lonnie walker iv  the explosive rookie point guard who tore his meniscus in the preseason  to add insult to injury  dejounte murray tore his acl in the very next preseason game   <BRK> with all three out  the spur have started derrick white and bryn forbes at the point and have given patty mill minute a their backup  they re all decent baketball player  but the spur are missing a true floor general on the court  conley would be a perfect fit  a playmaker who can relieve demar derozan of his offensive load while playing cat and mouse with lamarcus aldridge   <BRK> trading for conley  though  would certainly cost san antonio one of murray or walker  and other aset they may not want to surrender  the deal here look like conley and omri caspi for mill  walker  rudy gay and dante cunningham  a protected first can be included  a well  <BRK> a for gaol  could we see another spanish brother for brother swap  like when the lakers traded the draft right to marc gaol in that famous   deal that sent pau to los angeles  to take on marc s contract  the spur would have have to match his    million salary  they re not giving up derozan or aldridge  so pau ha to be included  <BRK> even still  there s an    million pay gap between the two brother that ll be hard to bridge  bu how fun would it be if they either a  played on the same team  or b  were traded for each other again  <BRK> the sixer hoped markelle fultz would be the point guard that tied everything together  but his shoulder issue   thoraccic outlet syndrome  to be exact   ha kept him off the court much of the season with little to no productivity while he wa on it  ben simmons ha been the primary ball handler  but his unwillingness to shoot from the perimeter will give an edge to defense when guarding him in the postseason  <BRK> bringing conley in would establish order in philly  he s a player who is capable of creating his own shot  but doesn t look to do so until it s absolutely necessary  he s the definition of a floor general  and can still play off simmons a well  he s exactly what the doctor ordered in philly  <BRK> the daily memphian s chris herrington suggests a trade of conley and omri casspi to the sixer for fultz  wilson chandler  mike muscala and draft asset  if fultz fully recovers from his tos and is the player we saw at washington  he and jaren jackson jr would be a scary combo   <BRK> a for the sixer  a five man lineup of simmons  joel embiid  jimmy butler  j j  redick and mike conley would be dangerous at the top of the eatern conference  though it d also become expensive  <BRK> the hornet remain a fringe playoff team  with an all star point guard in kemba walker who ha little help and is in the final year of his contract  gasol is not in his prime  but he s still capable of contributing on a team trying to win game  <BRK> would the grizzly trade one more season of gasol for two more season of nic batum  plus charlotte s protected first round pick  or  maybe a deal of cody zeller and michael kidd gilchrist s expiring contract for gasol and omri casspi  plus the pick  get this one done  <BRK> the heat are another team that will find it difficult to sign free agent outside of rookie and their taxpayer s mid level and minimum contract exception next summer  unlike the piston  though  miami ha player other team might want  <BRK> if the grizzly are going to rebuild  it won t be fast  they can deal conley and shelvin mack to miami for goran dragic  tyler johnson and a pair of first round pick in   and    <BRK> there s also a straight up swap  gasol for hassan whiteside  <BRK> the grizzly  though  will want attractive draft asset and or salary relief in any deal for either of their veteran  trading straight up for whiteside doesn t help their rebuild  <BRK> the piston have blake griffin and andre drummond  but just can t seem to get over the fringe playoff hump  which is a testament to the importance of guard play  the piston are also in luxury tax hell  so it won t be player in a class that includes kyrie irving  kemba walker and eric bledsoe  if the piston want to win now and improve their guard position  the best bet is to make a trade now  <BRK> the deal will cost the piston a future first round pick and young player stanley johnson  but detroit ha to do something   <BRK> that s not an attractive trade for the grizzly  so detroit may even need to include luke kennard   and even that might not be enough <BRK> the piston are in tough place  they need a point guard  they can t sign one  and they have few trade asset anyone else want  <BRK> the magic are a legitimate point guard away from playoff contention out east  enter mike conley  legitimate point guard pairing conley with aaron gordon and nikola vucevic would certainly propel orlando to the postseason   <BRK> the only issue is who doe orlando give up to match conley s    million salary  would orlando offer it own pick and oklahoma city s   first rounder to land conley  if so  this is the kind of deal that could vault them into the postseason  <BRK> memphis receives  evan fournier  jonathon simmons  jerian grant  orlando s   first round pick  oklahoma city s top   protected   first round pickorlando receives  mike conley <BRK> hi  this is kristian s editor  mike prada  hijacking this post with a controversial take  the buck should trade for mike conley   kristian doe not endorse this message   <BRK> i get why the buck wouldn t want to rock the boat  they have the league s best net rating and are pushing first place in the east  with a system that make more out of the sum of it part  but with just   month until giannis anteteokounmpo must decide on a supermax extension  milwaukee s window is now   <BRK> conley is a definite upgrade on eric bledsoe  despite being older and having a long term contract  though bledsoe ha fit in well in mike budenholzer s system  team will be more daring leaving him open in the postseason  given his   percent three point mark and career long issue with turnover  though he is averaging a career low in turnover percentage this season   conley  on the other hand  is clutch and sure handed  which hold extra value in the postseason  <BRK> conley also allows the buck to avoid a tricky offseaon dilemma  how much to pay bledsoe a a free agent  bledsoe will command a large  long term contract this summer  wherea conley s deal  while hefty for the next two year  aligns perfectly with antetokounmpo s window   <BRK> the buck don t have a first round pick to trade until    but they do have stuff to offer memphis  i propose offering      <BRK>     for conley and another player   perhaps jamychal green  garrett temple  or  more realistically  a minimum salaried player   <BRK> it s a risky move for the buck  but if it mean cementing yourselves a the favorite to make the final  it s worth it  <BRK>
