andy reid ha racked up   regular seaon win during his career a a head coach and another   playoff victory  his   total win are eighth all time  but all seven coach ahead of him   don shula  george hala  bill belichick  tom landry  curly lambeau  paul brown  and chuck noll   have at leat two championship each  reid ha been to just one super bowl and didn t win it  <BRK> with patrick mahomes at quarterback  this season s version of the kansa city chief could be reid s best shot at finally getting the lombardi trophy that s eluded him over the last two decade  <BRK> to get it done  reid might have to shake his reputation a coach who s terrible at managing the clock   especially when his two worst time related failure came in playoff game against the patriot  <BRK> the only trip to the super bowl the coach ha ever made came in february   when the eagle played the new england patriot  <BRK> the patriot were the defending champion and a touchdown favorite over the eagle  but only won     in a tightly contested game  the eagle were doomed by four turnover  and also by horrible management of the clock at the end of each half   <BRK> reid s fumbling of his timeouts and the eagle  last chance at a comeback were so bad that it earned him a reputation he still ha   year later  <BRK> at the end of the first half  philadelphia had a chance to score to break a     tie and take a lead into halftime  after taking over on their own   yard line with     left  the eagle were fine with running out the clock   <BRK> the patriot stuffed brian westbrook for a loss on first down and called timeout  but the eagle got   yard back with a pas to todd pinkston  they ran the clock from   second to   second before throwing again to pinkston for   yard  that s when reid decided to use the eagle  first timeout of the half with only   second left  <BRK> the team s drive ended with a   yard rush for brian westbrook that got the eagle to the patriot    yard line a time expired  philadelphia went to halftime with two timeouts remaining  <BRK>  i don t remember that at all  to be honest with you   reid said when asked about the questionable clock management at the end of the first half  <BRK> still  the eagle were tied with the patriot with one half left  <BRK> it wa a     game after three quarter  but new england took control in the fourth quarter  a two yard touchdown from running back corey dillon and a   yard field goal from adam vinatieri put the patriot up      <BRK> donovan mcnabb threw an interception on his next possession  but the eagle  defense forced a three and out to give the offense the ball back with just under six minute left  philadelphia needed two score and fast  you sure couldn t tell by watching the game  though  <BRK> the eagle dinked and dunked down the field  gaining   yard on the first   play of the drive  philadelphia already burned one timeout while on defense in the third quarter  and didn t use any during the drive  reid even risked burning another timeout by challenging a   yard completion to greg lewis that wa ruled incomplete  although the replay overturned the call to bail reid out  <BRK>  how many philadelphia fan are screaming at the tv  saying  hurry up     joe buck asked about halfway through the drive  <BRK> after the two minute warning  the eagle finally took a shot downfield and scored a   yard touchdown on a pas from mcnabb to lewis with     left  <BRK>  well  we were trying to hurry up   reid said after the game  via espn   it wa the way thing worked out   <BRK> the onside kick failed and the eagle managed to get a stop with their two timeouts  but they took over on their own four yard line with   second left  a one yard completion to brian westbrook wasted   of those second and an interception ended the game two play later  <BRK> new england got the win   despite an underwhelming performance   and  from that point on  reid wa labeled a a disater at managing the clock  over the next decade or so  he provided more example to drive the reputation home  <BRK> in the year after super bowl    there were a few more time reid messed up  <BRK> there wa the time in   when the eagle picked up a delay of game penalty right after a replay review   costing them what could ve been a touchdown before halftime  <BRK>  we had the play called for inch and inch weren t inch when that thing restarted   reid said after the game   the position of the ball wasn t where we thought      i goofed   <BRK> a few week earlier  reid burned the eagle  second half timeouts with           and     left in the game  philadelphia lost both of those game to start the season      <BRK> reid wa fired by the eagle after the   season  and immediately got another chance with the chief  but the criticism of his clock management didn t pick up much steam until it came roaring back when the chief were eliminated by the patriot in the divisional round in january     <BRK> it wa reid s third season in kansa city and the chief blew the door off the houston texan in the first round of the playoff   the team s first postseason win in   year  <BRK> a week later against the patriot  the chief faced a similar situation that the eagle did in super bowl    they were down     and got the ball back with     left in the fourth quarter  the drive that ensued took   play and over five minute of game clock before charcandrick west punched in a one yard rushing touchdown  <BRK> when the onside kick for the chief wa recovered by new england  the patriot only needed one first down to end the game and they got it  reid s clock mismanagement killed any chance at a comeback and came back to haunt another team in the postseason  he wa subsequently roasted for it  <BRK> the chief  timeout usage in a week   loss to the patriot this season came under fire  but really there aren t that many case where reid screwed up  <BRK> he s been an nfl head coach since   and that s given him a lot of opportunity to make mistake   something coach in the nfl do all the time  even the infallible bill belichick cost the patriot a win this season by inexplicably putting rob gronkowski on the field to defend a hail mary that never had a chance of being thrown  <BRK> a statistical analysis from sb nation s packer blog  acme packing company  even showed the chief a one of the best team in the nfl at strategically using timeouts in    <BRK> but reid s clock mismanagement ha come at the worst time and on the biggest stage possible  and the patriot have often been the beneficiary  to finally get back to the super bowl and take the chief there for the first time in   year  reid can t afford to goof again  <BRK>
