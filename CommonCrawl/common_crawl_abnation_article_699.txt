central to the debate over whether to expand the college football playoff is the question of whether team outside the power   conference have fair access  no team in a non power league ha come close to making it yet  and the committee s repeatedly ranked high profile mid major below where those team show up in advanced metric and the newspaper poll  <BRK> one way to make the committee look like it actually offer a path for every team in fbs   a it claim  to much mockery   would be to create a selection committee that actually mirror the   team breadth of fbs  rather than mostly featuring people with direct tie to power   school  baed on the first five and counting seaons  that is not a priority  <BRK> but there is a reason the playoff insists on it member recusing themselves from discussing team to which they have close connection  it s about  if absolutely nothing else  avoiding the appearance of bias   <BRK> and based on nothing but head count  it is not hard to wonder whether the power   s overwhelming majority in the room factor into the final ranking in some way   <BRK> it s certainly fair to argue no group of   team should ve made the four team playoff in it first five year  but poll and computer have frequently suggested those team should be coming closer than they are  <BRK>
