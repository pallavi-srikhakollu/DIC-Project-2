the calendar turn to march in just five week  but the college basketball season ha provided more question than answer so far with regard to the   nba draft  just about the only thing everyone can agree on is that zion williamson should be the first pick <BRK>after that  it s anyone s guess <BRK>this is our first mock since late november  so much ha changed since then  murray state point guard ja morant ha shot into the top five and established himself a a legitimate contender to go no    overall  texa center jaxson hayes ha burst onto the scene and positioned himself a a possible lottery pick  texa tech s jarrett culver ha arguably helped himself a much a any player in the country <BRK>a lot can change before june  but this is what the nba draft picture look like right now  you already know who s going no    <BRK>williamson will be the first pick in the draft  at this point  the only debate lie in how he measure up against the other no    overall pick this decade like ben simmons  karl anthony town  and anthony davis <BRK>

  <BRK>for my money  williamson ha the potential to be a good a any of them depending how a team build around him  he simply ha a masive influence on winning   not just because of his unprecedented combination of strength  agility  and athleticism  but also because he s a smart  versatile forward who always seems to make the right play when the ball is in his hand  that doesn t even mention his defensive impact  where he s been a wrecking ball all seaon  stockpiling block and steal and turning takeaway into transition point one highlight reel play at a time  even a his jumper remains a work in progress  this is a franchise player by any definition <BRK>barrett ha been a productive a any player in college baketball this seaon  he just han t always been efficient in doing it  duke s showcae game against virginia lat weekend wa barrett at his best  finishing with   point on   of   shooting from the field against an elite defense  he wa le impressive against syracuse a game before  jacking up   shot and only scoring   point against jim boeheim s     zone <BRK>

  <BRK>of course  barrett won t be seeing a straight zone at the nba level  but his lack of pull up shooting and three point range continues to be an issue when projecting him a a pro  right now  barrett is a relentless volume scorer who is wired to get bucket no matter how the opposing defense is stacked against him  he should be using the rest of this seaon at duke learning how to leverage that scoring ability to make life eaier for his immensely talented teammate  even a barrett ha been a bit underwhelming when compared to his preseaon hype  no one else in this clas ha done enough to surpas him outside of williamson  <BRK>culver wa considered a fringe first round prospect in the preseaon  but ha shot up draft board during a breakout sophomore campaign by improving his scoring efficiency while significantly raising his usage rate  a     guard who may still be growing  culver is thriving a an offensive initiator this seaon  proving he can stockpile bucket      point per game  and still get his teammate involved by more than doubling his asist rate  he also play an integral role defensively for the country s no    defense  <BRK>culver might lack the ideal athletic pop for a top three draft pick  but he make up for it with versatility and smart  this is a big guard who can play on or off the ball  he s a reliable catch and shoot threat from three point range    percent  and also a master at moving around screen without the ball to put himself in position to score  he may not have the star upside of a player like barrett  but he almost feel like a safer bet to contribute to winning within a team construct <BRK>

  <BRK>bol is one of the most unique prospect in this draft  and he ll be one of the most polarizing  too  his strength and weakness are both equally obvious  at     with a     wingspan  he is a truly gifted shot maker with three point range    percent  on his jumper  when he s going  he can splash shot all the court no other player would think about  he put that length to use on the defensive end  too  where his block rate would have been top   in the country <BRK>his body will be a problem  bol remains rail thin  with skinny leg and narrow hip and a high center of gravity  he doesn t move well laterally and will likely be a target in switch on defense  the concern over his long term durability were already real even before the seaon ending foot injury that sidelined him after dec     he ll be viewed a one of the biggest boom or bust prospect in this draft <BRK>hunter is a huge  standing      weighing at leat   pound  and blessed with a     wingspan   combo forward who should be versatile on both end of the court  his offense ha taken a step up for virginia in his third college seaon  he redshirted a a freshman   seeing bump in scoring average      ppg   true shooting percentage    percent   and asist rate    percent   he s been a   percent three point shooter this year  but he s only taking two attempt per game <BRK>defensively  hunter put up curious low block and steal rate number while playing a key role in virginia s traditionally conservative no    ranked packline defense  he might not have huge offensive upside unless he progress a a playmaker  but if his jumper is for real from the nba line  he feel like one of the safest choice in this draft  <BRK>kevin porter jr  ha seen his stock fluctuate wildly in mid season mock draft like this one  when he wa cooking early in the season  there wa buzz he could go in the top five  lately  he just han t been playing  first because of a thigh injury  then because of a team suspension  porter ha only seen real minute in one game since nov     <BRK>when he s on  porter can be a mesmerizing offensive player a a     wing with an advanced offensive repertoire  you ll find step back jumper  dazzling finish at the rim  and three point range in his scoring package  nba team will wonder if he s functional or just flahy  a an upside play  porter would offer big value at this point in the lottery  he could go much higher <BRK>johnson doesn t really stand out in any particular area  but he s a well rounded prospect who should go in the lottery  he ha only average size for a wing at        pound and good not great explosiveness  but he s been able to get to the basket and to the foul line consistently at the college level for kentucky  he s shooting well from three point range    percent   but currently ha more turnover     than assist      <BRK>this is another player who may get drafted higher than this if he s consistently productive to close the season through march  this kentucky team need his perimeter scoring punch in the worst way <BRK>
