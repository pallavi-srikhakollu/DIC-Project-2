christian wilkins is a quality interior defensive line prospect <BRK>clemson moved him around from a five technique on the outside edge of the tackle on a couple of play  to a  i on the inside shade of the tackle  to a three technique on the outside edge of the guard  to a  i with an inside shade on a guard  to a one technique on either edge of the center  to some zero nose  and he held up well in all of those alignment  <BRK>that versatility is one of his strongest selling point  and wilkins ha already shown that he can play well in pretty much any defensive scheme <BRK> sturdy  is the word that came to mind while watching wilkins playing the run  although he wan t the biggest defensive tackle you will ever see at     and   pound  wilkins showed some really good functional strength on film  the guy wa hard to move once he anchored down <BRK>he did a really good job of holding his ground against double team for the most part  and occasionally he wa able to fight through them to get to the running back  too <BRK>wilkins also handled scoop block well  he had to give a little bit of ground at time initially  but he did a good job of expanding when one of the blocker came off the block to go up to the second level  that allowed him to force the ball carrier wider than he wanted to go on several occasion in the four game of his that i watched <BRK>in addition to being  sturdy   wilkins wa also pretty quick on his foot  it wa that quickness that allowed him to fire up the field and get penetration a a run defender on cutoff block  he had a real knack for avoiding getting cut off on the backside of a play <BRK>that ability came in handy several time in short yardage situation <BRK>his quickness also showed up big time when wilkins stunted laterally  he could make offensive linemen look positively silly if he caught them slipping when he wa on the move  one minute he would be lined up in the a gap  the next he would ve looped all the way around to the edge <BRK>i really enjoyed watching him play the run  against the pa  i didn t get to see wilkins in a lot of one on one situation  but what i did see of his pa rush ability wa positive  that wa particularly true when he lined up a a three technique <BRK>he showed me he can get off the ball in a hurry when he want to  and he ha pretty good rip and arm over move  wilkins did a nice job running pa rush game a well  particularly when he wa the penetrator <BRK>a lot of time  ironically enough  wilkins actually did his best work a a pas rusher when there were two men asigned to block him  he would just keep working his hand and drive right through those double team <BRK>this wa something that showed up on film in more than one game <BRK>fighting against two blocker like that is something that wilkins ha obviously worked hard on  and it paid off for him in college <BRK>i should point out that he had some decent power rush  a well  one thing i found interesting wa wilkins showed an ability to rush the inside half of the offensive tackle and come free to the quarterback  especially when running pas rush game  that isn t something i have seen a lot of from college prospect  a it s usually an old  vet  move in my experience <BRK>overall  wilkins is just a good football player  additionally  i can see that he ha a high football iq to go along with his better than average technique  he had a good feel for sniffing out screen and draw without getting fooled <BRK>his effort  something that is always a big deal for me  wa also outstanding <BRK>time and time again  i saw him chasing after the quarterback on scramble  i watched wilkins turn to run to the ball immediately after it wa thrown  i also saw him busting his as from his nose tackle position all the way out by the sideline  trying to make a play on a running back <BRK>he didn t always make it there fast enough to get in on the tackle on those play  but that s not the point of hustling  you aren t always going to get there  but you never know when your team is going to need you to make that tackle  you run because this just might be that play that make a huge difference when it is all said and done <BRK>like when the quarterback scramble on third and   and you make the tackle to keep him a few yard short <BRK>from what i saw  wilkins wa bound and determined to make sure he wa in position to make the tackle whenever that play came by busting his as and giving all out effort  not much more you can ask from any player <BRK>now  having said all those complimentary thing about him  i also have to say that i m not sold on wilkins being a first round prospect  i think he is ready to play right away  and that he will play well for whichever team pick him  but i don t know that he will ever be an elite player in the nfl <BRK>and really  that s fine  not everybody can be an elite player  that s kind of the point of the word in the first place <BRK>that doesn t mean wilkins can t carve out a nice career for himself and make a big impact for his new team  though  i believe wherever he go  he is going to be productive and the fan will appreciate his effort if nothing else <BRK>however  drafting someone in the first round is supposed to mean something  for me  it mean you expect them to be more than just  good   you expect them to be one of the best at their position within about three year or so <BRK>wilkins is certainly a guy who can go out there and make all of the play an average nfl starting defensive lineman  should  make  i am just unsure about whether he can make the kind of play that only a handful of interior defensive linemen in the league can make   being able to make those rare play  to me  is what separate the great player from the good in the nfl  it is also what separate the guy i look at a first day pick  and the guy i think you can wait until the second or third day to select <BRK>i admit that evaluating wilkins after i already evaluated ed oliver from houston and quinnen williams from alabama didn t do him any favor  williams  in particular  is around the same size and wa deployed at alabama is a very similar way a wilkins wa at clemson  williams  play jumped off the screen at me a lot more than wilkins  did  however <BRK>i did realize while watching his film and before getting started on this column that i might have been unfairly judging wilkins by comparing him to williams  so i went back and watched his tape once more to try to make sure i wasn t  but who know <BRK>the thing is  wilkins doesn t have to be a good a williams for me to like him  williams is a fantatic prospect  but just like i didn t feel like williams had to reach aaron donald s level for me to appreciate his potential  wilkins didn t have to meaure up to williams for me to see his  either  oliver is a much different player than williams or donald  but it wa evident to me that he is a first round pick  too  i just didn t get the same vibe from wilkins a i did from williams and oliver on tape <BRK>however  let me reiterate  there wa a lot that i did like about wilkins on tape  he made some really nice play in those four game and he wa a tempo setter with his hustle  i just didn t see enough of those  uncommon  play that most college defensive tackle can t make in the four game that i watched  it is entirely possible that he had a shit ton of them in the game that i didn t watch  but i can t assume something i didn t actually see <BRK>wilkins will probably start a a rookie and play well in the nfl for close to a decade or more  hopefully  no matter where he is drafted  his new team s fan will appreciate him for who he is and not ridicule him for who he isn t  i think he is going to be a valuable addition to whichever team that draft him  and with that motor of his  he should become a franchise favorite in no time fat <BRK>but we all know how it go  a guy who would be praised for his exploit if he wa a second  or third round pick can end up getting labeled a  bust  if he is selected in the first round  unfortunately  all because of the ridiculously high expectation getting picked in the first round place on a prospect <BRK>he s a  safe  defensive line prospect who check all the box physically and can line up at multiple spot where he will play well against the run  there s a good chance he will be a better than average pa rusher  in my opinion  i like christian wilkins a a player  and  first rounder or not  i do believe he is going to make a ton of play over the course of his nfl career <BRK>for the purpose of this breakdown  i watched former clemson defensive lineman christian wilkins play against texas a m  boston college  duke  and alabama  those represented the second   th   th  and  th game on clemson s schedule last season  respectively <BRK>
