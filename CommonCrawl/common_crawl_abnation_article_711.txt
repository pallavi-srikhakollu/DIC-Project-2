   <BRK> that would also give another quarterback at the senior bowl a chance to rise up  the most likely candidate to do that is west virginia s will grier  he may not have the strongest arm  but he can place the ball over the top nicely and he s a decent athlete  more importantly  the stigma of coming from a wide open college system like west virginia is being diminished because of team like the los angeles ram  and the play of quarterback like patrick mahomes and baker mayfield  <BRK> buffalo quarterback tyree jackson is another quarterback to keep in mind this week  he meaured in at     and   pound  so he obviously get attention due to his size  he also may have the strongest arm of any quarterback in the draft  he wa a late senior bowl add after northwestern s clayton thorson pulled out due to an ankle injury  jackson is raw  but some team will love to take him on a a project  <BRK> montez sweat of mississippi state ha just about everything you want in a pas rusher  he measured at     and   pound and ha a wingspan of   inch  that s a box checked  twice  he wa productive in his two year with the bulldog  with     tackle for loss and   sack  check  he s a natural athlete who can hit the corner and create pressure consistently  check   <BRK> not only is sweat the best player at the senior bowl  but at some point you have to wonder if he s going to break into the top   of the draft  <BRK> montez sweat hesi bull   pic twitter com  taw ulvnx <BRK> there are a few standout offensive linemen to follow throughout the week  it must be said  though  that linemen can have tough week in mobile  after all  how frequently are they blocking in one on one situation like they do during the crucial practice   <BRK> anyway  the top blocker this week is arguably wahington state left tackle andre dillard  he started the week right with his weigh in  he came in at     and   pound  that matter because some thought he would come in at under   pound  which team could perceive a being too light  his arm length also hit   inch  which is a threshold number for some team at offensive tackle  yes  nfl team are that weird  dumb  and fickle about player size  <BRK> the other standout blocker to know this week is dalton risner of kansa state  a four year starter  risner will not blow people away with his athleticism or style  but more than anything  he s an aggressive blocker who just know how to beat a defender  he s versatile too  and team will look at him at just about every line spot   <BRK> at   pound  there are no size concern for boston college end zach allen  he s a really good run defender for an end  but he need to show a quicker first step and ability to get around the edge   <BRK> delaware safety nasir adderley is the top small school player at this year s senior bowl  and he s getting some first round buzz  still  this may not be a great week for him  immediately people will see his weigh in size at     and   pound and not think much of it  the senior bowl also isn t the best showcase for safety like adderley  he s not a safety who will star coming into the box and stopping the run  safety also don t get tested much during practice  but watch out if adderley get to show his range and ball tracking skill  that s where he excels  and why he s getting top   consideration  <BRK> perhaps the most impressive physical specimen at the senior bowl is stetson tight end donald parham  he officially meaured in at a little over     and and ha   inch arm  imagine the jump ball  he s only   pound  so he s kind of built like a gigantic wide receiver  but some team will love what they could turn him into a a three down tight end  and he look pretty natural in the the open field too  <BRK> stetson tight end donald parham is a gazelle   seniorbowl pic twitter com da yefzlcb <BRK> at     and   pound  alabama state offensive tackle tytus howard fit right in with his large fbs counterpart  but he s not just a size player  he ha good athleticism and quick foot for a bigger player  and he could stick at tackle in the nfl  this week is all about consistency and technique for howard  a he line up against more difficult opponent all week   <BRK> oh  and howard ha a decent story  too  he came to alabama state a a quarterback  before shifting to tight end and then offensive tackle  how many player can say that  <BRK> some player at the senior bowl played for the most prestigious team in college football  yet  they are being undersold going into the draft process   <BRK> the first player like this who come to mind is ohio state wide receiver terry mclaurin  he had his best season in   with   catch for   yard and   touchdown  the touchdown number is impressive  but the rest is just kind of decent because ohio state had a number of good receiver last season  mclaurin is a nice route runner and he s just a little bit fast  <BRK> top   fastest player today for north terry mclaurin  wr       corey ballentine  db       jordan brown  db       penny hart  wr       iman marshall  db         zebratechnology  seniorbowl <BRK> that s not all of mclaurin s value  though  he wa a crucial piece of ohio state s special team unit  and that carry value a a prospect  he s the type of player who will have a long and good nfl career  he may not have a superstar no    receiver kind of career  but a lot of team could benefit from having mclaurin on their roster  <BRK> in general  sometimes the draft isn t always about finding superstar  it can be about finding good player who fit a role  for instance  you can look at lsu tight end foster moreau s   catch    yard  and two touchdown lat seaon and dismiss him a a player  but he can go up and get the ball  and he ha decent speed and blocking ability  <BRK>  lsu te foster moreau with a nice grab over  miami db sheldrick redwine in  v  drill  pic twitter com nmylmi x k <BRK> moreau ha nice value on the third day of the draft a a second tight end who can do everything pretty well  <BRK>
