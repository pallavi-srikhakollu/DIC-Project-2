senior bowl week is here  and this is typically when draft rumor really start to fly  what wa asumed about the   nfl draft will change a word get out on what team really think about player   <BRK> this week s mock draft take a look at thing before the rumor mill take off and player start moving all around the place  there are also a couple quarterback who could sneak into the top   if they impress in the senior bowl  <BRK> bosa remains the player likely to be taken first overall in the draft  it s hard to see that changing unless arizona trade the pick  whether or not that should happen will be debated over the next few month   <BRK> it s difficult to move off this pick if bosa is gone  allen announced last week that he wa pulling out of the senior bowl  the last top five edge rusher to do that wa khalil mack in    that s probably allen s best comparison too  like mack  he can impact the game with his ability to pressure the quarterback and play three down   <BRK> a much a the jet need offensive line help  there are legitimate concern about whether there is one good enough for the third overall pick in the draft  if the jet doubt there is  they should take the best player available  which is williams  he didn t have the best national title game against clemson  but he can still dominate game  <BRK> the raider would love to see allen or williams available with their first pick  so much so  you have to wonder if they ll consider moving one of their extra first round pick this year to get an elite pressure defender  if they can t move up  holding at four could lead them to gary  he s a talented a player like williams or allen  but he never fully put it together at michigan  <BRK> two distinct narrative about williams have already formed early in the draft process  one is that williams is the best offensive tackle in the draft and a true technician  the other is that he s not particularly athletic and more likely to play guard in the nfl  if the latter end up being true  he won t be taken in the first five pick   <BRK> presumably  giant general manager dave gettleman is currently in the process of deciding if he want to draft a quarterback in the first round this year  it s a decision that will make or break gettleman a new york s top football executive  hakins is the best quarterback in this draft  but he could give gettleman pause  he s not overly experienced  and who know how he ll handle the drama of new york  but if gettleman want a rookie quarterback this offseaon  he may a well take the best one available   <BRK> there is no player who need a bigger senior bowl week than lock  the talented but inconsistent missouri quarterback  lock ha a big arm and athleticism  though he completed just     percent of his throw in four season for the tiger  if he ha a great week in mobile  he could elevate inside the top    <BRK> it seems like this pick should be a defensive end or a cornerback  if the lion use free agency to address end  taking williams at no    make sense  he s a ballhawk of a cornerback who make a lot of play  darius slay is an excellent cornerback for detroit  but the lion need help in the secondary  <BRK> the bill need to add talent to both side of the line  so this pick will likely be a player like oliver  mississippi state defensive tackle jeffery simmons  or oklahoma offensive tackle cody ford  oliver get the highest grade out of the three   <BRK> jones  like lock  need a great week at the senior bowl to get quite this high  is this too high for him and lock  maybe  but team can press to get a quarterback  especially at the low price on a rookie contract for five year    <BRK> right tackle is sneakily a big need for the bengal  this pick ha often been lsu linebacker devin white  but the truth is  an offensive tackle ha much greater roster value than a linebacker  ford is a powerful blocker who will open up hole in the run game and help keep andy dalton clean  <BRK> polite is the player the packer need to get in the first round  he s just behind allen in term of versatile edge rusher in this draft  polite is speed and aggression around the corner  which is the type of player the packer sorely lack  <BRK> murray landing here is le about his ability  and more about the team drafting ahead of miami that need a quarterback  would tom coughlin in jacksonville  john elway in denver  and gettleman in new york really consider an undersized and athletic quarterback over a traditional pocket thrower  maybe not  that could lead murray to miami  <BRK> if oliver is gone  the falcon will have plenty of good option at defensive tackle  simmons ha the strength to bull rush his way through the offensive line  but he also posse a decent array of move so he s not always relying on his power   <BRK> there are a number area washington could address with the no    pick  cornerback is one of them  and murphy is pro ready corner thanks to his instinct and ability to play the ball in the air   <BRK> the panther would be happy to see ferrell last this long in the draft  he would immediately be the team s best defensive end and help improve a lackluster pas rush   <BRK> by the end of last season  cleveland s group of starting defensive linemen wore out due to overuse  that wa particularly true for tackle larry ogunjobi  wilkins can line up next to ogunjobi and take some of the pressure off of him   <BRK> the viking need to hit on some pick this draft to really get into contention in the nfc  one thing holding minnesota back ha been subpar offensive line play  taylor is a standout run blocker who could get looked at either at tackle or on the inside   <BRK> this is another holdover pick from lat week s mock draft  it wa enticing to go with oklahoma wide receiver marquise brown a a field stretcher for tennessee  but an edge player is just a big of a need  burn may be a little lean  but if he can bulk up he ll be an effective pas rusher who can stand up or play with his hand in the ground  <BRK> because ryan shazier s future is still unknown  the steelers could turn to the draft to get a linebacker  white isn t quite the player roquan smith wa in last year s draft  but he s close  white excels at finding the ball carrier and making strong tackle   <BRK> seahawks tight end will dissly is working his way back from a torn patellar tendon  and it wa clear how much he wa missed last season  even if he come back fully healthy  the seahawks need to get better at the position  the project of moving george fant from tackle to tight end should be over  and the rest of the depth is average  hockenson is the draft s top tight end who is a capable blocker and pas catcher  <BRK> alabama safety deionte thompson is an intriguing option here  but the raven may have to put a lot of work into their wide receiver group  leading receiver john brown is a free agent  willie snead is locked in a a slot only player  and michael crabtree is just average  metcalf can be a star no    wideout for lamar jackson  <BRK> it s evident that houston need to add talent in the secondary  and mullen can be a difference maker  he ha size at     and just under   pound  and is decent enough at making a play on the ball  more importantly  he ha speed  and that s something houston is desperately need at cornerback  <BRK> the raider badly need speed at wide receiver to help take the top off defense  that is brown s specialty when he s healthy  to some degree  he can be for derek carr what tyreek hill is for patrick mahomes  <BRK> jason peter turn   this week  and time is running out on his outstanding career  it would be smart of the eagle to draft his replacement now and make sure he s ready to go  little is a classic left tackle with size and athleticism to mirror speed rusher and the edge  <BRK> the colt need an interior defensive lineman who is capable of getting through gap and creating pressure up the middle  considering that is jones  specialty  it s hard not to like this fit in the first round  the indianapolis defense under matt eberflus ha bit of the old tampa   mixed into it  and that scheme wa reliant on defensive tackle who could split gap  jones can be that player for the colt  defensive coordinator   <BRK> bush would give the raider speed at linebacker they just don t have  he s not the biggest linebacker at under      but he fly around the field  can cover  and can be used occasionally on the blitz   <BRK> it s been hard to find a spot for lawrence in the first round of mock draft  masive run stuffing defensive tackle don t carry a much value in today s nfl  he doe  however  fit in los angeles considering how many defensive linemen are free agent for the charger  <BRK> a it stand right now  jacob is the only running back worth a first round pick this year  even that is debatable  but the chief can t go into next seaon with their current running back situation the way it is  jacob can take some of the pressure off patrick mahomes and help the team grind out game  <BRK> that s right  the packer doubling up on pas rusher in the first round again  this time it s because sweat is just too good to let fall out of the first round  like polite  he can play standing up or with his hand down  the combination of the two would open up a number of possibility for defensive coordinator mike pettine  <BRK> meet your rob gronkowski successor  fant excels when he s lined up outside working up the sideline  but he s also capable of playing the middle of the field gaining tough yard  he s not the best blocker  but he would give the patriot a big target a a receiver  <BRK> like sweat  thompson is too good to let fall out of the first round  he s an excellent coverage safety  especially when he can patrol the deep middle of the field  he can also come down and play the slot when needed   <BRK>  <BRK>
