out of nowhere  triple h announced that nxt champion tommaso ciampa  nxt north american champion johnny gargano  ricochet  and aleister black would be making their debut on monday night raw during this week s episode  each of them were introduced with a video package and some notable context from michael cole  it felt very sporting  like a scouting report to bring the more casual fan up to speed on just who these guy are and why they re worth tuning in for  they all went out and won the night  beating established player all up and down the card <BRK>there were immediately question regarding whether or not this qualified a a  main roster call up  and it sound like they ll be sticking around on raw to some degree  but considering two of them are still champion in nxt  they ll also clearly still be doing work for the yellow brand <BRK>meanwhile  on the very same show  it wa announced that bayley   sasha bank  the new woman s tag team champion  will be defending those title on not just raw and smackdown but also in nxt  that  of course  doesn t indicate they are being demoted to nxt any more than  say  ciampa appearing on raw mean he s being promoted to it  really  it seems to be more of an indication that the territory system triple h ha long championed is finally here <BRK>it make all the sense in the world that wwe  with it extensive roster of talent and not enough space for all of them  would send some star to other brand to freshen thing up from time to time  really  it doesn t happen often enough  sure  they do the superstar shakeup once a year  but appearance from various star across the different brand shouldn t be the exception but the norm <BRK>of course  it s entirely possible vince mcmahon change his mind and they don t actually go full bore with this idea  but they ve already done enough to show that it s viable <BRK> even if the crowd in louisiana this week never seemed to get all that into what wwe had to offer  <BRK>i  for one  am looking forward to where they go with this and excited for the possibility <BRK>
