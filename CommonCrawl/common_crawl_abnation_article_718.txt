the virginia cavalier are the most tortured ncaa tournament team of this era  the hoos have been one of college basketball s elite team for a solid six year now  notching a no    or   seed in the big dance five time  but they ve lost shy of the final four every year so far and only made the elite eight once  in    they became the first top seed to lose to a no     singlehandedly making  umbc  into something people outside maryland have heard of  <BRK> explanation vary for why uva ha struggled so miserably in the tournament  one theory go that the tournament is a big crapshoot  and there s nothing special about uva s futility  another go that uva  which play offense at a glacial pace  is unable to step on the gas and catch up when it fall behind a hot shooting opponent  maybe one of those is the truth  and maybe neither is  i m not here to litigate the last half decade  <BRK> in    tony bennett s team is a good a ever  actually  it might be better than ever  the hoos are no    in ken pomeroy s adjusted efficiency ranking  something they ve never been before  their offense  long good but rarely great  ha actually ranked a tick higher than their typically all world defense  a a no    seed again  they ve got all the marker of a final four team  except that they re virginia and we re all used to them messing up before that   <BRK> fivethirtyeight s predictive model say uva ha a   percent chance to reach the final four  a such  there s a   percent chance it doesn t  and that doesn t account for the hoos  extreme virginia ness  so  i present every other team in the south region of the tournament  ranked by how likely it is to devatate the hoos before the final four again   <BRK> the vols have one of the best offense in the country  and they could make enough shot over bennett s pack line defense to beat virginia even if the hoos don t play badly   <BRK> the badger   formerly coached by bennett s dad  dick  and the program with an identity most similar to virginia s   could get the hoos in the sweet    if that happens  virginia will be playing a team with a defense just a good a it own  uva ha a couple of possible answer for uw star ethan happ  but the badger could make enough shot and create a cold enough hoos shooting day to bring more sadness to bennett s team   <BRK> the boilermakers score a ton of point  virginia could go cold  a it s done in tournament loss every other year  and that could be all that s needed   <BRK> the wildcat have a great defense  which brings up the same generic concern about uva s offense stalling out for long stretch  especially if it fall behind  on another hand  k state s strength is forcing turnover  and uva doesn t give the ball up a lot   <BRK> there s a fine chance the defending national champion lose in the first round to saint mary s  but if jay wright s team get rolling  with all it big time tournament experience and it still dangerous offense  it s not hard to envision a problem for the hoos   <BRK> one of them s going to get to play uva in the second round  i am not about to pretend any number of thing couldn t go wrong and lead to the hoos losing to either of them   <BRK> the duck should lose to wisconsin  but if they happen to be this year s cinderella  th seed  they could get a shot at uva in the sweet     <BRK> it feel highly unlikely the anteater will get a shot at uva  but if they do  they re a potential problem  they have the no    defense in division i by effective field goal percentage  they are highly conducive to opponent having bad shooting night   <BRK> both are decent  neither s likely to get to play virginia at any point   <BRK> the gael probably won t get a chance at the hoos  and they re not good enough at any one thing to seem like a particular threat if they do   <BRK> the runnin  bulldog are guaranteed a shot at virginia  and that put them above some others  who won t get that chance  you are free to attach whatever level of significance you want to uva having lost to umbc lat year  and also to bet a much money a you want on an outcome that s probably not going to happen again for many year  if ever   <BRK> no  <BRK> no  <BRK>
