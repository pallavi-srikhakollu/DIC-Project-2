  <BRK>this is the nature of the business  and everyone involved is making a hefty salary they ve deemed is worth the risk on the table  but lillard s admission that he d have to live knowing his decision caused the ensuing chaos reveals the double edged sword of player power  ring chasing isn t worth that weight right now to him <BRK> i do want to win a championship   lillard said   but there s other stuff that mean more to me  it s almost like i m not willing to sell myself out for that instead of impacting this  <BRK>the way lillard prioritizes value off the floor is what make him such a unique star  and it s why he s so beloved in portland  <BRK>
