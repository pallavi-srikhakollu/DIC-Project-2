after mississippi state wa named the no    seed in the ncaa woman s basketball tournament s portland region  bulldog head coach vic schaefer   with guard jazzmun holmes and jordan danberry seated next to him   said during the team s selection monday press conference  <BRK>the commitment college and university are making to woman s basketball   they re seeing that when you make an investment you re going to get a return <BRK>what the college and university now understand and back with dollar and sense  pun intended   the rest of the sport world   especially mainstream sport medium   refuse to acknowledge  <BRK>refuse  because it is hard to attribute a trait like ignorance to a multi million dollar company like espn  which refuse to invest equitably in it coverage of woman s sport <BRK>hour before the ncaaw tournament selection show wa set to air on espn  yesterday  the bracket wa leaked on espnu  <BRK>espn acknowledged  via twitter  that the bracket  wa mistakenly posted on espnu  and stated   we deeply regret the the error and extend our apology to the ncaa and the woman s basketball community  <BRK>espn statement regarding the ncaa woman s tournament bracket http   t co npwbmodcv  pic twitter com zffgxi btx<BRK>the network s apology sat well with no one  <BRK>athlete  coach and team worked hard all year for this big moment  school had organized viewing party  so  once the genie wa out of the bottle  there wa no way to stuff it back in  and wahington mystic guard natasha cloud  for one  sounded off in a series of apropos tweet <BRK>am i the only one that is pissed the selection got  leaked  for the woman s tournament   this would never happen with the men  also how much money did school program just waste planning a special viewing party for their fan  also the lack of viewership for the actual show <BRK>shit would never happen on the men s side  i m pissed  how do you accidentally post that   nahhh that wa purposeful <BRK>alssssoooo these phenomenal woman work their ass off all season long for this special moment  ruined <BRK>sabrina ionescu  who will be competing in this year s ncaaw tournament for the no    seed oregon duck in the portland region also shared thought about espn s debacle  which cloud retweeted  <BRK>so  espnu is gonna leak the bracket and then proceed to ruin everyone s selection show party by changing the time      go duck am i right  <BRK>the selection show wa moved up to   p m  et  from   p m  et   at the start of the early broadcast  espn s maria taylor read a statement acknowledging the error  apologizing to the ncaa on espn s behalf and expressing that an investigation will be conducted into how this happened    <BRK>any  investigation  must go beyond the mayhem espn created yesterday and focus on the overall culture of the network which remains entrenched in a commitment to ostracizing  marginalizing and suppressing coverage of woman s sport  this will only change if parent company disney installs a leader at the top who is committed to reversing the ongoing  pervasive gender based discrimination by which espn is now defined <BRK>after all  when kate fagan resigned from espn last year after seven year with the network  she stated in an interview with the washington post <BRK>to continue at espn i would have to be immersed in the day to day in sport  and i found myself more and more interested in other aspect of sport   like how it connects to our culture  that wa not going to be the big business of espn <BRK>another visible espn personality to resign over what amount to issue with the network s content commitment and culture is jemele hill  <BRK>she wa reprimanded by the network for the political comment she posted on twitter but stated in an interview with the hollywood reporter that she and mike smith  with whom she hosted various program over the year  received backlash from the network long before donald trump became president  stating  <BRK>mike  smith  and i specifically were called political  way before any of the trump stuff ever happened  and i always thought that wa a very interesting label  because frankly  i think that most of the time it wa said because we were the two black people <BRK>it wasn t our fault that chance the rapper decided to wear a colin kaepernick t shirt and say that he wasn t supporting the nfl  we didn t have him on the show for that  we had him on the show to talk about him being in vega for mayweather mcgregor  but because you have the two black people that are outspoken  with another outspoken black artist  suddenly the show is too political <BRK>of his decision to offer hill a position at the atlantic after her departure from espn  atlantic editor in chief jeffrey goldberg said <BRK>put it this way  my journalistic interest are somewhat different than disney s  let me be diplomatic  i m not sure that  a a consumer of espn product  i m not sure that espn is particularly interested  especially in television  in standing at the intersection of sport and culture and race and gender and politics  it can be a pretty dangerous corner for some people  but that s exactly the intersection that i want to be at <BRK>i like having journalist on our staff who make all sort of useful trouble  and jemele  i believe  will make all sort of useful trouble <BRK>refusing to address issue  at the intersection of sport and culture and race and gender and politics    just pretending all of those issue don t exist   era woman from conversation because woman are most often affected by these issue in the world of sport  so  once issue concerning woman are erased  woman are erased  too   by omission  <BRK>if espn cover woman s sport a equitably a it cover men s sport  it would be forced to address bigger issue surrounding woman in sport  because espn doe not want to delve into those issue at all  sweep those issue under the rug while keeping coverage of woman s sport limited  <BRK>so  with inequitable investment of time  resource and attention toward woman s sport   when woman s sport  and  therefore  woman  are treated like an afterthought   we end up with the inexcusable and deflating experience of a bracket leaking hour early  and all the consequence that come along with it  thus  espn s apology mean nothing unless the network fundamentally address the issue which make discriminating against woman part of it business plan  <BRK>a cloud stated via twitter  this  would never happen on the men s side  <BRK>we all have something to fight for  something that call u to lead  the question is  how will you get it done   captain marvel<BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK>
