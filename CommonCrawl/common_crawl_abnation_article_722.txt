zion williamson s injury against unc on wednesday night wa one of the most significant sport injury i have ever seen  and i only say  one of  a a hedge  racking my brain  i can t think of anything bigger  some were more shocking  or more gruesome  or  hopefully  longer term  even in the worst cae scenario  say a seaon ending acl tear  williamson may still be the no    overall pick in the nba draft  <BRK>but even if williamson isn t affected by this  we have been  and certainly no one could possibly look at the ncaa or sport a a whole in the same way  the way this injury occurred  and to who  and where  and when  and how  may have forever altered how we talk about athlete <BRK>shoe blowout happen  there wa seemingly an nba epidemic of them in    i couldn t find another high profile instance in the college or pro game since then  but i m sure there have been some  <BRK>but not nearly enough to make what happened wednesday anything le than flooring  and of course  if there wa anyone who could bust out of a nike it wa williamson  a player of superhero level of talent and athleticism  <BRK>yes  this absolutely should add to the running list of thing that constitute the legend of zion  this is now the time zion wa so strong and quick he exploded his shoe forever and always  this is branded into your brain now <BRK>let s talk more about  williamson  a player of superhero level of talent and athleticism   i remember when my very good colleague ricky o donnell wrote this story about williamson s dunking prowess in high school  he wa talked down from the headline  zion williamson is already one of the best dunker of all time   by slack room consensus  it wa deemed a step too far  williamson had just  by a matter of day  turned   year old <BRK>williamson is already one of the best dunker of all time  and guess what  dunking isn t even what he s best at  hat tip to ricky once again   heading into williamson s freshman year at duke  there wa no question about his potential  but plenty of question about how a player of his unique build   at        pound  he d already be the second heaviest player in the nba   and limited shooting capability would fit in the nba  he wa projected to go no    overall in sb nation s way too early   mock draft last june <BRK>today  there s no question he would go no    if healthy  he ha answered  emphatically  that yes  he really move that quick for a man that size  and that he shoot more than serviceably enough  like      percent from two type of serviceably  to make him a menace in almost every facet of basketball  <BRK>the average ticket price for duke unc wa more than       making it the hottest ticket ever in the history of one of the greatest rivalry in sport  darren rovell  sport  dweeby unofficial cataloguer of brand and excess  laid out the horrible detail  <BRK>      what someone paid on stubhub for four ticket   row off floor tonight at cameron indoor  the face value of the ticket combined wa    <BRK>a ticket broker told me today that zion williamson alone added      to each ticket bought on the secondary market  he ha  so far missed  half of the first half <BRK>the matchup drew a star studded crowd headlined by former president barack obama  but also featuring spike lee  ken griffey jr   and more  williamson s game have drawn lebron james and jay z in the past  too  likely in connection to a forthcoming battle to represent the phenom during his professional career  <BRK>that s a lot of money and attention generated by one man who  i shouldn t have to remind you  is playing for free  the ncaa cleared a billion dollar in revenue in    largely thanks to a tv contract for the ncaa men s basketball tournament  the championship tournament for the league that williamson play in  a league that williamson only play in because the ncaa and nba colluded a long time ago to implement the one and done rule  which needlessly and recklessly keep basketball player from signing with an nba team until they are at least   year old  williamson wa forced to make the choice between doing an unpaid year of high profile work or playing overseas before beginning an inevitable career playing with the world s best <BRK>college athlete should have been getting paid a long time ago  and in the whole sordid history of college athletics  perhaps no player ha deserved to get paid a much a williamson doe  if you watched wednesday s game  you d be cruel to deny that     <BRK>pay zion  pay all them  pay them their goddamn money  <BRK>i saw it  you saw it  and if you didn t see it  you ll be hearing about it so much that you re liable to forget  year down the road  that you never actually saw it  <BRK>so there s no hiding  then  if anyone still get aghast at the idea of williamson resting the rest of the season to preserve his body for the pro  or that college football player probably should sometimes sit out bowl game  or for any reason still cling to the destructive idea that amateurism is good or wholesome  then screw them  <BRK>if they saw the most jaw dropping athlete of our life get hurt for no rhyme or reason   and they did   in a game that many people except him were making money on  then screw them <BRK>let these kid go straight out of h    too much on the line to be messing with college if you got a legit chance to turn pro  one injury can change somebody career   zion sit yo as down lol and we will be ready for you in the big boy league  lookingoutfortheplayers<BRK>no one should actually give a crap about the fact that zion ripped through nike a few month before he s set to sign one of the richest shoe deal ever  they should only care long enough to have a nice long point and laugh at a corporate behemoth that leverage the likeness and work of athlete to sell thing <BRK>a freak accident can occur at any time  in any place  but it shouldn t occur like this  to a future megastar who wa nonetheless in the midst of being exploited  <BRK>it s hard to tell whether we talk about that rampant exploitation   not jut of williamson  but of countless athlete   too much or too little  paying the damn player isn t a novel concept  and no one want to be the one person constantly bringing down a good time for everyone  but then  night like wednesday show u that becaue of the the hype and thrill and fun and possibility of sport  it s a jarring a ever that still nothing ha been done to fix the broken part  <BRK>if williamson sat out the rest of the season  even if he wa healthy enough to return next game  no one could be heartless enough to blame him  and if we can come to a consensus that we should be sympathetic in this case  then it ought to be a slippery slope to extend that sympathy on down the line of endless case of young athlete being used <BRK>ought to be isn t the same a will be  but whatever you believe  you ll have to reckon with williamson eventually  remember that  the time zion wa so strong and quick he exploded his shoe  of course you do  and you shouldn t forget it even if you ever could <BRK><BRK>
