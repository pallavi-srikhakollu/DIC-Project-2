after   win in a row i got my title shot  but when i became champion there were no instruction on what to do next  i had to figure out what it meant to me  how to represent my team and my community  how to express my value a a martial artist  how to be a good father to my son while trying to entertain fan  i m still figuring it out every day but i looked to gsp to create a blueprint for myself on

retraite  georgesstpierre    oldschool  mma  gsp  rush  ufc   à montreal  quebec http   t co rf bqeufg  <BRK> i wa lucky enough to officiate   of  georgesstpierre fight in the octagon including his first championship fight and his last  gsp it wa always an honor to work your fight   i hope you dominate retirement just like you dominated the  ufc cage   thank you for being a class act <BRK>  a study in greatness  the most important people in our life are those who give u an example of what is possible so that we can lift ourselves higher  they don t give u thing  they give u ideal  and those ideal can move u from within to become better people  george st pierre wa the single greatest example of a positive athletic role model i ever met in my career  every dojo or training partner he walked into or befriended wa lifted by his appearance  starting off a an unknown youngster from quebec  he fought his way to the top of the fight world toughest division and beat the best of three generation of welterweight and then came back from an initial retirement to win the title at middleweight  along the way he exhibited the highest standard of character and professionalism in an often wild sport  he uhered in the modern era of professionalism in preparation for mma athlete to replace the traditional martial art methodology ued by previou generation of competitor  nobody did more to elevate the standing of the sport in the public eye a it grew from it bloodsport beginning into the most popular combat sport in the world  he wa an innovator who staked his career on the paradigm shift from single style specialist to what he stood for   integrated skill where the primary emphais wa on the interface between skill set rather than over emphais on any one skill set  this enabled him to outwrestle wrestler  outstrike striker and dominate jiu jitu champion on the floor   he wa not the best at any one of those skill   he wa the best at integrating them with a speed and direction that no one could keep up with  he defeated all his opponent  dominated every re match he ever took and shut down the toughest opponent to a degree what wa utterly atounding  it wa the greatest privilege of my coaching career to be a small part of this great man acent to the top of martial art  through all the time i knew him and i have no doubt all the way into the future   he wa a martial artist first and an mma athlete second  this made him a perpetual student  a generou teacher and a truly noble fighter  thank you  george  from all of u <BRK> a post shared by  john danaher
