so  you think kyler murray s going to struggle in the nfl because he s short   <BRK>some people think so  based on murray s listed     frame  being that short put murray at risk of having lot of pass batted down at the line of scrimmage  one thought go  or maybe he just won t be able to see over the head of his offensive linemen  <BRK>what happens if he get drafted by  say  the jaguar  he ll see j j  watt and jadeveon clowney twice a year  both have   inch arm  long  even by nfl standard  and stand over      <BRK>but the fear about murray s height doesn t square with the reality of his game or quarterbacking in general  consider these number from    <BRK>listed at      by  ou_football   thekylermurray had   pass batted down last season per  pff  that s tied for the fewest among the   qb in  movethesticks top   prospect  the other   are all listed at      or taller  pic twitter com bqqiskruzp<BRK>jones is a listed      lock      and haskins      murray  again  is      and        <BRK>here it is  the  nflcombine measurement that so many have been waiting for  oklahoma qb kyler murrayheight         weight   hand       arm       wingspan       <BRK>for starter  batted pass are most likely to happen on short throw <BRK>the target is closer  so the initial angle of the ball isn t a high a if you d need to drive the ball   yard in the air  asuming the same velocity for each throw  that s just geometry  <BRK>just lobbing the ball on every throw could get rid of batting concern  but in football  there are variable  like   pound linemen chaing you and hole in a defense opening and closing quickly  the ball sometimes ha to get where it s going fast  so the throw come out flat and low <BRK>of murray s five batted pass in    per pro football focus  i ve grabbed three  all were underneath throw murray only had to get to travel maybe   or   yard in the air  <BRK>here s one against ucla  <BRK>and one against alabama <BRK>and a different one against ucla that s in super slow mo to illustrate something <BRK>notice the defensive lineman who blocked this lat one  he started moving his hand  white glove on the left  a murray wound up  he anticipated the throw  did this pas get blocked because murray s short  or wa it blocked because ucla s keisean lucier south is      ha really long arm  and knew what wa coming  he knocked the pas down with his wrist  if murray were a few inch taller  the ball probably still would ve been batted  <BRK>on another hand  why didn t this pas get batted  <BRK>murray had an fau defensive lineman  who s at least three inch taller than him  in closer proximity than any those guy who actually batted down his pass  <BRK>but murray wa throwing deep   something he s known to do well   and the launch angle nullified whatever disadvantage might have existed because of his height  <BRK>in   season  russell wilson ha never had double digit batted pass  never in top    nfl leader in each of his season          weeden          henne           tannehill          bortles      bortles          stafford          cousin  http   t co qnfjhjcn u<BRK>that list doesn t account for total attempt  but look at kirk cousin  who s listed at     and had     percent of his   pass batted  in one game against the cardinal  he had six  cousin  height didn t help him when a player two inch shorter blocked this short throw  <BRK>his height didn t help him on this short throw  either  after two of his linemen got split  <BRK>height didn t help josh rosen   who s listed a an inch taller than cousin  at       get this short pas over a defender  <BRK>being     didn t help blake bortles   who s routinely on the list of qbs with the most batted ball   when he threw a ball off his own     lineman s helmet  leading to a pick  <BRK>some of bortles  problem have had to do with inconsistent mechanic and bad throwing platform  well  murray s a baseball player with picturesque throwing mechanic  <BRK>at oklahoma  murray played behind an offensive line that averaged        standard for a college lineman and about an inch shorter than nfl average   so no worry on that front  <BRK>there are way qbs can try to loft pass with touch to get the job done  murray can do that  <BRK>but there are other scenario that only call for a bullet  when you re trying to fit the ball into a tight window with a defender bearing down on your target  <BRK>if you re throwing short and a pas rusher is in the lane  the ball s just going to get tipped sometimes  it s even le avoidable if a qb is a borderline statue in the pocket  which you might notice is a theme of nfl qbs who have a lot of pases batted  <BRK>if you know anything about murray s play  he is very much not a statue  he s known for taking off on some electric run  but even his movement inside the pocket creates new passing lane  a     former teammate of his at oklahoma can do that  too  <BRK>baker mayfield had a total of five pass batted down over the past three year starting  josh rosen had   batted at the line this year alone too short tbh amirite  <BRK>and occasionally  having a slightly lower release point could lead to it  <BRK>but expecting murray to struggle in particular with batted ball is an example of a red herring about qb play that need to die <BRK>
