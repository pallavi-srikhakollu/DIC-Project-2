and lo  the ufc s espn era is upon u <BRK>in somewhat of a fun house mirror reflection of the ufc s debut on fox back in november   that saw heavyweight cain velasquez defend his title against junior do santos in the main event  saturday s espn  debut card will be headlined by two fighter competing in the promotion s smallest division  flyweight champion henry cejudo and challenger t j  dillashaw <BRK>this champion v  champion matchup   dillashaw is in his second reign with the bantamweight title   won t be airing on television  instead it will be the first carrot dangled in front of fight fan to convince them to subscribe to the espn  streaming service  however  there will be a four fight preliminary portion on espn headlined by lightweight donald cerrone and alexander hernandez <BRK>on the main card  former nfl player turned heavyweight prospect greg hardy make his debut against allen crowder in the co headliner  unbeaten lightweight gregor gillespie take on all action fighter yancy medeiros  two time flyweight title challenger joseph benavidez fight the streaking dustin ortiz  paige vanzant and rachael ostovich meet in a flyweight encounter  and light heavyweight veteran glover teixeira fight short notice replacement karl roberson <BRK>what  ufc brooklyn<BRK>where  barclays center in brooklyn<BRK>when  saturday  jan     the three fight espn  early preliminary card begin at   p m  et  the four fight espn preliminary card begin at   p m  et  and the six fight espn  main card begin at   p m  et <BRK>whether you put much stock in the eye test or not  basic logic dictate that t j  dillashaw will not be the same fighter he is at bantamweight after having to cut an extra   pound to challenge cejudo  the question is how much this drop will deplete him and to what degree that might affect his performance <BRK>because if this fight were at   pound  dillashaw would be the clear favorite  a thinned out version of him should still be good enough to do the job and he looked healthy enough at friday s weigh in  coming in at a lean     pound <BRK>dillahaw will be the taller  longer athlete on fight night  and he won t be giving up much in the speed department  his rapid movement and agility have always been strength  and he should have more pop in the standup a well  cejudo is greatly improved a a boxer since making his mma debut almost six year ago  but any extended action on the foot is going to tilt towards his opponent <BRK>that leaf cejudo s wrestling a the one area where he ll have a distinct advantage  a cliche a it is to talk about how a strong wrestler can dictate where the fight go  that s a major key to a cejudo victory  the more he mix it up and keep dillahaw off balance  the better chance he ha of getting this one to the end of the fifth round ahead on the scorecard <BRK>dillahaw ha a wrestling background too  one that s not even in the same universe a cejudo s a far a accomplishment  but when it come to making use of it in the octagon he s a good a anyone in the lighter weight clases  even if he strictly wrestle defensively  it should be enough to neutralize that part of cejudo s game plan <BRK>this is bad news for people tired of  champ champ  and anyone who fear that a dillashaw win signal the end of the flyweight division  it could end with a bang though  in this case a flurry of dillashaw strike <BRK>pick  dillashaw<BRK>there might be controversy surrounding greg hardy s pat  but a far a in cage prospect go his future is looking bright  the fact is that there simply aren t a lot of heavyweight with his natural power and athleticism  that point ha been repeated ad nauseum by anyone who s talked about hardy s upside because it s true  he move fat and he hit hard  exactly what you d expect from a guy who wa able to compete at a high level in the nfl <BRK>what crowder brings to the table is decent fight iq and enough grappling to get by  which may sound like a backhanded compliment  but considering that hardy s grappling game is completely untested so far  crowder s work in the clinch and ability to set up takedown could help him steal a win here  a impressive a hardy ha looked  once you get to the ufc it a whole different story and it entirely possible that he ha no idea what to do once he s put on his back and he end up laying a goose egg <BRK>but just looking at this from a matchmaking perspective  official couldn t have done a better job of giving hardy a beatable fighter with a respectable looking record  crowder doesn t have the physical gift to keep up with the former defensive end and that s going to spell disaster for him and a lot of the opponent that hardy is likely to face in the early stage of his ufc career <BRK>pick  hardy<BRK>gregor gillespie is one of the biggest favorite on the main card and justifiably so  with his deep gas tank  overwhelming wrestling ability  and nose for the finish  he ha all the making of a future contender at   pound  yancy medeiros will be his biggest test yet  an effective brawler with good reach who is difficult to put away <BRK>this is the definition of a step up fight for gillespie  who is already     against the lower tier of the ufc lightweight division  that s no disrespect to his opponent  all of whom sported solid record before gillespie ran through them  his most recent victory came against vinc pichel  who wa on a four fight win streak <BRK>it s been a while since medeiros ha fought a specialist like gillespie and while he s fairly adept at matching his opponent skill for skill  if gillespie want to ground him and keep him there  medeiros won t have much say in the matter <BRK>i actually like this one to go all three round  which will be only the third time that one of gillespie s opponent make it to the scorecard  the outcome will be the same though  another win for  the gift  <BRK>pick  gillespie<BRK>it s been over four year since joseph benavidez won a convincing unanimous decision over dustin ortiz  and ortiz ha only recently got back to the winning way that once had him entrenched in the top   of the flyweight ranking  a knee injury cost the   year old benavidez a chunk of his career  but he didn t look like he d lost much of a step in a close split decision loss to sergio pettis and a thrilling first round tko of alex perez  long renowned for being one of the few  er with consistent knockout power  benavidez will get a second chance to finish ortiz on saturday <BRK>a high paced bout suit ortiz just fine  he is extraordinarily difficult to finish  with zero ko loss and just one loss by submission on his resume  and even in that instance he only stayed down after being choked nearly unconscious  the result may not always reflect it  but ortiz is a more complete fighter since losing to benavidez and a legitimate threat to become just the second fighter to stop benavidez inside the distance <BRK>fight between elite flyweight tend to be coin toss  however  given what we saw in their first fight  so long a you don t think benavidez is experiencing a significant decline or that ortiz ha made some quantum leap in his capability  there s reaon to expect a similar outcome in this rematch  look for benavidez to consistently beat ortiz to the punch en route to another decision nod <BRK>pick  benavidez<BRK>paige vanzant ha looked like anything but a world beater in her last three loss  and it s easy to point out where thing went wrong for her  she dropped a decision to jessica rose clark after breaking her arm in the second round  wa choked out by the more experienced and submission savvy michelle waterson  and just outclassed in every conceivable way by future champion rose namajunas <BRK>so why is it a smart bet to pick her to beat rachael ostovich <BRK>nobody will question ostovich s toughness a she brings that trademark hawaiian spirit to the cage every time  the problem is that she doesn t have a standout skill with which to give vanzant any serious problem  her best bet is to take the springy vanzant down  otherwise this will become a kickboxing match that    gauge  will be right at home in  mix in a healthy dose of scrambling to avoid ostovich s takedown and this one should go vanzant s way <BRK>pick  vanzant<BRK>instead of a fight that could get him back on the contender track  glover teixeira find himself in matchup with little to gain  the one time light heavyweight title challenger wa scheduled to fight ion cutelaba  only to lose that opponent to injury and instead face middleweight karl roberson <BRK>a dana white tuesday night contender s series signee  roberson is a lethal finisher who ha competed at light heavyweight before  in fact  the last time two time he fought at   pound  he won by   second ko and   second submission  teixeira ha to be cautious <BRK>given that roberson is such a wild card in this situation  expect teixeira to close the distance with strike and look to grapple early to wear roberson down  from there  he ll drag roberson to the mat and set up a submission with his overlooked jiu jitsu skill <BRK>beating teixeira is a tall task under ideal circumstance  on short notice  roberson can t be blamed if this fight end with him tapping out <BRK>pick  teixeira<BRK>undercard<BRK>donald cerrone def  alexander hernandez<BRK>ariane lipski def  joanne calderwood<BRK>vinicius moreira def  alonzo
