if you all ever wondered why i release bracket on tuesday instead of on monday  last night s action explained why   <BRK> while the four no    seed in today s projection are the same a lat week s  the order is radically different thanks to the  admittedly shorthanded  duke blue devil  home defeat at the hand of the syracuse orange in the first game of espn s big monday doubleheader  that result pushed the nation s two remaining undefeated team  the michigan wolverine  south  and virginia cavalier  eat  into the top two spot  with the tennessee volunteer  midwest  and duke  west  rounding out the quartet   <BRK> but seismic change could be on the way over the next seven day  that s because the cavalier host in state rival virginia tech tonight    p m   raycom espn   before traveling to durham on saturday    p m   espn   a for the wolverine  they have a few day to prepare for a saturday road test at wisconsin badger    p m   espn   <BRK> that mean the right combination of result could push the lead contender from seed line no    to an anchor spot next tuesday  the gonzaga bulldog and michigan state spartan are best positioned to make the leap with the kansa jayhawks a step behind the top six  then there are the texas tech red raider  a new two seed thanks to their     big   start  chris beard s team replaces the kentucky wildcat  who find themselves on line no    alongside the returning oklahoma sooner and houston cougar and a virginia tech squad bumped up from the four line  <BRK> the acc s two three seed of a week ago  the florida state seminole and north carolina tar heel  dropped after experiencing very different home loss on saturday   the seminole to duke on a buzzer beater and the tar heel in blowout fashion to louisville  while tar heel are a four seed today alongside the markus howard powered marquette golden eagle  buffalo bull and auburn tiger  the seminole fell all the way to a five  thanks to a monday loss at resurgent pittsburgh  note that mac leading buffalo s long term prospect for remaining among the top   are limited because of the number of power conference squad in the race    <BRK> after today s full bracket  i ll take

<BRK> thanks to syracuse s upset win lat night  there are just two new at large entrant in today s field  a the mississippi rebel and temple owl replace the creighton bluejays and san francisco don   the vcu ram dropped out thanks to the addition of the ucf knight a the american athletic s leader   while fran dunphy s owl find themselves in the first four  kermit davis  first rebel squad is an eight seed  thanks to   straight win  including recent one over auburn and mississippi state  a for temple  it avoided near disater on saturday against a much improved south florida squad  winning in ot  a loss to the bull would have undone much of the goodwill the owl earned in defeating houston on wednesday  <BRK> a for the orange  their overtime heroic not only earned them a reprieve from the nit  where i wa prepared to drop them following saturday s home loss to georgia tech  but a   seed  which keep jim boeheim s squad out of the first four   for now  a saturday visit from pitt    p m   acc rsns espn   await  and danger lurks for syracuse thanks to a bad habit of playing to it opposition s level  <BRK> a for the two team that departed  creighton s hope of a return are a bit higher than san francisco  thanks to the quality win available in the big eat  the don  meanwhile  must improve upon their     record in group   game  with saturday s home loss to gonzaga and december s defeat at the hand of buffalo in northern ireland already looking like real missed opportunity   plus there wa the don  scheduled november home game with arizona state that wa called off due to the california wildfire and not rescheduled   kyle smith s squad must now focus on consecutive early february road game at saint mary s  nearing the net s top    and gonzaga   contest that are undoubtedly circled in red somewhere in the don  locker room  <BRK> on friday  i ll be back with a look at how the race for the four no    seed look here in mid january  <BRK>
