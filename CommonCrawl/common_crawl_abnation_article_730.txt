the nfl draft is all about filling need  people always espouse the best player available philosophy  but after seven round most team have their need filled  <BRK>that will be no different for the   nfl draft  after exploring some potential trade option in last week s mock draft  this week is all about determining team need  with each pick in this week s mock draft  four need in loose order are mentioned  they ll obviously change when free agency start on march   <BRK>offseason need  offensive line  interior defensive line  wide receiver  tight end<BRK>the cardinal have plenty of work to do under new head coach kliff kingsbury  so much so  it s probably easier to point out what arizona doesn t need to fix this offseason  in an ideal situation  the cardinal could trade down and try to fix both line  but the value of the first pick is lesser this year since team might not jump to no    for a quarterback  because of that  holding there and taking bosa make the most sense  but after that  the cardinal need to fix one of the nfl s worst roster   starting with protecting franchise quarterback josh rosen <BRK>offseason need  safety  edge defender  wide receiver  cornerback<BRK>it s clear the  er need to fix the secondary this offseason  ahkello witherpoon is a solid cornerback  and richard sherman is still holding up  but after them  san francisco is thin at cornerback  and the team need a consistent safety presence  all of that is why the  er finished last in pro football focus  secondary ranking this season <BRK>unfortunately  there just isn t value with the second pick in the defensive backfield  there is up front on defense  though  despite taking arik armstead  deforest buckner  and solomon thomas in recent year  san francisco still need pas rush help  that s where allen come in  he can play on the strong side and rush the edge <BRK>offseason need  running back  offensive line  edge defender  cornerback<BRK>a lot of what the jet do will depend on how general manager mike maccagnan evaluates the draft s offensive tackle class  if he love a tackle  he could surprise people at no    with someone like jonah williams of alabama  but if he doesn t  he could go big upside with a pas rusher like gary  he s a superb athlete at   pound and should only get better with good coaching  defensive coordinator gregg williams will love moving gary all around the defensive line to create mismatch <BRK>offseason need  edge defender  cornerback  running back  wide receiver <BRK>defensive tackle might not be oakland s biggest need after drafting good player like maurice hurst and p j  hall in    still  the raider just need talent  almost regardless of position  williams provides it  his skill set will allow the raider to vary their front if they want  and it will give them a player some consider the draft s top prospect <BRK>offseason need  safety  edge defender  defensive tackle  offensive tackle<BRK>a lot of what the buccaneer do in the first round will depend on if offensive tackle donovan smith is brought back  if he s not  a left tackle might be the team s biggest need  finding a quality defensive tackle next to second year player vita vea ha to be high on the team s shopping list too  oliver can help an ordinary run defense and help spark the pas rush from up the middle  <BRK>offseason need  quarterback  offensive tackle  safety  linebacker<BRK>new york s entire offseaon is dependent on what it think of hakins  if he s evaluated a a franchise quarterback  he s the smart pick at no     if there is doubt  adding other piece around eli manning should take precedence  oklahoma right tackle cody ford is the player to keep in mind in that regard <BRK>offseason need  quarterback  offensive line  tight end  safety<BRK>many expect the jaguar to be the landing spot for philadelphia eagle backup quarterback nick foles  that s a move that will be hotly debated  but probably leaf jacksonville looking for a first round quarterback in   or    after quarterback  the jaguar really need to figure out their offensive line  right guard a j  cann is a free agent  and the entire left side suffered injury in    a player like williams could be used at tackle or guard <BRK>offseason need  edge defender  tight end  linebacker  guard<BRK>in burn  lion head coach matt patricia could see a player similar to chandler jones  whom he coached in his first four year in the nfl  an athletic and lanky pas rusher  burn would fill detroit s biggest hole this offseason  this could also be a spot for iowa tight end t j  hockenson  if he test well next week at the nfl scouting combine <BRK>offseason need  offensive line  defensive tackle  wide receiver  cornerback<BRK>josh allen faced a lot of pressure last season  and if that continues  pressure eventually become hit  those hit  at any moment  could become injury  to decrease that  the bill need to fix their offensive line  namely on the right side  ford is a natural at right tackle  and he can be left on an island to pick up defensive end  <BRK>offseason need  offensive line  cornerback  tight end  linebacker<BRK>in trading for quarterback joe flacco  the bronco are probably under the assumption they ve checked off their main priority this offseason  with a statue like flacco in the pocket  the bronco better figure out how to keep him upright  beyond left tackle  denver ha question along the offensive line  taylor would be a natural bookend  <BRK>offseason need  offensive tackle  linebacker  tight end  quarterback<BRK>if we re being honest  cincinnati s biggest need is a defensive coordinator considering the difficulty the team ha had hiring one  how is it so many people have turned down that job  <BRK>anyway  back to the mock draft  if we see back to back right tackle pick  the bengal are in a little bit of trouble  both player would be great need fit and have fair value at no     if ford and taylor are gone  though  cincinnati could go defense with white  <BRK>offseason need  edge defender  tight end  guard  defensive line<BRK>green bay s need this offseason should easily be addressed due to having two first round pick this year  after an edge defender  tight end  and guard  the rest of the packer  concern are more about depth and looking beyond the   season  that s why some mock have had green bay doubling up on pas rusher  clay matthew is likely gone  and nick perry isn t living up to his massive contract  <BRK>offseason need  quarterback  offensive tackle  edge defender  defensive tackle<BRK>here s a ripple effect of the bronco  pending acquisition of flacco  if we re being honest  lock doesn t grade out a a top   player  although this is just a few spot after the first    it s le of a reach for him at no     lock s play will remind dolphin fan of jay cutler  for good and bad reaons <BRK>offseason need  defensive tackle  offensive tackle  cornerback  guard<BRK>here s another place where one of those right tackle could be in play  if the falcon decide this is the offseason to upgrade over ryan schraeder  ford and taylor will be hard to ignore  if they re gone  the falcon could consider a defensive tackle  arguably the franchise s top need  wilkins and grady jarrett  assuming he get the franchise tag or is re signed  would give the falcon a scary duo up the middle  <BRK>offseason need  quarterback  wide receiver  safety  guard<BRK>if alex smith miss out on the   season  quarterback becomes washington s top need this offseason  the next two month of the draft process regarding murray will be fascinating  the take are already coming  some think murray is too small for an nfl quarterback  at a listed      some think his size isn t an issue  <BRK>offseason need  edge defender  offensive tackle  safety  guard<BRK>even before julius pepper announced the end to his legendary career  the panther needed to find a pas rusher this offseason  that s now doubly true  mario addison is carolina s only viable defensive end currently  ferrell could end up being a top   pick  so to get him at no    would be a steal  he s not a star athlete for an end  but he win with technique and power <BRK>offseason need  defensive tackle  offensive tackle  linebacker  cornerback<BRK>cornerback might not seem like a question mark for the brown after taking denzel ward at no    lat year and adding some veteran like terrance mitchell and t j  carrie  but consider that ward is coming off two concussion at the end of lat seaon  mitchell had a broken arm  and carrie wa just average  the team will also have to make a decision on slot corner briean boddy calhoun  all that add up to cornerback potentially being an early need  especially if a player a good a williams slip in the first round <BRK>offseason need  offensive tackle  guard  defensive tackle  running back<BRK>minnesota s problem on the offensive line are well known  left tackle riley reiff might move inside to guard  where tom compton is a free agent and mike remmers ha underwhelmed  and ha a contract that make him easily expendable   if reiff is shifted inside  left tackle obviously becomes minnesota s obvious need  dillard is a smooth edge blocker who should have a nice week at the combine <BRK>offseason need  wide receiver  edge defender  guard  quarterback<BRK>finding help for marcus mariota ha to be the top priority for the titan if they think he s still the quarterback of the future in tennessee  if they think otherwise  quarterback rise up the need ranking  brown can take the top off defense with his speed and pick apart zone underneath  the titan simply don t have a wide receiver who can do what he doe <BRK>offseason need  linebacker  cornerback  tight end  safety  offensive tackle<BRK>for such a good team  the steelers have a lot of important need this offseason  chief among them might be cornerback  joe haden only ha one year left on his contract and artie burn han t lived up to his first round draft placement  murphy ha instinct and playmaking skill that pittsburgh desperately need <BRK>offseason need  defensive line  guard  linebacker  kicker<BRK>this pick might be a little dull  but it s possible if seattle hold at no     which is probably not likely   guard d j  fluker and j r  sweezy are free agent  and if they depart the seahawks will need to restock the line with top talent  risner can play a number of position  but his best spot in the nfl might be at guard <BRK>offseason need  edge rusher  wide receiver  linebacker  running back<BRK>za darius smith and terrell suggs are both free agent  so it might be time for the raven go after a pas rusher in the first round  sweat is one of the premier sack artist in the draft this year  and he us his size and speed to beat blocker around the corner  <BRK>offseason need  offensive tackle  cornerback  defensive line  tight end<BRK>little might be somewhat raw coming out of college  but left tackle with his athleticism and skill don t drop far in the draft  the question will be about taking the fourth offensive tackle in the first round  or the third cornerback  both are big need for houston  so this pick will ultimately come down to player grade <BRK>offseason need  edge defender  cornerback  running back  wide receiver <BRK>metcalf is masive now  like  scary masive  maybe too masive for a wide receiver  actually   be that a it may  metcalf ha star potential at wide receiver  that just so happens to be one of oakland s top need  if the raider can find a jersey big enough for him <BRK>offseason need  cornerback  offensive tackle  running back  defensive line<BRK>the eagle obviously need to find some fix in the secondary  and left tackle jason peter  career is winding down  but it will be hard to pas up on jacob  easily the draft s top running back this year  jay ajayi is a free agent the eagle could let walk  and philadelphia s backup are nothing special  jacob can be special <BRK>offseason need  defensive end  cornerback  wide receiver  defensive tackle<BRK>considering indianapolis  need this offseaon  none stand out a more important than the other  the secondary could need retooling due to free agency status of cornerback pierre desir and safety clayton geathers  the colt need player more suited for a     defense up front and a slot wide receiver who could open the offense  jones may be attractive a a player who fit on the inside and provides some pas rush <BRK>offseason need  edge defender  cornerback  running back  wide receiver <BRK>if the raider don t get a pas rusher in free agency  they absolutely need to in the draft  it s difficult in the final third of the first round  so it might behoove the raider to trade up with their two pick in the  s  if that doen t happen  a player like allen could be in play  he s a power rushing end and doe a nice job setting the edge against the run <BRK>offseason need  offensive tackle  defensive tackle  linebacker  quarterback<BRK>right tackle turned out to be a big problem for the charger with sam tevi starting  whether it s in free agency or the draft  los angeles should seek an upgrade this offseason  that player could be cajuste  who would have to move to the right side after starting at left tackle last season for the mountaineer  if los angle doesn t re sign darius philon  defensive line becomes a must <BRK>offseason need  cornerback  safety  defensive tackle  center<BRK>kansa city s pas coverage  especially on deep throw  wa abysmal last season  that s why baker remains a regular pick for the chief  he s not the fastest cornerback  but he know how to stick with receiver  keep an eye on alabama safety deionte thompson  too  he could be an eric berry replacement  <BRK>offseason need  edge defender  tight end  guard  defensive line<BRK>a good a of a prospect a hockenson is  it s hard to find good landing spot for tight end in the first round  especially after you get pat the first   or so pick  that s obviously a good thing for the packer  who get one of the   best player in the draft near the end of the first round <BRK>offseason need  safety  edge defender  guard  offensive tackle<BRK>this is obviously a huge  enormous risk the ram would take by selecting simmons  it s possible simmons doesn t play at all in   after tearing his acl while training  it doesn t even fill what i perceive a one of their top need  but his talent and potential is that of a top   player in this draft  the ram have to fill plenty of need  but simmons could be special when he s healthy <BRK>offseason need  edge defender  tight end  defensive tackle  wide receiver<BRK>a mentioned above  it s hard to get a pas rusher in the back of the first round  because of that  the patriot could look for one later in the draft  that move tight end to arguably the team s top need  fant may not be a top blocker  but new england should be able to utilize his skill a a pas catcher <BRK><BRK>
