the nfl s highest paid star are quarterback  so it make sense that the second most valuable player are the guy who terrorize quarterback  the smash mouth defender capable of pushing an offense backwards  but before guy could make big buck for manhandling quarterback  the nfl had to define and measure that valuable skill  it took longer than you d think  <BRK> american football began a a college sport in the late  th century  with a variety of rule set  some focused on kicking a ball through a goal like soccer  others were built around carrying the ball like rugby  but what baically all version of football had in common wa chaos  large  violent mob of men pushing and grappling to try to advance the ball downfield  you know  just guy being dude  <BRK> but around    a dapper gentleman named walter camp proposed rule change that would shape the game you now recognize a football  camp s version of the game organized the mob  smaller one than before  on either side of an ever changing line of scrimmage  a temporary barrier that neither team could cross until the play began  the play started when a player snapped the ball  first by kicking  but eventually with the hand  to a player designated a the quarterback  <BRK> by    when the league that would eventually become the nfl formed  the game wan t all that different from the one we re still watching a century later  and the game still hinged on the line  a soon a that line of scrimmage wa drawn  defense were concocting way to bust through it and bury the guy with the ball  they called this  dumping  the quarterback  made sense  you ran right up to the guy with the ball and dumped him on his as  <BRK> dumping the qb wa a distinct and important event in any game  but league didn t bother to track it  a team or a player might keep count a a matter of pride  but you wouldn t find it on any stat sheet  by the   s  the nfl recorded instance of quarterback losing yardage  but not the player who made that happen  before that would happen  the dump would need some pr  but first a name change  <BRK> there are a few potential origin for the term  sack   it is  after all  a pretty obvious metaphor  just like the visigoth sacking rome  linebacker topple the quarterback  but that s not what wahington coach george allen meant when he used the term in the early   s  according to assistant coach marv levy  allen wa game planning for dallas cowboy quarterback craig morton  and vowed to  take that morton salt and pour him into a sack   classic   s smack  <BRK> morton later sued the nfl for failing to protect player from head injury  the case made the league see the error in their way  and now they do a great job with player safety  <BRK> anyway  the man who most famously drew the parallel between tackling a quarterback for a loss and pillaging a city wa deacon jones  a man who terrorized qbs and really anyone who stood in his way  jones haunted quarterback in the   s and   s  and claimed to have developed the term  sacking   said deacon   sacking a quarterback is just like you devastate a city or you cream a multitude of people  i mean it s just like you put all the offensive player in one bag and i just take a baseball bat and beat on the bag   <BRK> america picked up on the word  and you can find reference to  sacking  the quarterback popping up in newspaper around the late   s  before george allen supposedly coined the term for use in his salt related smack talk  but the nfl still wasn t recording the statistic  sack artist like jones and his similarly destructive ram teammate coy bacon had to keep track themselves  <BRK> the ram   fearsome foursome  wa one in a long line of nicknamed defense that popped up in the   s and early   s  defense wa becoming marketable  with the sack a it signature move  and sack were becoming bankable  too  a new crop of defensive star like lawrence taylor were getting contract incentive baed on the number of sack they recorded  <BRK> so finally  before the    season  the nfl decided to begin logging sack  the first  sack  registered by individual player happened on september       you d need play by play data to say which one wa first  but i can tell you lt had one that day  jack youngblood had one  houston s jesse baker and cleveland s chip bank each had    <BRK> the real pioneer of the sack came long before  the player who took up  dumping  the quarterback a soon a the line of scrimmage wa invented and the defensive star whose individual effort went undocumented  <BRK> but technically  officially speaking  the guy who sacked quarterback on september      were the first to do it  so there you go  <BRK>  <BRK>
