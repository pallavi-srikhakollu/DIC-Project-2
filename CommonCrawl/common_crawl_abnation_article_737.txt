zion williamson is about to be rich beyond his wildest dream <BRK>the duke star ha spent his freshman seaon owning espn  rewriting the college baketball record book  and putting a lock on his status a the no    pick in the nba draft come june  williamson s first nba contract will make him wealthy   about    million over four year   but that pale in comparison to his potential earnings off the court  <BRK>williamson will be the subject of a massive bidding war for his shoe deal  which some are estimating could be worth    million  he ll be flooded with other endorsement opportunity from the moment he becomes a pro  there s going to be an entire industry built around his brand <BRK>williamson doen t get to pick his first nba team  but he doe get to pick his agent  if you ve been paying attention to duke game lately  you ve seen some famous face in the crowd that may or may not be trying to get his attention <BRK>everyone want a piece of the most famous   year old athlete in america  these are the potential agent who are already making a public push to be seen by williamson <BRK>klutch sport is the infamous lebron james affiliated agency run by his close friend  rich paul  this is the agency behind the anthony davis trade demand that put the nba on it head last month  it doesn t take a detective to figure out they re making a play to sign williamson <BRK>with the lakers on an east coast road trip right before the all star break  james and teammate rajon rondo made an appearance at duke s game against virginia in charlottesville  uncoincidentally  paul wa there  too  <BRK>rich paul made the call on that zion breakaway dunk  welcome to klutch sport  zionw  pic twitter com ojzksxih <BRK>james quickly got defensive when asked about his trip to see williamson  <BRK> a recruiting trip  i didn t talk to anybody   james told espn <BRK> they re only saying that because it s rich  when shaq came to see me play in high school  when a i  came to see me play in high school  they weren t saying it wa a recruiting trip then  but because it s rich paul and james  now it s a recruitment trip <BRK> now rich is a threat to everybody  and they look at it and they want to keep trying to jab my agent and jab my friend  and what is he doing that s wrong  they don t say that about no other agent when other guy go see  player   they don t say that about no other agent  but my guy because he s a threat <BRK> and he s african american  too  throw that in there  <BRK>james ha other tie to duke  of course  winning two olympic gold medal playing for head coach mike krzyzewski and also a the father of a son who ha a standing scholarship offer from the blue devil  still  it wa hard to see james and paul up close at a duke game and not think of it a a way to get williamson to notice them <BRK>james wa far more effusive when asked about williamson at all star weekend in charlotte  he said the comparison between williamson and himself were a good thing for the game and continued to heap praise upon the duke freshman  <BRK>lakers  lebron james with high praise for duke s zion williamson   i think the comparison thing will never stop  it s good for the game    i like everything about the kid    he s humble    he keep the main thing  the main thing  and that s basketball   pic twitter com iicblqv r<BRK>again  none of this is to say james is recruiting williamson  james isn t even technically affiliated with klutch sport  other than a the agency s marquee client  but people are taking notice and drawing their own conclusion  <BRK>here s what virginia star kyle guy said after noticing james and paul in the crowd at his game against duke <BRK>kyle guy  good quote  on lebron catching uva on saturday but really showing up for duke   i m sure most of those guy are going to sign with klutch sport  agency anyways  <BRK>don t forget that duke teammate cameron reddish wa spotted at a coffee shop with james and paul two summer ago a he wa entering his senior year of high school  maybe guy is on to something <BRK>klutch ha been on a tear lately  it signed davis at the start of this nba seaon to add to a roster that already includes ben simmons  john wall  and eric bledsoe  klutch is already cornering the market ahead of the   draft  signing projected top   pick darius garland  who declared early after a seaon ending injury at vanderbilt  a well a darius bazley  the former syracuse commit who opted to spend this seaon training for the draft instead  <BRK>two week before james showed up to watch wiliamson  another famous face wa courtside to see him against pitt  that would be none other than jay z  <BRK>jay z sitting sitting court side at pitt v duke regular season game right now  hov about to throw in a record deal when zion sign to  rocnationsports pic twitter com  vi vnyhxo<BRK>jay z founded roc nation sport in    an agency that ha represents client in the nba  nfl  mlb  european soccer  and boxing  roc nation s roster includes kevin durant and jeremy lin  running back saquon barkley and todd gurley  and mets second baseman robinson can√≥ <BRK>did williamson notice jay z sitting courtside  of course he did <BRK> that wa like a dream come true   williamson said  per espn   to me  he s the goat  <BRK> when he walk in  with his squad  you look over and you re like   oh  my god  that s him    williamson said <BRK>pitt head coach jeff capel  a former duke assistant  set up the appearance <BRK> his people reached out to me a few week ago  actually  about him wanting to come   about them wanting to come  people from roc nation   said pitt coach jeff capel  a former duke assistant  per triblive   our athletic department and our ticketing people did an amazing job accommodating that  <BRK>williamson is apparently a big fan of jay z s music  this is back from williamson s high school day when he used to write a diary for usa today <BRK>ok  on the music side  y all already know what it is with drake and how often i listen him  but lately i ve been going back and listening to more jay z <BRK>i went back and listened to the black album and the blueprint and just got reminded of how cold he is <BRK>ok guy that concludes another blog for me  i want to thank everyone who took the time to read and i ve gotta say again that y all should go back and listen to jay z s the black album because that man is too cold <BRK>another one <BRK>ok on the music side  you already know i m still listening to drake  j  cole  jay z and migos <BRK>but i ve really been listening to jay z a lot more than normal <BRK>he just spit that truth  i can t say it s just one album either  i m all over the place with what i m listening to from him <BRK>on president day  williamson posted a jay z song to his instagram story <BRK>if you really want to feel old  williamson wa only three year old when the black album wa released  <BRK>while lonzo ball say  no one listens to na   williamson respect his elder in the rap game  we ll see if that mean anything when it s time for him to sign an agent <BRK>tmz stuck a microphone in floyd mayweather s face lat week and he told them that he hope to sign williamson a the first nba client of mayweather promotion  he did this in typical fahion <BRK>mayweather already run mayweather promotion    and rep a bunch of young boxing star  but  mayweather tell u he s been working with nba agent alonzo earle and he ha seriou interest in signing basketball player  <BRK>so  what s the pitch  mayweather say he can teach young superstar like williamson to not only make a ton of money during their career  but he ll make sure they re financially set in retirement too  <BRK> if zion sign with me  you got my word that he gonna have a comfortable life when he s on the court and off the court     if he did  <BRK>to prove his point  mayweather busted open a backpack filled with about      in cash  <BRK>a few day later  mayweather showed up courtside at a duke game <BRK>one of the best athlete in the history of his sport also pictured floyd mayweather  pic twitter com ieyoyqdzdf<BRK>williamson took notice and his teammate took picture with mayweather <BRK> i think that s just the duke affect  sic    williamson said   you ve got to understand  coach k is the greatest coach of all time  i mean  a lot of people want to just come and experience cameron  so  i mean  we appreciate floyd and all  <BRK>this shouldn t be taken seriously  mayweather promotion to this point only represents boxer  and it founder is an objectively vile human being  but this is just another example of how everyone want a piece of williamson  <BRK>every heavy hitter in the agency world will make a push for williamson  bill duffy of bda is expected to be a contender  the wasserman group and caa have signed superstar all over sport  <BRK>there han t been a young athlete with a much star power a williamson in a long  long time  this race is just getting started <BRK>
