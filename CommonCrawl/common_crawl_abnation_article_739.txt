quarterback play is more important than ever in the nfl  the   playoff are proof <BRK>the lat four team standing in this year s postseaon are each helmed by top tier paser  the saint and patriot are anchored by    year old stalwart whose hall of fame vote will be mere formality  former no    overall pick jared goff built himself into an mvp candidate while making the ram a contender  he ll almost certainly lose that award to patrick mahomes  who needed just one seaon a a starter to cement himself a one of the league s most dynamic player <BRK>that s left u with a pair of conference championhip game destined to keep scoreboard operator buy throughout sunday  but which team can boat the best quarterback in the nfl s final four  will experience conquer youth  or will the league s upstart uher in a new era of champion  will tom brady s seaon end  a it ha five time before  by raising the lombardi trophy  or will goff give los angeles something to be excited about by leading the ram to their first super bowl title on the west coat <BRK>we won t know until sunday night  but we can certainly rank   s remaining playoff passer based on their season to date <BRK>goff ha fulfilled expectation after being selected with the first overall pick in the   nfl draft  changing the way team across the league rebuild in the process  the former cal quarterback ha teamed up with emerging young head coach sean mcvay to electrify the league with a spread passing game that perfectly complement the gashing running attack of todd gurley <BRK>over the pat two seaon  goff ha been a top six paser in term of pasing yard  fifth   pasing touchdown  tied for fourth   paser rating  sixth   and most importantly  win  tied for first   he emerged a an mvp candidate in his third seaon a a pro  but fell back to earth a a late seaon slump crushed la s hope of claiming home field advantage in the nfc  while he responded with three straight win  two of those came over the hopeless cardinal and  er  and lat week s win over the cowboy happened around him without too much interference  goff completed just   of his   pases for   yard and no touchdown in a game where gurley and c j  anderon did all the heaviest lifting <BRK>on sunday  he ll face a saint defense that had an up and down season but still managed to snuff out most big passing play before they could happen in    that proficiency didn t limit him the first time these team met  goff threw for   yard on   completion  including three touchdown  that bested the     yard per catch average he s posted in each of the past two year   a number that wa good enough to lead the league in   and rank third in    the ram lost that game to the saint  however  leaving goff with plenty to prove  <BRK>even so  if the nfc title game explodes in firework  goff is the kind of technician you want to get the most bang for your buck <BRK>brady slowed down from his furious     pace and regressed back to his career average in    it turn out that s still pretty good  <BRK>the   year old ha been uneven this season  falling from the top five statistical height of his unprecedented old man mvp run last fall and into the second tier of quarterback  the patriot claimed their  th straight afc east title regardless  and now new england stand on the precipice of it fourth super bowl appearance in five year  <BRK>that s because brady saved his best work for his toughest opponent  his patriot are     against playoff team this season  but     against franchise whose super bowl hope were dashed after week   <BRK>brady s blueprint to success sunday involves a game plan where he throw roughly   pass  get the protection that keep him upright throughout the evening  and allows him to do the tom brady thing that have delivered the poor unfortunate soul of new england five super bowl parade this millennium  in kansa city  he ll play the role that rocketed him to stardom way back in    the underdog  it s a position in which the patriot are reveling <BRK>oh  nfltotalaccess    everythingwegot pic twitter com phrljfsoz <BRK>no passer left standing ha a stronger overall playoff resume than brady  bet against him at your own risk  but he s looked more human than ever in stretch this season  sliding a pair of mvp candidate ahead of him in   s final four ranking  <BRK>yep  this is a stacked list <BRK>brees and mahomes were neck and neck in this year s mvp race before a late season slump likely cost the veteran his shot at finally earning the league s top regular season award  concern over that finish   even with   passing yard over his past two start   were just enough to negate brees  wealth of veteran experience and   playoff spot and give the budding young quarterback in western missouri the edge <BRK>the saint overcame a three game stretch in which brees averaged only   passing yard per game  and threw only two touchdown pass but three interception  to claim the top record in the nfl  the two week off created by a meaningless week   game and a wild card bye appears to have recharged the   year old  he rose up for   passing yard while dispelling the myth of nick foles in a     divisional round win against the eagle <BRK>but while he turned in an extremely drew brees stat line in victory  a     percent completion rate  two touchdown   there wa still cause for concern  his lone interception came when he missed an open ted ginn jr  deep on his first pas of the evening  it wa a mistake he d make again in the second half <BRK>drew brees ha now underthrown   different sure thing deep ball touchdown v  the eagle pic twitter com db zlizqf<BRK>those two missed opportunity took   point off the board for new orleans  while it didn t come back to bite the saint last week  it could be a major issue in a looming shootout against the ram and the high scoring chief or patriot team brees ha to face in a potential super bowl <BRK>but brees is     in the postseason with the saint  which includes a     record in the superdome  he s also got a sterling     passer rating in playoff game   nearly   point higher than brady s postseason mark  while it s fair to wonder whether those superpower are waning now that he s hit his fifth decade of existence  it s also fair to look at that resume and feel pretty good about new orleans  chance sunday <BRK>mahomes didn t have a touchdown pas in his divisional round win over the colt  the fact he didn t need one in a win that wa never in question make the chief terrifying <BRK>mahomes failed to find the end zone for just the second time this seaon  but that didn t matter a kansa city rolled over indianapolis and earned the right to host the first afc championship game in franchise history  the second year paser wa still solid in victory  taking too many sack   his four were the second most he s suffered in a single game   but managing to throw for   yard and running for a score to erae indianapolis  fairy tale ending <BRK>the cold never bothered him anyway     pic twitter com zefsnwbqem<BRK>those number don t showcase his greatest strength  mahomes ha been a revelation thanks to his ability to extend play in the pocket and draw defense away from their assignment  he then us that extra second or two he s bought behind the line of scrimmage to find a long list of receiving talent  here  he bewilders the colt  defensive line just long enough to free all pro travis kelce for a tidy gain <BRK> somethingsmart i said it during the game but out of structure  mahomes is playing chess while others are playing checker  he want kelce but hold the ball and widens to get linebacker anthony walker to commit before getting rid of the ball  pic twitter com  vweucch r<BRK>kansa city will expect even more from him in his second postseason start  and mahomes  stellar regular season suggests he ll get them  the former texas tech star is an overwhelming favorite to win the   regular season mvp award after throwing for nearly     yard and slinging   touchdown pass for the league s top ranked offense  he may be the least experienced quarterback playing sunday     but he s also the only guy who can do this <BRK>go ahead and put mahomes in the hall of fame right now  pic twitter com  jwqatkft <BRK>mahomes is facing the biggest game of his career to date when the patriot come to town  he ll have   time le experience than the quarterback he ll duel against with a trip to the super bowl on the line  but winning his team s first home playoff game in   year wasn t too big for mahomes   and there s a good chance his showdown against a top   passing defense in the afc championship game won t be  either  <BRK>
