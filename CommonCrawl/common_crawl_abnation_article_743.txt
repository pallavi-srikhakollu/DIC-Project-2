anthony edward didn t know how to handle the request  it wa the first time he looked unsure of himself all weekend  he had spent four day playing the best basketball of his life just a short drive from where he grew up in atlanta  racking up point at the under armour challenge with such ruthless efficiency that recruiting insider began wondering aloud if he could be the no    player in the country   <BRK> they weren t the only one who took notice  a edward tried to exit the masive gym in emerson  georgia  a young fan aked for his autograph  edward wa bewildered  no one had ever aked that of him before  his long time trainer justin holland could only laugh when edward went to him for advice  <BRK>  the next day  we took a pad and practiced some different autograph   holland say   i said   get used to it    <BRK> this is edward  life now  forced to grow up at   because his talent demanded it   <BRK> a year ago  he wa entering his sophomore seaon at a new school  focusing on baketball full time for the first time  and fighting for national respect a a four star recruit  now  he s a senior needing to make a college decision and suddenly drawing hype a the potential no    overall pick in the   nba draft  <BRK> edward decided to  reclasify  in late november  allowing him to skip his junior seaon to put him another year closer to college and the pro  he announced his intention an hour before james wiseman  then the no    senior in the country  made his college choice  before wiseman could even say he would be attending memphis over kentucky  edward had already leapfrogged him in the eye of some scouting service  in may    sport had edward a the no    player in the   clas  now you won t find a scouting service that rank him outside of the top four for    <BRK> edward  game feel perfectly suited for the modern era of the sport  at      he s an attacking combo guard with an unbreakable resolve to give you bucket from all three level  edward can cross you over  he can hit you with a step back three  or he can dunk on your head  he play relentlessly   <BRK>  i had a killer mentality coming into this summer because i knew what my plan were a far a graduating   edward tell sb nation   i just had the mentality that i have to kill if i want to be a mcdonald s all american    <BRK> edward ha always been planning for this moment  but it came more quickly than even he could have anticipated  coalescing this summer when edward wa named mvp of the under armour association playing for atlanta xpress  the transcendent athletic ability he showed from an early age didn t always manifest on the basketball court  now that he s harnessed that athleticism  even faster than anyone could have hoped  there s no telling where he can go from here  <BRK> he wa known a  ant man  around atlanta before he even hit puberty  edward  father gave him the nickname when edward wa   year old   far pre dating the paul rudd superhero movie  but still fitting for his own spectacular origin story   <BRK> in those day   ant man  wan t a can t miss prospect on the hardwood just yet  instead  he wa the most dominant kid on the football field  <BRK> youtube is full of video of a young edward tearing up defense  he primarily played tailback  but he also logged time at quarterback and cornerback  no matter where edward lined up  he wa unstoppable  in the football crazy south  edward looked like the next big thing on the gridiron  <BRK>  i could have been a professional football player   edward say   i wa really good  i wa the no    running back in the country at   or    i stopped playing because i seen my brother playing basketball  i thought it looked more fun   <BRK> edward remembers where he fell in love with basketball  <BRK>  in the backyard of my grandma s house   he say   in the summer time  my brother and i  had nothing else to do unless we were going to summer camp  we just used to go there and play  i never used to win so i just got fed up with it  i m like  one day  i m gonna beat them   <BRK> edward finally got the better of his brother in ninth grade  that s the same the year he also started his regular training session with holland  <BRK> holland knew who edward wa before he ever met him because of his reputation on the football field  he also knew edward had a long way to go a a baketball player  <BRK>  i remember in one of the early session he told me   coach  if i learn how to shoot  i m going to be the best player in the country    holland remembers    i m gonna be unguardable   he literally said that to me in his ninth grade year   <BRK> holland never had edward  talent during his own playing day  but he wa familiar with the spotlight  he wa part of the first atlanta high school basketball game to be broadcast on espn when he started at point guard for landmark christian high school in    alongside future kentucky star randolph morris  against dwight howard s southwest atlanta christian academy   <BRK> holland would go on to play at liberty  but that s where his career stalled out  shortly after  he started personally training some of the best high school player around atlanta  <BRK> holland s training session included four of the area s top player when he started working with edward  headlined by current florida state sophomore guard m j  walker  holland remembers thinking edward wa a little lazy at first  but the young guard quickly learned how to adapt to the level of competition  <BRK>  the first thing about it is he wa already a freak athletically   holland say   god made him that   <BRK> holland saw he needed to build edward  jump shot from scratch  so they started at the most fundamental level  holland prioritized maintaining proper form and getting the right rotation on the ball  they started slowly by trying to get edward to make   or   shot right in front of the rim with the mechanic holland required  that first year  holland didn t even let edward shoot a three in their session   <BRK>  if you can t get the right rotation on the ball close to the rim  i m not going to bring you out   holland say  <BRK> edward  shot wa hardly an overnight success story  but he slowly progressed and began to stack up to holland s other protégés  when walker wa named a mcdonald s all american  it only made edward hungrier  and a his jumper improved  so did his confidence   <BRK> the summer going into his sophomore year  edward put himself on the map while playing on the under armour circuit  his bread and butter wa still driving to the basket   he wa just that much stronger and faster than his opponent  and also a little bit older before the reclassification   but for the first time  holland and others started to see edward evolve from an athlete into a basketball player  <BRK>  when  edward  made a jump shot  he would look at me like   that s those gym hour  i can shoot a little bit now    holland say   and i would look at him like   you ain t there yet  man  you re shooting better but you ain t there yet    <BRK> ty anderson ha coaching in his blood  he is the grandson of lefty driesell  the fourth winningest coach in college basketball history  and the man who brought maryland basketball to relevance from   to    <BRK> anderson wa a walk on at georgia tech under paul hewitt and started coaching at the high school level around atlanta soon after  last summer he took the head job at edward  high school  holy spirit prep  knowing exactly what he wa inheriting after edward led the team to a state title the previous season  anderson told his grandpa he had the best player in the country   <BRK> driesell wa hesitant to believe it until a conversation he had at his enshrinement into the basketball hall of fame in september  that s when driesell brought up edward to another famous college coach who is currently recruiting him  the coach s response  that edward would be the first pick in the nba draft if he could enter right now  <BRK> anderson s time with edward might be limited now that he s a senior  but his new coach is making the most of it  he s leaned on his famous grandpa for some help  <BRK> when anderson sent driesell some footage of edward  the   year old immediately drew a connection to the best player he ever coached  len bias  driesell told his grandson he used to run a play for bias that would be perfect for anderson  it s essentially a  floppy  set that allows his star to come off a double screen on one side  or a single screen on the other  sure enough  anderson ha made it one of holy spirit s go to set  <BRK>  it s pretty cool that   something year ago granddad wa running it for the best player in the country   anderson say   now i am   <BRK> for anderson  this season is a chance to coach the best player he might ever be around  for edward  it s about trying to win another state championship and continuing his push to become the consensus no    player in the country by the time he enters college   <BRK> all edward did this summer wa ace every test he faced  he wa arguably the best player at the nbpa top   camp and the pangos all american camp  he took home co mvp honor at steph curry s sc  camp  and he dominated the under armour circuit every time he took the court   <BRK> edward  number in the under armour association speak for themselves  he averaged     point      rebound      assist  and     block per game  he also nailed down his shot  going     percent from the field  and     percent from three point range on     attempt per game  he closed the season with nine straight game scoring at least   point  when it wa over  he wa named league mvp   <BRK> edward accomplished all of this a a nominal incoming junior  but he always had plan to move into the senior clas in the back of his head  reclasification is common for elite high school player  with karl anthony town  andrew wiggins  marvin bagley iii  and r j  barrett being recent prominent example  all of those player have been or will be top nba draft pick  a trajectory edward is expected to follow   <BRK>  basketball wise  anthony edward doesn t need another year of high school basketball   anderson say   you see that when you watch him  he s ready to take the leap  what he s been able to do academically is make that a possibility for himself   <BRK> edward ha been enrolled in online class approved by the ncaa since the summer  he s done all of this while leading anderson s holy spirit prep team and maintaining his training regimen with holland   <BRK> ant man is officially a star  the only question left is just how brightly he ll shine  <BRK> edward ha trimmed his college list down to five school  florida state  kansa  north carolina  kentucky  and georgia  he say he s looking for a school that isn t too far from home  and one where he ha a close relationship with the coach  it s worth noting that leonard hamilton s florida state wa the first big program to make a serious push for him  edward remembers that  and it s why many recruiting insider view fsu a the favorite  <BRK> whoever land edward for his one year of college ball is getting a go to scorer with explosive athleticism  deep shooting range  and a mindset that s wired to never take a play off   <BRK>  anthony edward ain t no chilling around  make a play every here and there guy   say jerry meyer  lead scout for   sport   his nose is fully in there  his athleticism is functional  it translates  he s a beast   <BRK> life is accelerating to a frantic pace for edward  to a point that would be overwhelming for most young people in his position  but edward belief that he s uniquely equipped to handle everything thrown his way because of an upbringing that never gave him shortcut  he s talked openly about wanting to provide for his family  which ha grown recently after the birth of his niece  in a video interview with draftexpress  he mentioned feeling indebted to the people who raised him  including his mother who recently passed   i work     so that they can stop working       he said  <BRK>  i feel like i grew up at a really young age   edward say   i feel like nobody went through what i went through so me feeling like i m grown up now  i feel like i already went through stuff that make me feel like i ve grown up  that s just another stepping stone in life   <BRK> you get the sense edward ha been ready for this in his own mind for his entire life  born an athletic prodigy and nicknamed after a superhero  maybe his ascension wa only a matter of time  after year in the making  ant man s moment is finally here  <BRK>
