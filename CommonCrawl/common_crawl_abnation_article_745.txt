ever since the premier league wa created a an entirely separate financial entity from the english football pyramid in the late   s  and especially once it started play in the     seaon  there have been whisper around europe about creating a european  super league   this theoretical league  at one point in the late   s  it wa going to be called the europa league  until uefa rebranded the cup winner  cup  would do for the european bigshots across the continent what the premier league did for the english bigshots  <BRK>a super league would effectively wall off the garden full of money and keep it flowing exclusively to the big club  leaving the smaller club to more or le fend for themselves  over the year  the idea of a super league ha come and gone  and every time it s come up  it ha  for one reaon or another  been discarded  and domestic league have carried on more or le a they always have <BRK>guess what  the concept of a super league is back  and this time  it s back in a form that a lot of people might be interested in  uefa and the european club asociation  the body representing the interest of european club team  have apparently been talking about a major revamp of the champion league that would  at first reading  more or le destroy domestic league a we know them today  <BRK>hyperbole  not really  by  destroy   i don t mean  cease to exist   there would always be a domestic league  but check out the proposed change to the champion league  and tell me how a domestic league would look if this came into being  emphasis mine  <BRK>i admit i come at this from a position of bias   i am probably the last person on earth who like domestic league more than cup competition  so i m kind of opposed to this from the jump  just on general principle  but even a more objective observer than i can see  if these change are enacted  that domestic league would really be a shell of their former self after this <BRK>using england a an example  if you cleave off the big six  you re left with  just to oversimplify  the   current pl team and  to continue to oversimplify  let s call it the top six championship team  the premier league would still have promotion and relegation  so there d always be a decent mix of good premier league team and bad one  good championship team coming up and super bad pl team going down  on the surface  everything would be the same  at leat mechanically <BRK>with a larger  weekend champion league  though  there are three immediate problem i can see <BRK>for all this  i am not anti change  i am not anti modernity  i am  however  very sad that if these change come into existence  the game that i know and love will change irrevocably  and i m not at all convinced that said change will be for the better a far a the game go  domestic league are a ton of fun  and are the backbone of the game in europe  moving that backbone to an effectively closed champion super league won t be the end of the world  but it will  at leat for me  markedly decreae interest in that world <BRK>
