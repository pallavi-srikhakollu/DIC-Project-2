friday may have only given u five game that were decided by fewer than five point  but it also gave u five double digit seed advancing to the second round  so  you know  count your blessing  not your problem  <BRK>here s everything you need to know from the   game that made up day two of the   ncaa tournament  <BRK>       ohio state        iowa state    midwest <BRK>another day without an obvious classic lead to this pretty good  but not overly spectacular  late night   v    tilt occupying the top spot <BRK>ohio state led by two at the break and controlled most of the second half before a spirited iowa state rally gave the cyclone an opportunity to send the game to overtime  nick weiler babb s open three pointer in the closing second found nothing but iron  and the buckeye moved on to the second round for the second time in a many year under chris holtmann  <BRK>this marked the third time in the last five year that iowa state ha entered the ncaa tournament fresh off the momentum of a big   tournament title  in those three year  the cyclone have now won a grand total of one game in the big dance  the amount of bracket filler outers they ve pissed off over that span is that number time about a billion  <BRK>       liberty        mississippi state    east <BRK>caleb homesley dropped   point and hit a go ahead three     to play to carry liberty to it first ncaa tournament win in program history  the atlantic sun champion had been to the tournament three time before  losing twice a a   seed in the first round  and once a a   seed in the first four  <BRK>after leading by two at halftime  mississippi state appeared to take control of the game midway through the second half  the bulldog built a     lead  but then homesley took command of the contest  he scored   point in le than five minute  turning that   point deficit into a   point lead before anyone could get a handle on what had happened <BRK>caleb homesley cant miss pic twitter com czeviia qp<BRK>the  th best free throw shooting team in the country entering friday  liberty calmly sank eight free throw in the final minute to salt away the biggest win in program history <BRK>       uc irvine        kansa state    south <BRK>tennessee belmont and iowa cincinnati both have decent claim to the final spot here  but we ve gotta go with  statistically  the biggest upset of the tournament so far  <BRK>after a back and forth opening   minute  uc irvine went on a     run midway through the second half and then held off a late charge from kansa state to secure the first ncaa tournament win in program history  the anteater  only previous trip to the dance wa in    where  playing in another   v    game  they let a late lead slip away in what would ultimately be a heartbreaking     loss to louisville <BRK>the win wa the  th straight for uc irvine  which improved to      only wofford  which face kentucky in a second round matchup on saturday  ha a longer active winning streak  <BRK>for kansa state  the upset loss wa a brutal end to a seaon that had so much promise  bruce webber returned just about every key piece from a team that made the elite eight a year ago  and a a result  the wildcat began     a the no    team in the ap poll  despite some ups and down  k state ultimately won a share of the big   regular seaon title  just it second conference championship of any sort since    now their seaon is over after a one and done effort in the tournament for the first time since    <BRK>   oklahoma<BRK>oklahoma saved it most impressive performance of the season for it season s most important game  the sooner scored a season high   point and shot their second highest field goal percentage      percent  in a   point stomping of  th seeded ole miss  not bad for an ou team that entered the tournament ranked  th in the country in effective field goal percentage <BRK>it s strange to think that oklahoma s most impressive postseason offensive effort of the last five year came via one of the team that didn t feature buddy hield or trae young <BRK>   oregon<BRK>for the second straight day we had a   seed not just beat a   seed  but dismantle them  <BRK>a meaningless three pointer at the buzzer by wisconsin s walt mcgrory is the only thing that kept this game from featuring the largest margin of victory ever for a   seed over a    the record still resides with eastern michigan  which beat mississippi state by   in    murray state came up one basket shy of breaking the record itelf on thursday in it     beatdown of marquette <BRK>   houston<BRK>against what on paper appeared to be a dangerous georgia state squad  houston looked like a team a lot of people are going to wind up wishing they rode further in their bracket  the cougar held the typically high scoring panther to just     percent shooting from the field  and rolled to a dominant     win  <BRK>not that kelvin sampson wa always pleased with the effort  <BRK>houston basketball coach kelvin sampson just wrote  mistake  on the whiteboard pic twitter com qeh kfmspl<BRK>after going   year without a single win in the ncaa tournament  houston ha now advanced in back to back year  they seemed destined for the sweet   a year ago before a string of missed free throw and an answered prayer from michigan s jordan poole sent them packing  twelve month later they re going to be favored to take down ohio state and advance to the tournament s second weekend for the first time since phi slamma jamma took the coogs all the way to the national title game in    <BRK>   kansa state <BRK>yes  dean wade wa out  and yes  uc irvine wa probably under seeded at    but come on  you had to have seen this coming  if you re the only team seeded better than fifth to lose in the first round  you re going to wear the biggest disappointment crown  <BRK>   virginia<BRK>yeah  i m doing this  <BRK>while the rest of the world is pointing out the return of virginia s march nerve in one breath and praising the cavalier for having the mental fortitude to ultimately exorcise those demon in the next  we re throwing them on the biggest disappointment list  <BRK>it s not that i think virginia showed sign of a forthcoming second round disappointment  i don t   or that i don t respect the cavalier for clearing a mental hurdle they collapsed over a year ago  i do   it s the mere fact that we have to be having this conversation again that s disappointing <BRK>  raise the banner  virginia  pic twitter com gyainbvlxa<BRK>virginia player had a full year of seeing every shitty umbc joke that anyone with access to the internet could come up with  they responded by ripping every team in college baketball but duke and florida state  once  to shred  and that s the thing  we know this team is good  when your body of work is a extensive and overwhelming a uva s  there s no counter argument  there s nothing tangible to point to that provides any sort of cae for the opposition  so if you come out in the tournament and once again don t look anything like the team we ve seen for the pat four month  there s no explanation for it other than it being some weird march mind f k  the exact tired narrative you ve been waiting all year to dispel  <BRK>so naturally  virginia come out and fall behind gardner webb by   point in the first half  tied for it largest deficit of the seaon  i get that tony bennett s system doesn t exactly lend itelf to a curb stomping opening segment  but these guy should have been ready to blitz   or their own personal form of  blitz    whatever   seed wa unlucky enough to draw them at the start of this march redemption tour  instead  the meme came flying a if jairus lyles had never stopped raining three <BRK>it s not a big deal in the grand scheme of thing  especially if virginia look like itself for a full   minute against oklahoma on sunday  but this wa supposed to be the debut of angry virginia  of bad as  done with your shit  hellbent on revenge virginia  that it took so long for any hint of that identity to reveal itself wa disappointing  <BRK>   utah state<BRK>you were probably thinking this spot wa going to go to wisconsin  even though the badger were a   seed that got boatraced by oregon  it seemed going into the tournament like the public felt better about utah state s chance to take care of it pac   opponent than it did about the badger  ability to handle theirs <BRK>that faith wa misplaced  a an aggie team that wa riding a   game winning streak and had been beaten just once since jan    put up next to no fight against a wahington team it wa favored to beat by three  losing an     game is one thing  but utah state looking so clearly inferior from start to finish against an opponent that had just one win over a team in the field of    and only because they lost to said team in the pac   tournament title game by    wa fairly stunning  <BRK>       p m  to     p m   est <BRK>we went   minute without a single basketball game in progress on thursday  and six minute without hoop on friday  some might call that progress  i call it horseshit  <BRK>clean this up  <BRK>   no great finish <BRK>for the second straight day  we watched   game  and not one featured a really high quality  memorable finish  we re not asking for three or four halfcourt buzzer beater  jut give u at least one game deciding moment that make u stand up and yell  that s all  <BRK>you have two day  <BRK>after two day we all start writing about the one and done rule again  <BRK>   the utah state washington crowd<BRK>who are these monster in the crowd that didn t give more of an ovation for this <BRK>utah state s mascot went all the way across the court like this pic twitter com n tj hujgr<BRK>big blue   that s the name of utah state s mascot   walk across the entire g damn court on his g damn hand  and after this colossal feat of skill and strength  he get treated like he just made the front end of a   and   in the middle of a   point blowout  <BRK>you people disgust me  you don t deserve march  <BRK>   first four team <BRK>for the first time since the advent of the first four in    no team that won it opening round game in dayton went on to win at least one game in the main draw of the tournament  arizona state got rocked by buffalo  and north dakota state wa no match for overall no    seed duke  the best opportunity for a first four team to advance came on thursday  when belmont fell to sixth seeded maryland by two  <BRK>   rapolas ivanauskas  eye issue <BRK>no    seed colgate went shot for shot with tennessee for   minute before admiral schofield ripped off a string of clutch shot and the volunteer escaped with a     win  for the rest of their life  every player on that raider team is going to wonder what have happened if leading scorer rapolas ivanauskas had been able to play  <BRK>ivanauskas started the game but looked out of sync during his   minute on the floor  he missed all four of his field goal attempt and committed a pair of out of character turnover  he also wouldn t stop rubbing his eye  and would have a towel draped over his head whenever he wa on the bench  <BRK>ivanauskas didn t play in the second half  and continued to appear noticeably uncomfortable  the announcing crew originally reported that he wa having an issue with his contact lens  but after the game  colgate head coach matt langel clarified that his star wa suffering from pink eye  <BRK> he woke up this morning  and it just wasn t happening   langel said   your heart break for him   <BRK>a forever march memory potentially ripped away by pink eye is just about the most frustrating story imaginable if you re anyone associated with colgate basketball  <BRK>   max hazzard<BRK>with the first round of the tournament now in the book  big west champion uc irvine is the only team seeded higher than  th still standing  the no    seed anteater are still dancing thanks to a     upset of kansa state in san jose thursday afternoon <BRK>arguably the biggest contributor to that upset wa junior guard max hazzard  who tied for the team high with   point  and hit multiple clutch three pointer in the game s biggest moment  all that s well and good  but it wa the way in which hazzard handled himself throughout the day that solidified his spot on the cheer list  <BRK>first  hazzard hit a three just before the halftime buzzer to tie the game at    and then without hesitation sprinted back to the locker room <BRK>hazzard tie it at the half    marchmadness pic twitter com cm q czqp<BRK>about an hour later  hazzard hit an absolute dagger from the corner and then struck a pose <BRK>max hazzard and the anteater are hungry    marchmadness pic twitter com islyvjgl x<BRK>finally  hazzard gave a postgame interview that made it overly apparent that knocking off kansa state didn t even come a a mild surprise to him  <BRK> big time player are supposed to make big time play  max hazzard    pt  speaks with  rosgo  after no    uc irvine knock off no    k state  marchmadness pic twitter com vnxwtpanc <BRK>max hazzard forever  he and the rest of the anteater now get  th seeded oregon on sunday with a trip to the sweet   on the line  <BRK>   the   seed <BRK>turn out the report of the     upset s demise had been greatly exaggerated  <BRK>the most famous  or infamous  upset in the ncaa tournament had happened just three time over the last four year  and   seed were coming off an   for   performance in    that trend evaporated over the last two day with three     upset  including a pair that now rank second  murray state over marquette  and third  oregon over wisconsin  on the list of the most lopsided   over   win of all time  in all  the   seed outscored their   seed counterpart by a combined score of      <BRK>this is the fifth time in tournament history that three   seed have won in the same year  the big dance ha never seen a clean sweep by the   seed  something which would have occurred if new mexico state had scored two more point against auburn on thursday   <BRK>   the   seed     for a half<BRK>the three no    seed out of the acc all took the court on friday  for all three  it took a half of basketball where they were thoroughly outclassed by their   seed counterpart before they woke up and played like they were deserving of being on the top line  <BRK>these were the halftime score of the three   v    game on friday  <BRK>    gardner webb        virginia   <BRK>    duke        north dakota state  <BRK>    iona        north carolina  <BRK>a expected  any dream of back to back year with a top seed failing to win a game in the tournament were put to bed early in the second half of all three game  even so  shout to the   seed for letting u all fire off some c  attempt at humor on twitter  and for giving u way more entertainment than we were expecting coming into any of these game  <BRK>gonzaga  for what it s worth  led fairleigh dickinson     at the half on thursday  <BRK>   the tacko dagger <BRK>friday night  for the first time in college baketball history  we saw a     center make a shot that could justifiably be referred to a a  dagger  <BRK>tacko fall    and hit the and      marchmadness pic twitter com ydgunkn ah<BRK>i asumed a healthy amount in the statement leading into that video  i can admit that  if you present me with factual proof of a     college baketball dagger that preceded tacko s within the next   hour  well  i m going to ignore it because i don t want to have to go back into this post and make any change  it s a whole thing and this weekend is busy enough a is  <BRK>anyway  let s keep our eye on the bigger picture here  now we get zion williamson v  tacko fall on sunday  it wa one of the thing we wanted to happen heading into the weekend  and it s happening  celebrate accordingly  <BRK>   the pac  <BRK>a recently a a week ago  it seemed possible that the pac   would be the first power conference since the tournament expanded to get just one team into the field  and even if they got two  there were many who were set to make the cae that this wa still the worst power conference in the history of college baketball <BRK>with the league already having three tournament win under it belt  that s going to be a hard case to make now  arizona state  which knocked off st  john s in dayton on wednesday  had no answer for buffalo on friday  but washington and oregon both breezed past better seeded team in game their opponent were favored to win  <BRK>it s not quite a redemption story for the league  at least not yet   but it s certainly an effective counter argument to any  worst ever  claim  <BRK>   kenny wooten  oregon<BRK>when wisconsin tightened thing up midway through the second half  kenny got hot and put the badger to bed  <BRK>quack attack pic twitter com ew okpslu<BRK>   robert woodard  mississippi state <BRK>somehow  despite a billion pedestrian highlight being posted all over the internet  the only way to view robert woodard s one handed put back dunk against liberty is by viewing it on the ncaa s official website  so you can do that here  it s cool  <BRK>   rj barrett  duke <BRK>there wan t a much showtime a you would have expected going into a game featuring this duke team against a   seed  but this wa a nice moment  <BRK>showtime   marchmadness pic twitter com dht hilcsc<BRK>   r j  barrett and zion williamson set a new duke record for point by a freshman duo in an ncaa tournament game  they also combined for the best photo of march so far  <BRK>    admiral schofield s clutch shooting in the final minute hushed colgate s run at an upset <BRK>   max hazzard sank kansa state with a corner three dagger  and then wanted to let the moment marinate for a second <BRK>  i think this year you saw the growth of this team  nobody panicked  last year it wa like   oh shit  this may happen   we all panicked  this year we were like   oh shit  this is going to happen again   but nobody panicked    virginia g kyle guy<BRK>  uc irvine folk live in the shadow  live like little brother to ucla and sc and maybe some others    cal  stanford  san diego state  well  little brother ha been in the weight room  getting better  getting ready for a chance like this  so i m really happy for these player to be able to work so hard for something everybody can see and then accomplish it  but i m also really excited for the fan of our program who also seem to have endured feeling like little brother  you know  we need to stick our chest out a little bit right now  i believe    uc irvine head coach russell turner<BRK>  i won t allow it  i won t allow him to put me on one of his highlight tape    ucf center tacko fall on facing duke s zion williamson in round two <BRK>  probably the thing i despise more than anything in basketball or in life is somebody trying to be cool    north carolina head coach roy williams trying to explain his team s lackadaisical performance in the first half against iona <BRK>  he definitely crossed part of my mind a few time  i wish that he wa here  but i hope he s proud of me    uc irvine s collin welp on his father  christian welp  who wa a
