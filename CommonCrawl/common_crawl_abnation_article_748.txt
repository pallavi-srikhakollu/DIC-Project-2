this week at the nfl s annual league meeting  the fate of america wa at stake  the   team voted on a handful of rule for the upcoming nfl season  but none wa more important than the overtime rule that the chief proposed  <BRK>under the current rule  if the first team with the ball score a touchdown on it opening possession in overtime  then the game is over  this new proposal would change that  <BRK>by kansa city  to amend rule   to     allow both team the opportunity to posse the ball at least one time in overtime  even if the first team to posse the ball in overtime score a touchdown      eliminate overtime for preseason  and     eliminate overtime coin toss so that winner of initial coin toss to begin game may choose whether to kick or receive  or which goal to defend <BRK>eliminating overtime for preseason is a smart idea  and the winner of the initial coin toss getting to pick whether it kick or receives in overtime is cool too  but those aren t the most important part here  <BRK>the first amendment the chief suggested is golden and just make too much sense  each team absolutely should get the ball in overtime   even if the team that open the overtime period with possession score a touchdown   <BRK>the current overtime system is better than the outright sudden death overtime in the early  s when a field goal would end the game  but we still haven t perfected this thing  <BRK>the team that win the overtime coin toss end up winning the game about   percent of the time  while it s fair to say that the defense should just stop the opposing offense from scoring a touchdown  we all know that the current nfl rule heavily favor offense being able to score touchdown <BRK>from the top   free agent  to mock draft  to scouting report  we ve got everything you need to get through the offseason  all in one place <BRK>wouldn t you have loved to see patrick mahomes and the chief  offense get a chance to match the patriot  touchdown in overtime of this year s afc championship game  or aaron rodgers get one more shot to lead the packer against the seahawks  defense in the   nfc championship game  or matt ryan and the falcon getting the ball for one last drive in overtime of super bowl     don t mind me  just a hurt falcon fan still   <BRK>the chief being the team to introduce this rule change might make them come across a salty over the way their seaon ended  but they do have a point  if the nfl continues to place such a heavy emphais on offense   and that s not going anywhere   it s logical to give both team an opportunity to score a touchdown <BRK>that s a little closer to college football s overtime format  in which the two team trade possession starting at the opposing   yard line  if the nfl pass the chief  proposal  it need   team to approve   then both team at the very least are guaranteed to touch the ball  that s a huge improvement  <BRK>

  <BRK>more importantly  though  the new rule would correct another injustice  that the patriot seem to be the one benefitting most from the current system   especially over the last few postseasons <BRK>super bowl    the   afc championship game against the chief <BRK>that s two time in the past three playoff that the patriot have won the coin toss in overtime and then won the game without the other team getting the ball <BRK>in both season  nfl fan were robbed of mvp quarterback getting a chance for a last drive to show why they were awarded the league s highest individual honor in the first place <BRK>instead  we watched the patriot zip down the field for a quick score and end the game  either a super bowl champion or a a prelude to it  it s anticlimactic   there s always a sense of dread when tom brady and co  get the ball in what wind up being a sudden death situation  <BRK>of course  proponent of the current overtime format can just point to the nfc championship game this season between the new orleans saint and the los angeles ram  the saint won the coin toss  but drew brees threw an interception on their first and only drive  which sealed the ram  trip to super bowl   <BRK>it wa a great ending that showed defense can still make game winning play  but do we really want it to come down to that  do we want these game to come down to a turnover  which is one of the more infrequent play in football  touchdown are more likely to happen than turnover   there were     offensive touchdown compared to   turnover in   <BRK>there isn t a guarantee he team that lost the overtime coin toss will score a touchdown  but it should at least get the chance  <BRK>the overtime proposal didn t get passed for now  but the league will reexamine the rule change in may at it spring meeting <BRK>kansa city s ot proposal wa tabled and denver s onside kick proposal wa defeated  i m told <BRK>steelers head coach mike tomlin said that they ll likely just get rid of the overtime coin toss  <BRK>mike tomlin said the chief are probably going to amend the ot proposal so it doesn t include so many item  chief want both team to get a possession  to eliminate the coin toss  and to eliminate preseason ot  they ll probably get rid of the coin toss part  http   t co uyvrm ccqg<BRK>do the right thing  nfl  give both team the ball in overtime and watch the sport flourish <BRK><BRK>
