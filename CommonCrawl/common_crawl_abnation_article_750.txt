a we all start to contemplate the   college football seaon  one team make me feel more conflicting thought than anyone else  texa a m  <BRK>in the same thought stream  i can justify the aggies a a dark horse playoff contender and then decide they re actually losing four game  about their customary amount these day  <BRK>so  here are some argument for a m a a   contender and some argument against it  whether you like a m or not  there s probably something here for you  <BRK>a m wa never in serious playoff or sec contention in    that s because the aggies decided to play clemson in week   and had to play alabama in week    <BRK>that obscured how consistently solid the aggies were in jimbo fisher s first year  out of   game  they only played one real stinker   a     loss to mississippi state  when neither the offense nor defense got into gear at all  outside of that  th percentile performance by s p   a m wa above the  th percentile  adjusted for opponent  every game and above the  th percentile six time  if the aggies didn t play the country s no    schedule  again per s p   they d have exceeded their     record by at least a game or two  <BRK>someone might counter that a m only finished the season ranked because it won the silliest  longest game of the year in seven overtime against lsu   on a night when s p  only gave the aggies a   percent win expectancy  fine  but the aggies  second order win total against that schedule wa exactly    so it s hard to say they got away with anything  <BRK>worse  the clemson game s in death valley in week    barring a huge  immediate leap  that s going to be a loss  because the tiger are a juggernaut and not slowing down  <BRK>at least this year s bama game  in week    is in college station  where the aggies have a marginally better chance at an upset  <BRK>but even if the aggies turn out to be awesome  they re going to have to pull at least one huge upset to stay in the playoff race beyond october    losing to bama probably ax any sec hope  too  because good luck wishing for the tide to lose twice in conference   <BRK>it s easy to be bullish about a m s ability to score ton of point  the aggies were  th in offensive s p  in    they re slated to return  with next year s eligibility listed   <BRK>sternberger s a huge loss  williams might be  too  but it s not that hard for team with good offense to fit in good running back  and a m ha a trio of rising former blue chip receiver for mond to throw to in jhamon ausbon  quartney davis  and hezekiah jones  <BRK>a rosy a that picture is on offense  it s not hard to look at the defense and worry  of the top six tackler lat year  five were senior  and the other   starting strong side linebacker tyrel dodson   declared for the draft  the defense wa fine overall  finishing  th in s p   but it lagged behind the offense and wa most responsible for loss to clemson  bama  and auburn  now it s losing all of it most statistically prolific people  <BRK>a m wa  th in s p  against the run and  th against the pa  the aggies were an awful  th in marginal explosiveness allowed against the pa  even a they were  nd in sack rate  the front got after qbs well  but offense still hit a lot of home run  <BRK>most of the key player from the front  who racked up most of the tackle  are gone  but the secondary might only lose one starter in safety donovan wilson  who wa hurt at the end of the year  the other starting safety  derrick tucker  is a former four star and will be a junior  charles oliver  another former four star who play corner  will be a senior <BRK>and defensive back is one of the great strength of the   signing class  two four star corner are joining up  erick young  a big  talented prep prospect out of fort bend  texas  rush  and elijah blade  the no    juco corner in the country  two of the top seven safety in the high school class  brian williams and demani richardson  are coming too  <BRK> click here to read williams  explanation of how he built emu into a dynasty in ncaa football    if he can do that  he can cover physical tight end in real life  i d say   <BRK>the class is no    in the country ahead of the february signing day  the other sec west contender are adding lot of talent  too  but a m s incoming class is notable for how cleanly it piece could fit in exactly where the aggies need them  <BRK>it s still early to guess at exactly how quickly those player will help  but where a m s depth chart is tenuous  there are a lot of eventual reinforcement on the way  and that s all pending any additional signees in february  <BRK>everything i just typed above might wind up not mattering much until   or    <BRK>braden mann is a legend  <BRK>fisher s a championship coach  the offense should be great  the defense should get help where it most need it  the schedule s brutal  but stranger thing have happened than a m beating one of bama and clemson and mounting a special run  <BRK>aggies <BRK><BRK>
