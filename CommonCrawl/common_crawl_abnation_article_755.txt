about     p m  today  a large crack in the chicago white sox universe opened up <BRK>manny machado s deal  a  feinsand first reported  is for   year and    million with an opt out after the fifth seaon a monumental deal    the single biggest free agent contract in american sport history and now every eye in baeball turn to bryce harper  his move <BRK>larry wa quick to post the awful news  and let s address that  first <BRK>there is no possible interpretation of what apparently went down over these pat few day with manny machado a anything le than catatrophic to the future of the chicago white sox <BRK>a major market  american league  dh capable  team  with boundless money to spend  more on that later   lusting after him for two year now  fails to deliver the good <BRK>we can gobble a many sour grape a we want <BRK>if you re down with any of these notion to rationalize the colossal failure of today s development  look hard in the mirror  because you re fooling yourself <BRK>no system  even that of the vaunted padre  can fill all gap  with trade market seemingly dead this offseason  free agency wa the way to go  machado  with zero third base prospect in the upper pipeline who can be counted on for the white sox  wa the fit   not bryce harper  or dallas keuchel  or craig kimbrel <BRK>the white sox needed this  nolan arenado ha been an enticing name for fan  but with machado s deal setting the market  no way colorado let him get away  so pack that one in dry ice <BRK>it s luis curbelo watch    baby <BRK>the good news is that there wa still a way to spin this that s not so bad for the white sox  <BRK>unfortunately  the utter fumble of a financial negotiation bat such a notion right down <BRK>if machado had truly preferred san diego  or the nl  or just didn t want to be in the spotlight and preferred to be johnny siesta instead of johnny hustle  ok  it suck to be left at the altar  but fine  good riddens  you jagoff <BRK>but that s not what happened  the white sox offered eight year and    million guaranteed  per ken rosenthal        million per season <BRK>the padre offered   year and    million      million per season <BRK>catbird seat  right  nibble at the corner  shift a few incentive  and welcome to camelback  manny  right <BRK>but then    <BRK>ken williams   we could not go that   m level  <BRK>everyone championing the white sox bid a the better one  whether for the bigger aav or supposed  incentive  that could have  maxed out  the contract at    million  get outta here <BRK>if you want the guy  pay the guy  <BRK>if you want the guy  pay the guy <BRK>if you want the guy  pay the guy <BRK>so  you ll go     but not      it make zero sense  this isn t a bargain basement extension for jos√© abreu that you can load up with beyond belief incentive to turn a     into a possible     <BRK>rick hahn called the white sox offer  superior to what wa offered     in certain way   which is technically true  disingenuous  but true <BRK>this is future hall of famer manny machado  at the prime of his career  play every game  capable of an average shortstop  the second toughest defensive position on the field  and an otherworldly third  no small potato  either  hit the bejeezus outta the ball <BRK>beyond even that  san diego s contract ha a player option after five year  if manny is a hall of famer  and baseball s salary structure continues to shoot northward   neither being lock  but both safe bet  the padre just gave manny not      but     <BRK>a larry pointed out in one of eight gajillion comment on his breaking story  among all the  incentive  offered manny  initially we didn t know whether any sort of option wa in the white sox deal  given the difference between the chicago and san diego offer  i d say it wan t   certainly not a player option only <BRK>lo and behold  by evening  we learned via bruce levine that no  there wasn t any sort of option  mutual or otherwise  in the white sox offer  further  the white sox  don t believe  in them  a fact that probably took them out of machado or harper bidding from the get go <BRK>so the white sox  for all their pride at being  at the table   behaved like they were at the kid  table <BRK>and while there s a possibility that manny didn t give the white sox a chance to match or beat san diego s offer  that run counter to the logic that ha kept him out of uniform into the start of spring training  of course the white sox could have matched or beaten   they simply chose not to <BRK>the notion that ken williams wa  shocked  at machado s decision  and needed to wear his shade to cover up his emotion  that s pure eyewah  a michael scott level of bad acting <BRK>worst yet   and to be fair  we haven t gotten any breathless  craftless      word  oral history of the machado signing  yet so we don t really know if this bottom is the true bottom of the story   wa williams  rationalizing of his club s  spending cap  of          million <BRK>williams on the padre going to    million   that level wasn t feasible to u becaue we still have to project  putting together a total winning roster and keeping the young player  that will ultimately earn into greater dollar themselves  <BRK>williams put his undercutting of a machado offer off on young guy who are busy getting their service time manipulated in the minor  e g  eloy  the real lucky one don t even know that they re good enough to have their service time manipulated  yet  <BRK>thus at least part of the rationalization for not signing machado is that one day  the white sox may need to pay younger player big money  at this point  no earlier than     and presumably  some of them will be run off by management in chris sale fashion before then <BRK>however the white sox get sassed on this site  personally i ve always been inclined to defend the team  first  they re my team  so of course i ll see sunshine before cloud  second  some of the criticism of the player  ownership  performance tends to get out of hand and  at least until the start of this decade  wa driven by sheer medium bias in the city <BRK>today  well  it s an embarrassing day to be a white sox fan  not a sale scissorsing embarrassment  or an adam dunn contract choke  or an ozzie expletiving way  that stuff is just the cost of doing business  in my book  this development today is like getting beaten up by your little brother  in a fight that wa over before it began  <BRK>the white sox had no business being outbid by anyone for machado  that the padre did so  the freaking win nothing  criminal gm  nothing market padre   it s hard to bear <BRK> we should be proud of the aggression and creativity of our offer   hahn said today  huh <BRK>most of u will continue to watch  cheer  hope  shooting to avoid another   loss is something  right  but watching the team you love crumble or cave before your eye is going to be very  very hard to forget  <BRK><BRK>
