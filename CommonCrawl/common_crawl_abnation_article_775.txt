recently  i wa scrolling through a rather interesting comment board here at btsc about possible trade destination for pittsburgh steelers disgruntled employee antonio brown  some suggestion seemed plausible at the time  some not so much  it wa all basically thought provoking insight and opinion  providing each participant with a forum to vent some pent up frustration concerning ab s strange behavior and uncertain future in pittsburgh <BRK>i had read earlier in the day on another site that the dallas cowboy were rumored to be interesting in entering the ab trade talk  so i suggested trading antonio brown straight up for cowboy lb leighton vander esch  i wa only half serious at the time  realizing that it all wa probably wishful thinking on my part  i rationalized that the steelers need to get a proven performer to help offset the huge loss ab s absence will have on the field next season  even a early first rounder isn t guaranteed to be an immediate contributor  and the steelers need any newcomer to contribute sooner rather than later <BRK>my topic of discussion wa quickly dismissed by a devil s advocate who questioned why any rational gm would consider trading a young stud linebacker for a troubled wide receiver past thirty year of age  then a btsc friend entered the fray and tried to defend my sanity  he said i wa only dreaming  while i always appreciate the support i get on this site  that statement got me thinking <BRK>i may be crazy  but i shouldn t be the one dreaming  the dallas cowboy are the one who should be pinching themselves  the cowboy have the perfect opportunity to dream big this off season  trade for antonio brown and reclaim their position at the center of the nfl universe  <BRK>the cowboy play in the largest  most expensive football stadium in the world  because that is the only way owner jerry jones know how to do thing  he only want the biggest and best  because that fit his personality and ego  his impact wa immediately felt all across the league the moment he purchased the team  <BRK>he brought in the best coach available in jimmy johnson  handed him the reign to the team  and backed away  the rest is history  <BRK>a few great draft  free agency maneuver  and a blockbuster trade later the cowboy were once again nfl royalty and two time super bowl champion  then jerry jones huge ego got the best of him and eventually destroyed a possible dynasty  fearing johnson wa getting too much credit for the cowboy success on the field  their relationship strained and jones eventually replaced him with longtime friend and legendary college coach barry switzer  although switzer wa able to win one super bowl with jimmy s player  and a lot of help from a well compensated steelers qb  the day of dallas domination were over  they haven t been a legitimate contender since that super bowl victory  if you are jerry jones and the dallas cowboy fanbase that particular fact is simply unacceptable  <BRK>however  there could be hope on the horizon in the form of another blockbuster trade  not the kind of lopsided trade that brings one team multiple draft pick needed to build a championship roster  the like of a herschel walker trade may never be seen again  no  this trade would actually benefit both team  <BRK>a presently constructed  the cowboy are a perennial playoff contender  however  they have showed nothing to this point that would suggest they are truly capable of competing for a championship  add antonio brown to that equation and suddenly their threat level go way up  they posse a young established qb for whom ab could become a security blanket of sort  a talented workhorse rb who could share the workload and deflect attention  a wr  who is not an aggressive personality who would threaten ab s number  and an offensive line in need of better health and a little luck to return to one of the better unit in the league  <BRK>now i realize that leighton vander esch had a pro bowl level rookie seaon and appears poised for a long and successful career  but his mere presence doesn t make the cowboy contender  he doesn t create instant credibility and national medium intrigue  antonio brown s presence in a cowboy uniform would do just that  it would be a marvelous union to behold  ab catching touchdown pas in that stadium with that big old star on his helmet just make sense somehow  ab could fall to his knee after each one  looking up at the biggest replay of himself he could ever wish for on the masive screen  feigning humility toward the adoring crowd a he come off the field  only after pointing an acknowledging finger toward the one owner in the whole nfl who really understands him  <BRK>ab and jerry s union would be the talk of the sport world and place the cowboy back in the national spotlight  jerry jones already ha experience dealing with high maintenance diva receiver in hall of famers michael irvin and terrell owen  jerry might be exactly what ab need right now  finally  a franchise  a fanbase  and a ownership group grandiose enough to appreciate ab s self worth <BRK>the steelers would receive young stud vander esch  a player that would instantly strengthen a huge weakness on the defense and become a fan favorite overnight  any fan old enough to have witnessed jack lambert will recognize version     because the length  the wingspan  the instinct  and the attitude are undeniable  if only he wa missing a couple of teeth from an intimidating grill  but nobody s perfect <BRK>jerry jones need to make this trade happen if he want to hoist the lombardi trophy anytime in the near future  there is no better opportunity to make that happen than to trade for a player destined to have a huge star on his helmet  <BRK>the dallas cowboy are the most valuable franchise in the nfl and ab is open for business  sound like a match made in heaven <BRK><BRK><BRK>
