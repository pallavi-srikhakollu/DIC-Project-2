don t let the old man fool you  andre iguodala is much closer to being a dominant player than he is to being someone who should retire  the famouly cryptic  and trollish  do a bit of everything star ha taken great glee in letting u all know he ha one foot out the door  whether it be calling patrick mccaw  my replacement  during the last championship parade  or telling kerith burke that he played well becaue he ha a golf tee time in the morning  <BRK>with just about    of the season complete  it s worth noting that andre iguodala ha been superb  <BRK>andre iguodala  resting tonight  ha finished up his best pre asb season in a few year  played   of   game  dunked   time  shot    from    brought consistent defensive energy iq and is an nba best    off the bench  he s   <BRK>though his per game statistic are slightly lower than they ve been since he joined the team  you can quickly see how good thing are going for iguodala by looking at some of his rate statistic  <BRK>for example  per   possession  the super backup is averaging more rebound        asist      and steal       than at any other point in his tenure here  a anthony slater point out in that tweet above  iguodala ha the best on off point differential for any bench player in the nba  <BRK>he s still not scoring much   even when you normalize his six point per game  it work out to just     point per   possession  this follows a career trend for him though  his scoring ha progressively decreased throughout his career   he wa scoring at around   point per   in his one season with the nugget  and an impressive   point point per   in philadelphia  <BRK>also notable are his extremely low turnover number  currently sitting at a gaudy     assist to turnover ratio  he is tied for third out of the entire nba  this is a welcome contribution to a team that is profligate all too often with their pass  <BRK>harder to quantify  but equally critical to the warrior  success is iguodala s presence a a stable veteran off the bench  coach steve kerr once referred to him a  our security blanket  because of his ability to soothe a game back under control  for someone who is only averaging six point per game  it would be eay to miss his impact  but make no mistake  andre iguodala is going to be critically important to this team in the playoff  if early return are any indication  there s plenty here to like  <BRK>
