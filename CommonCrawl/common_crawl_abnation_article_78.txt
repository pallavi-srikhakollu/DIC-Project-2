the pelican reached a hilarious level of pettiness with anthony davis monday night  davis  who requested a trade ahead of the deadline in february  ha been playing limited minute in limited game due to a peace making effort between the team  which ha no incentive to play him  and the nba  which doesn t want one of it top star sitting out without an injury   <BRK> when davis checked out of the game halfway through the third quarter  that wa probably going to be it for him on the night  he had   point in   minute  which ha been par for the course for him since the pelican declined to move him at the trade deadline   <BRK> but a neck and neck game saw new orleans up one point on the dallas maverick in the final     second of regulation  the mavs had the ball for an in bound pas  and coach alvin gentry sent the     arm of davis out to guard the paser  he hadn t played in over   minute of game time  <BRK> that wasn t the pettiest part  either  the mavs found themselves at the free throw line to take the lead after the throw in  but luka doncic missed the first of two free throw  tie game   <BRK> but when the pel called timeout to set up their final possession of the game with     second to go  they took davis  one of the best player on earth  back off the floor  they weren t going to give him a chance to win the game   <BRK> julius randle ended up taking and missing the final shot in regulation  though new orleans won in overtime       davis played zero ot minute  <BRK> to recap  new orleans put davis back in to play defense  then denied him the chance to help his team win at the end of regulation and in overtime  <BRK> this is the ridiculous level we ve reached with the very public declaration of davis  playing intention and the franchise s decision to not trade him at the time of his request  what a farce  <BRK>
