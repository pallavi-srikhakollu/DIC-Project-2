defensive linemen nick bosa  josh allen  and quinnen williams were the top three pick in mel kiper jr  s first mock draft of the year  that hasn t changed a month later <BRK>espn s nfl draft expert released his second mock of the year monday and still belief that the arizona cardinal  san francisco  er  and new york jet will use their top three selection to add defensive line help  but this time around  he think the oakland raider and tampa bay buccaneer will do the same with the no    and no    pick too <BRK>kiper followed todd mcshay s lead and projected linemen will be each of the top five pick  although mcshay had an offensive lineman at no     <BRK>it would be unprecedented if kiper s projection became a reality  there ha never been four defensive linemen in the top five of an nfl draft before  the last time there wa even three wa in   when bruce smith  ray childress  and chris doleman were three of the top four pick  it s a great year to add defensive linemen  and it could be a historically great draft for the position group <BRK>here are the four most important takeaway from kiper s mid february mock draft <BRK>in january  kiper projected oakland would add cornerback greedy williams and tampa bay would pick alabama offensive tackle jonah williams  those pick have changed to michigan s rashan gary and mississippi state s montez sweat  respectively <BRK>while the raider secondary could use help and jameis winston need better protection  both team could stand to improve up front on defense  dan kadar list edge rusher help a one of the biggest need for the raider and buccaneer in his latest mock draft <BRK>oakland finished the season with a laughable   sack   a total that s only impressive if one player doe it on his own  that s the fewest sack a team ha finished with in a decade  it s a problem that need to be fixed and gary would be a good start <BRK>the need for pa rushing help isn t quite a dire in tampa bay  but it s still an area that need improvement  via kiper <BRK>tampa bay s defense is likely to undergo an overhaul under new coach bruce arians and coordinator todd bowles  and the bucs have to add edge rusher  jason pierre paul had a nice first season in tampa      sack   but he s    former second round pick noah spence  meanwhile  ha just one sack over the last two season <BRK>after the early run  the next defensive lineman off the board in kiper s mock draft is ed oliver at no    overall to the atlanta falcon <BRK>kiper didn t make many change with his quarterback projection  in fact  it wa almost a carbon copy of his january mock a it pertains to pasers <BRK>ohio state s dwayne hakins is still slated to be the first quarterback off the board to the new york giant  oklahoma s kyler murray is paired with the miami dolphin once again  and duke s daniel jones is still pegged a the new england patriot  eventual tom brady successor  the only difference is that missouri s drew lock wa added to the mix <BRK>kiper now ha washington taking the strong armed quarterback at no    overall <BRK>the team is probably going to need to do something at the position with alex smith likely to miss the entire   season due to a gruesome leg injury  wahington wa reportedly interested in trading for joe flacco before a deal wa made with the bronco that caused a ripple effect across the league <BRK>kiper say lock   who he cite a the player who  wa the best quarterback at the senior bowl    could be the solution for wahington instead <BRK>eric ebron is the only tight end to be drafted top   in the last   year  he wa the lion  no    selection in    and it wa a swing and a miss for detroit <BRK>ebron only caught   touchdown in four season with the lion and wa released last march so the team could avoid paying his fifth year option  the tight end then had a breakout  pro bowl year after signing with the indianapolis colt <BRK>in kiper s latest mock  he project the lion will go with the same bold draft strategy that burned them five year ago and take iowa tight end t j  hockenson <BRK>hockenson          is a complete player who can run route out of the slot on one play  then line up next to a tackle and blow up an edge defender in the running game on the next  i m not going to call him a rob gronkowski clone  but there are similarity  particularly when you see each a blocker  and remember that lion coach matt patricia and gm bob quinn saw firsthand what gronk did for the patriot during their time in the organization <BRK>patricia wa hired by the lion last year  and quinn became the general manager in    so neither wa with the organization picked ebron  but it d be understandable if detroit fan were wary of the team taking another tight end that early <BRK>in kiper s first mock draft  the lion took lsu linebacker devin white and hockenson wa slated at no    to the titan <BRK>a month ago  kiper had ole miss wide receiver a j  brown a the first receiver off the board all the way at no    overall  this time he showed the position much more love  although it wan t brown sliding up the board <BRK>instead  it s his freakishly gigantic teammate d k  metcalf who is now projected to go no    to the buffalo bill  another receiver  oklahoma s marquise  hollywood  brown  is three pick later in the mock draft to the green bay packer  <BRK>just a few hour after kiper s mock draft wa released  it wa revealed the latter recently underwent surgery that will keep him out of action throughout the pre draft process <BRK>oklahoma wr marquise brown  a projected top   pick in april s nfl draft  underwent surgery for a lisfranc injury last month that will prevent him from participating in the combine and his pro day  but he still is expected to be ready for summer training camp  per league source <BRK>then it s no receiver until a j  brown at no    overall to the indianapolis colt <BRK>taking a receiver early would make sense for the bill  who gave rookie quarterback josh allen little help in    it d be a more curious decision for the packer  who have big need on defense  although it wouldn t hurt to add a no    receiver to pair with davante adam  <BRK>kiper and dan kadar both believe you should expect to hear a whole lot of defensive linemen get their name called at the beginning of the   nfl draft  they also think new york  miami  and washington will be in the market for new passer in april <BRK>it s still really early though  and there will undoubtedly be plenty of shuffling in the next couple month  at this point last year  kiper still believed josh allen would be the cleveland brown  no    pick and that baker mayfield would be the jet  selection at no    overall  <BRK>
