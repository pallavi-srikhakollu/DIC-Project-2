the load may have leened on saturday  but thursday and friday s trend of favored team winning and more often than not winning easily rolled on  the first day of the second round gave u jut two game decided by le than   point  one upset in term of seeding  no upset in term of point spread  but still a handful of history making performance <BRK>here s what you need to know from the third full day of march madness  <BRK>       lsu        maryland    east <BRK>there s always so much pressure on the first saturday game of the tournament  after two straight day with multiple option going at all hour  fan wake up to a world on saturday where they only have one game to watch between      est  and      it is new  it is strange  and it is jarring  <BRK>if that first saturday game doesn t deliver  there s no plan b  no alternative course of action  nowhere else to turn  real world concern start to set in for the first time since wednesday night  and the feeling is mierable  <BRK>thankfully  lsu and maryland rose to the occasion like spike albrecht in the   national title game  the first half at least   <BRK>lsu controlled the action most of the way  building a   point lead at the   minute mark of the second half  maryland head coach mark turgeon then rolled the dice  switching to a     zone that the terps had played for a grand total     percent of it defensive possession going into saturday  <BRK>the gamble paid off  lsu appeared completely incapable of figuring out the best way to attack the zone  and misfired on   of it next   shot  the tiger  ineptitude allowed the terps to roll all the way back and momentarily take a three point lead  <BRK>this set the stage for a tremendous finish  with both team exchanging big shot before lsu star tremont water got the opportunity to make the biggest play of his life  <BRK>the end of that lsu maryland game     pic twitter com nqqp xixe <BRK>those two shot were nothing new for anyone who ha followed this team throughout the year  lsu s backcourt duo of water and may  who sunk several key free throw to ward off a late rally from yale on thursday  have been clutch down the stretch all season long  the pair are the biggest reason why the tiger are     in game decided by   point or le this season  and why the bad boy hero of the ncaa tournament are marching on to the sweet    <BRK>       kentucky        wofford    midwest  <BRK>this wa supposed to be a clash of kentucky s superior size and athleticism versus wofford s elite crop of outside shooter  that narrative took a hit with p j  wahington not playing for the wildcat and fletcher magee going   for   from deep for the terrier  but the two team still managed to play an entertaining game in the day s second solo time slot  <BRK>the rest of the wofford team outside of magee went   for   from deep  but the story of the afternoon wa the job kentucky did on the most prolific three point shooter in ncaa history  seemingly every time it seemed like the terrier were on the verge of hitting the shot that wa going to get them over the hump and in a position to seize control  magee found nothing but iron  <BRK> i m still kind of in shock   magee said after the game   it just doesn t seem right to end on a game going   for   from    if i go   for    we win the game  i m not sure how that happens  i m sure i won t get over it for a while  <BRK>with wahington out  most of kentucky s inside duty fell on the shoulder of stanford grad transfer reid travis  who just last week returned from a knee sprain himself  travis wa john calipari s most reliable contributor  scoring   point  grabbing   rebound  and knocking down a pair of late free throw to salt the game away  <BRK>       gonzaga        baylor    west <BRK>for the first time in the   year history  internet year  that i ve been doing these post  i thought about leaving this spot blank  none of the game that were played after the first two deserve to be here  michigan florida wa competitive for a half  florida state murray state wa incredibly fun for about   minute  and auburn kansa wa great if you just watched the second half and had no idea what the score wa  <BRK>we ll go with gonzaga baylor  because the bear scored the first   point of the second half to pull within six and then stayed at least somewhat in range the remainder of the way  also    wound up being the third smallest margin of victory on the day  which is incredibly sad  <BRK>in the end  gonzaga comfortably secured it fifth straight trip to the sweet    the longest active streak in college basketball  <BRK>   purdue<BRK>there will be a new national champion in    this thanks to a magnificent saturday night effort from purdue  which dropped an     bomb on reigning national champ villanova in a game that felt over about   minute in <BRK>led by carsen edward    point   the most of any player in the tournament so far   purdue shot a scorching     percent from the field  the boilermakers were just a lethal on the other end of the floor  limiting villanova to just   bakets on   made shot      percent  <BRK>carsen edward   piece    marchmadness    boilerball pic twitter com xlhupmtgkk<BRK>edward  nine three pointer set a new record for a game played inside hartford s xl center  the previous mark of eight wa held ray allen when he played connecticut  <BRK>with the win  purdue ensured itself of a third straight trip to the sweet    the last time the program went to the second weekend in three consecutive year wa all the way back in      that   season wa also the last time the boilermakers played in a regional final  <BRK>   florida state<BRK>the seminole allowed ja morant to get his    point   but made sure to have a game plan in place that wouldn t allow for the murray state star to beat them on his own  <BRK> we came to the conclusion that morant wa almost virtually unguardable   florida state coach leonard hamilton said after the game   so we had to make sure that we defended the other guy that fed off of him  we worked hard and made him earn all his basket  and i thought we did a really good job defending the other guy  and i thought that really made the difference in the game<BRK>a it turned out  morant by himself couldn t come close to toppling the fourth seeded seminole  <BRK>ten florida state player scored in the     blowout  led by mfiondu kabegnele  who once again made his case for the crown of best sixth man in the country  kabegnele dominated the smaller racer to the tune of   point on   of   shooting  seven rebound  three block and one steal  <BRK>   michigan state <BRK>just two day after minnesota torched louisville for   three pointer  michigan state limited the golden gopher to a putrid   of   from beyond the arc  all five starter scored at least nine point for the spartan  who led by   at the break and never really seemed to be in danger of losing at any point during the game  now  after three straight year of opening weekend disappointment  the spartan are finally headed back to the sweet    <BRK>   kansa<BRK>other team lost by more than the jayhawks  but kansa wa the only better seeded team to lose on saturday  when that s the case  you don t really have another option here   <BRK>   villanova<BRK>maybe try guarding carsen edward at some point  at least a little  i know it s easier said than done  but it didn t like a whole lot of effort wa made on that front even after it wa apparent edward wa going to make just about any shot he took after crossing midcourt  <BRK>   florida<BRK>only becaue it feel unfair to put murray state here  and also becaue the other two game on during this time slot became obviou blowout during the first half  and you guy not being able to score at all in the second half left u with nothing to watch  so that wasn t cool  <BRK>   every game after the first two <BRK>this is already beginning to sound like an echo chamber  but it really wa the story of saturday  <BRK>the two early solo tilt did their job  and then not one of the six late tilt could step up in any way  shape or form to help save the day  the six late game were all decided by   point or more and by an average of     ppg  <BRK>i don t know what the record is for most double digit win on a second round saturday sunday  but six ha to be up there  either way  i can t remember a le eventful first saturday night of the tournament  <BRK>   villanova s tournament extreme<BRK>since    villanova hasn t lost during the tournament s second weekend one single time  they ve missed the tournament once  been ousted on the first weekend seven time  and played their way to the final four  and won two national title  in the other three year  <BRK>on top of that  nova s loss in a lot of these early exit year have been hard to explain  now this year the defeat did come at the hand of a team the wildcat were supposed to lose to  but the margin of defeat still nearly wound up making history  <BRK>biggest tourney defeat by defending champ      michigan         villanova    t      utah    t      arizona         san francisco         north carolina         california         michigan st          duke         kentucky    <BRK>hey  but when they re good  they re really good  <BRK>   an unfitting end to fletcher magee s college career<BRK>magee s   ncaa tournament lasted just two game  but the senior guard still experienced both of the emotional extreme that define march  <BRK>on thursday  magee became the ncaa s career leader in made three pointer  he also introduced himself to a new segment of the american sport public by burying   of   trey and scoring a team high   point in wofford s     win over seton hall  the terrier  first ncaa tournament win in program history  <BRK>on saturday  magee played arguably the worst game of his college career  he finished   for   from three  the most shot attempted beyond the arc without a make in the history of the tournament  a magee said himself after the game  if he just play even a slightly below average game  wofford is probably still dancing  <BRK>   live tv butt crack<BRK>even on the concourse  you ve gotta know where the camera is at all time  <BRK>saw this at halftime of the kentucky wofford game and i am dead pic twitter com d b bzpfpv<BRK> bigbuttcracknation <BRK>   the big east<BRK>we still have a full day to go before the end of the tournament s first week  but already the big east is done  not only that  but the four team from the league that made the field of   all went out in pretty embarrassing fashion  <BRK>st  john s got handled by a very average  being nice  arizona state team in the first four       seton hall lost by   to wofford  marquette came within two point of having the largest margin of defeat ever for a   seed in the first round  and villanova  after skating by saint mary s in the first round  posted the second worst defeat ever for a reigning national champion with an     hammering at the hand of purdue  <BRK>   brandon clarke <BRK>clarke  who dunked approximately   time on baylor  became the first player since   and just the third ever to score at least   point and block at least five shot in a single ncaa tournament game  the only other two player to achieve the feat  shaquille o neal and david robinson  not the worst company  <BRK>clarke s   point also set a new gonzaga record for point in an ncaa tournament game  breaking the old record held by adam morrison <BRK>also you can sing his name to the tune of  baby shark   <BRK>i m not even sorry that i sprung that evil on you all out of nowhere  it happened to me in january  and ever since then i ve been waiting for the perfect moment to drag everyone else to hell with me  <BRK>   the return of familiar locker room celebration<BRK>the michigan locker room water fight are back  <BRK>this is what  marchmadness is all about    pic twitter com eaoqceenxw<BRK>and of course the mark few headstand is back

five  gonzaga  year in a row  <BRK>   the favorite <BRK>even though it made for a le than ideal viewing experience  prop to the team who were supposed to get it done on saturday for getting done  and getting it done in style  kansa wa the only better seeded team to tate defeat on the day  and the jayhawks actually went off a a   point underdog against red hot auburn  <BRK>look  if there s anything good coming out of what ha been a pretty lame as opening weekend  it s that all these favorite advancing should set u up with some tremendou contest next weekend  at least that s what i m telling myself  and what you should be telling yourself too  <BRK>   ja morant<BRK>even in a   point defeat  morant deserves a shout  the soon to be top   draft pick did all he could against florida state  but ultimately the superior seminole put an end to murray state s tournament run and  unless you all know something i don t  to morant s college career  <BRK>after his final  amateur  game  morant made sure that a young fan left the xl center with a special memento  <BRK>before he headed to the bus  ja morant went back out into the arena to give his shoe to a young boy  pic twitter com j bsq qhr<BRK>one last piece of history on morant  his season ending saturday mean that he is officially the first player in college basketball history to average at least   point and   assist  a stat which didn t start being tracked until      for an entire season  not bad  <BRK>   jordan murphy s final hoorah <BRK>murphy  undoubtedly one of the greatest player in minnesota basketball history  hardly saw the floor at all in his final game because of a back injury that had him in noticeable agony on the bench  at the end of his team s lopsided loss to michigan state  richard pitino made sure his star got into the game one last time just so he could receive the acknowledgement he deserved from the gopher fan in attendance  <BRK>jordan murphy s teammate show him love in his lat game a a

anybody can  he s virtually unstoppable    florida state head coach leonard hamilton on murray state star ja morant<BRK>  the ride that we ve been on    just doesn t seem right to end on a game going   for   from   when if i go   for   we win the game  i just don t understand how that happens  i m sure i won t really get over it for a while  sometimes that s how the game go  if i would have played a little bit below average  we still would have beat kentucky  it wa just a horrible performance from me  and we lost    wofford g fletcher magee<BRK>  what is he supposed to say  is he supposed to say i m going to dunk on him  he said the right thing  he s a competitor  so obviously he s going to say he ll block my shot  that s basketball    zion williamson on ucf center tacko fall s declaration that williamson won t dunk on him during sunday s game between duke and ucf<BRK>  we were able to make enough shot  but they gave u problem with  the zone   that length really bothered u
