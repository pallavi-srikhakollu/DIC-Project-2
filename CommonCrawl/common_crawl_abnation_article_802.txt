league that serf a a complement to the nfl  part of ebersol s goal for the aaf involves promoting diversity  which includes employing coach who are woman   <BRK> a we look at having not only diverse coach a in minority  but looking at woman and saying   how do we create an environment so organic to football that it s going to promote quality football  but at the same time move the conversation forward    ebersol say of his vision for the aaf    and you can t get much better than jennifer  king   and jen  and lo  we couldn t be prouder of who they are and what they ve accomplished even in this short period of time  <BRK>one of the people he put in charge of just that wa former pittsburgh steelers wide receiver hines ward  who s the head of football development for the league  <BRK> having played football my whole life i ve never been coached by a female   ward tell sb nation   so i wa super excited to be able to sit down on the phone and just chat it up and talk football with

 footballfamily<BRK>a post shared by  dr  jen welter   welter   on feb      at    am pst<BRK>ebersol had known welter for year before he founded the aaf <BRK> one of the thing that wa remarkable to me   there wa a skirmish during a scrimmage   ebersol said of welter   and the coach that wa in the middle of it  like  ripping these linemen apart and pushing them apart is jen welter  with laugh   if that doen t define what she is all about  i really don t know what doe   <BRK>welter add that the aaf employing woman from the get go is another sign of progress being made within the sport   <BRK> it s wonderful to me to see that change   welter say   and to see it being part of the fabric that the alliance football league is all about from year one  <BRK>after playing rugby at boston college  she played and coached football professionally for year  she won a gold medal in   and   with team usa at the ifaf woman s world championship  and played and coached men s indoor football with the texa revolution  in the summer of    former cardinal head coach bruce arians brought welter on a an intern for five week to coach linebacker through training camp and the preseaon  <BRK> i wa excited to have dr  jen welter join my staff a the first female nfl coach for our   training camp   arians  who now is the buccaneer head coach  told sb nation   she wa more than qualified  having played for more than   year <BRK> she brought a totally different way and ideology of how to coach player and did a heck of a job with our inside linebacker  she particularly did a great job assisting larry foote  who wa a first time linebacker coach on my staff  larry worked very well with her and the player accepted her right away  she had a great knack for teaching and getting her point across in a way that really connected with the player  <BRK>welter call her time with the cardinal  one of the coolest time of her life   and credit both arians and foote for setting the tone with how she wa received on staff <BRK> they didn t have short that fit me   welter say lightly looking back at her time with arizona   they hadn t thought about it because they never had a        pound person  regardless of male or female  before  so my attitude wa if the worst challenge we have being the first female in the nfl is some big red short  give me those big red short  <BRK>a far a coaching men go  welter say one of the key is to have fun with player who are adjusting to being coached by a woman for the first time  <BRK> my approach wa alway to laugh a lot   welter say   for example  here we are the linebacker  who are some of the roughest  toughest guy  and being a little bit crazy is part of what make them great  i know i wa one  trust me  if they lost that  because they weren t comfortable with me  that would be terrible  so i alway used to lead with humor in way that i knew would alleviate any tension to let them know that they could joke with me by joking with them first

jan      at    pm pst<BRK>while the internship gave welter masive public exposure both for herself and for other woman looking into getting involved with coaching  welter add it wa important to keep progress moving forward  even a she wa the first  <BRK>since welter s time with the cardinal  the san fransisco  er hired katie sower  who interned with head coach kyle shanahan when he wa at the atlanta falcon  in    kathryn smith served a a quality control coach for the buffalo bill  special team in    king wa a coaching intern for the panther during the summer of    and kelsey martinez wa hired a strength and conditioning coach for the raider in    phoebe schecter ha had coaching internship with the bill for two seaons  and sarah thoma ha been an nfl referee since   <BRK> what wa challenging for woman in football at that time  we couldn t look at football and say  this is where my career is  or  i wanna be the first female coach in the nfl  or at least i didn t because there wa no one i could look at and say  i wanna be her  from a coaching perspective   welter say  <BRK> so the thing that kind of drive me and excites me about that is once it s been done  it can t be undone  and it make it possible for anybody who love football a a female to look at that football field and say  you know i could be her  or be there just like it doe with sarah thoma  or anything that kind of change the culture  <BRK> to me  that wa very exciting and also to know  and i always say this  the responsibility of the first is to make sure you re not the last   welter say   so you  number one  have to do a good job so that they continue to see that it can work  and there can continue to be opportunity  <BRK>welter  who just signed a multi year partnership with adidas and ha launched her own football cleat  is hopeful that fan seeing more woman coaching football this spring during aaf game will promote a cultural shift  too  <BRK> but also it need to be visible and talked about   welter continues   so that for example  something like the aaf when they re starting out  that wa something that wa important to have woman involved  and it change culture from a learning perspective  <BRK>thanks to the trail welter ha blazed  she s lived up to one of her slogan and ha helped  kick glass  for other woman like her <BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK>
