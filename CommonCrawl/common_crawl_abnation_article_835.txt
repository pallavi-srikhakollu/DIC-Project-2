the postseason ban is one of the ncaa s favorite instrument of justice  in recent year  football program at usc  miami  ohio state  ole miss  missouri  and others have faced them  <BRK>some bowl ban hurt more than others  the pain might depend on how good the banned team is  doe the ban cost you a new mexico bowl appearance  a playoff shot  or none of the above  to that end  let s rank every bowl banned team in the history of college football  or at least all those we can confirm got ncaa ban  <BRK>we used the ncaa s major infraction database and searched for fbs equivalent school that faced postseason penalty for case relating to football since the mid  s  when the ncaa got the power to sanction school  the database is messy   some case show up that involved basketball team getting ban in case that also involved football  for instance   but all ncaa bowl ban should be there <BRK>we re not including team that couldn t go to bowl because of restrictive conference rule or decision  we re talking about fbs team that got banned by the ncaa  not specific conference  these are program that caught federal charge  so to speak  not just local one <BRK>these team are loosely ranked by a mixture of their s p  point margin and their final record  with the worst banned team up top  if you find an ncaa banned team we ve omitted somewhere  let u know <BRK>the    beaver were banned by the pac    technically  but we re making an exception off the bat and including them here  because they were so bad it would feel wrong not to tell you about them  they beat what turned out to be a nearly    fresno state team in week    then lost their last   game  at some point  the ncaa officially adopted the pac   s ban  <BRK>the    bearcat used two fcs win to make themselves appear le putrid than s p  say they were  they lost to rutgers by    they had more win than other team on this list  sure  but given whom those win came against and how much the computer hated this team  it s fair to call dave currey s squad the worst banned team ever  <BRK>yet it s also appropriate to put oklahoma state here by virtue of winning zero game  <BRK>the remaining bowl banned squad that won two or fewer game and would ve been double digit underdog against average team  per their s p  rating <BRK>sure  some of the ncaa sanction  especially in the  s and  s  were for relatively ticky tack stuff  but if you re going to cheat  you should expect a better roi than these team  not bad enough to be truly notable  <BRK>just regular ol  garden variety bad  with the exception of   long beach state  a team that had a nice record  but played an atrocious schedule  <BRK>indiana faced a four year postseason ban across most of it sport  but newspaper clipping from the time indicate  in true ncaa fashion  the school didn t know how broadly it applied  the big ten at least banned it in turn from the    rose bowl  and if nothing else  iu self imposed a ban for the next three year by being bad  at least   s ban wa a direct result of ncaa sanctioning  so we ve counted it here  <BRK>the    bama and    usc team look weird here  given their s p  margin  maybe they had ton of unrealized potential and just couldn t close out game due to bowl ban despair  we ll never know  nor would we have if either had won more than four game  because they weren t allowed to play in the postseason  <BRK>through consistent rep  the rebel have learned how to bowl ban properly  you don t want to waste too good a season  but you don t want to be a laughingstock  <BRK>when the cop want people to forget about you  team from the general lower right quadrant of the country know how to be forgotten  <BRK>ideally  when you get hammered by the ncaa  you d like to have built such a strong program that you can withstand the blow and still contend seriously  these team did not display overwhelming promise  but they were solid  prop to   usc for nearly winning the proto pac   <BRK>the ncaa initially banned penn state from the postseason for four year  under legal pressure  the ncaa ended the ban halfway through  <BRK>some of these team were pretty close to national title claim  auburn would ve come close to champ status in   if lsu hadn t gone      clemson wa perfect in    precluding smu  a m would ve been on the doorstep in   if nebraska hadn t gone      wyoming wan t in a powerful enough conference and lost to a blah air force team <BRK>but something like the peach bowl or the fiesta bowl  sure  we could have had   smu in the cotton bowl against a top five alabama  or   usc in the sugar bowl instead of either brady hoke s michigan or an underwhelming virginia tech  <BRK>the    nc state team won the acc but wa banned because the ncaa decided to punish the whole athletic department for baketball infraction  the wolfpack missed out on what would have still  today  been their only orange bowl berth  the bid instead went to duke  the second place team  which got walloped by oklahoma  that stick out a a sad bowl ban  <BRK>first  let s remember that the buckeye were banned because they weirdly decided they couldn t pas up a trip to the   season s gator bowl  where they lost to will muschamp  they were just coming out of the tattoo memorabilia episode that got jim tressel fired <BRK>the buckeye were only ninth in   s p   and they didn t beat a team ranked higher than  th in the final bcs standing  though the big ten championship  from which they were also banned  would ve added a game against a ranked nebraska   if the they had been eligible  they most likely would ve finished where they did in the final ap poll  third  <BRK>of course  the team that played alabama in the bcs title game actually did not play alabama in that title game  according to the ncaa s record keeping  via notre dame s vacating of win  maybe we can pretend ohio state did make the title game <BRK>au doesn t officially claim the title this year  but via recognized champ fsu going      the tiger were one of three team the national championship foundation also called the champ  along with nebraska and notre dame <BRK>auburn won an ap title for the best of it exceptional nine bowl banned season  ohio state ha a claim on this year  but auburn s the truest champ  <BRK>sport reference s simple rating system considers the   sooner the best ever team that wasn t assembled by world war ii s unique roster situation  s p  say the    sooner are much better than any other bowl banned team ever  save for themselves the next year  ou had the country s most legit title claim in        despite finishing it season in november  <BRK>there s little question these were the two most dominant banned team ever  <BRK>
