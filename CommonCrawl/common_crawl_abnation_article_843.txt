nikita kucherov is a good hockey player  like  really good  like  really really good  so good that he s scoring at an historic rate so far this season  and considering the season is   game old  that s quite something  every year  we see player go on ten or twenty game hot streak putting up bucket of point  but the tampa bay lightning star forward ha kept this pace well over two third of the way into the season <BRK>i m normally hesitant to acknowledge  on pace for  stats  they re usually misleading because player don t keep up what they do in small sample over a full seaon  but kuch s outrageous scoring pace ha gone on long enough that we have to start paying attention  and so  for a long a this continues  we ll be checking in at leat once per week on how his seaon is progressing  a of lat night  he ha   point in   game <BRK>before we look at the chart  let s briefly get into the historical context  the scoring environment in the nhl ha changed drastically over the year  wayne gretzky scored over   point in a season four time  no player  no matter how good  will ever do that again because the gap between skater and goalie will never again be that large  to compare kucherov to player of that era would be unfair  instead  we re going to focus on the salary cap era  which began in     after the lost season <BRK>in that time  three player have scored   point or more  sidney crosby scored   in      jaromir jagr scored   in      and joe thornton scored   in      since then  no one ha scored more than evgeni malkin s   in     <BRK>the first chart below compare kucherov to the three player who reached   point  the data here is via hockey reference <BRK>if you didn t know already  the secret is out now  kuch is above the pace of all three of those player including crosby who had a decent lead on the other two through his team s first   game <BRK>for a closer view  the next chart is the same but show only the game to this point in the season  this tighter view make it easier to see how kuch s recent hot stretch ha put him in the lead in his chae of history <BRK>no one should expect kucherov to continue scoring like this for another   game  he ll slow down at some point  but he s done enough so far to give himself a decent shot at having one of the best scoring season in the cap era  he  only  need   point in these final   game to get to    and he need   to set the record <BRK>the lat player to start a seaon this well wa mario lemieux in      well before the cap era  lemieux is arguably the second best player in nhl history behind gretzky  some would even argue he s the best  but his ailment robbed fan of seeing his full glory over a long career  those are the kind of name kucherov is chaing  he s been established a one of the best player in the nhl for the lat couple of year  this seaon  he s trying to put up number that will launch him into the historical conversation <BRK>so sit back and enjoy it  because who know when we ll get to see a player on a run like this again  and for our part  we ll be tracking his chase and keeping you updated <BRK>
