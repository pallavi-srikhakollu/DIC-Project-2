monday s article here on pensburgh by adam gretz about what the penguin have available to trade wa interesting and got the gear going  with the idea of what pittsburgh realistically would be looking to trade away  likely some combination of derick brassard  a   first round pick  perhaps goalie tristan jarry  and perhaps a depth defenseman like jamie oleksiak   the next question becomes   what do they need <BRK>that s where this unofficial   nhl trade deadline outlook will shift  deadline day this year is monday february    so we re now t minus six week from getting there <BRK>one huge  unavoidable piece of good news is that the pen are basically getting a  trade deadline type addition  in about another month  that of course would be justin schultz  one of the team s main defensemen who broke his leg in fourth game of the season  any club that add a right handed defenseman who can skate well and move the puck exceptionally well for zero asset in january or february is going to be very happy <BRK>schultz will bring the body total to nine on the pen  blueline  assuming no one else suffers a major injury from now until the time no    can get back  if so  general manager jim rutherford ha already acknowledged that is too much and will force a decision to be made  <BRK>the easiest path would be to waive chad ruhwedel  who hasn t been needed to play an nhl game since november   and would be even le necessary upon schultz s return <BRK>in order to judge where the penguin might want to add a player  let s turn an eye toward the lineup they re likely to use down the stretch  we ll asume full health  which is dangerous but necessary  since no player a of now are expected to be out down the stretch <BRK>jake guentzel   sidney crosby   bryan rust<BRK>dominik simon   evgeni malkin   patric hornqvist<BRK>tanner pearson   derick brassard   phil kessel<BRK>zach aston reese   matt cullen   riley sheahan<BRK>brian dumoulin   kris letang<BRK>olli maatta   justin schultz<BRK>marcus pettersson   jack johnson<BRK>matt murray<BRK>casey desmith<BRK>healthy scratch  jamie oleksiak  juuso riikola  derek grant<BRK>honestly  the above roster look very deep  it ha a strong top nine forward group  and a player like aston reese who can capably move above a fourth line role if needed  the defense with schultz look a million time better than the patchwork blueline the penguin have had to use all season long  <BRK>but at this point in the penguin  franchise lifecycle   the clock is ticking  crosby  malkin  kessel  and letang are all playing at incredible level  but they won t be there forever  from now until   retires  the best remaining chance to win another stanley cup is likely in    it will be diminished if only slightly in   and then further so in    <BRK>so the pen need to investigate on how to maximize strengthening their lineup to the limit of the salary cap and their limited trade arsenal  washington ha basically the same team that beat pittsburgh in the playoff  and the capital are clicking along nicely  tampa bay is absolutely stacked with talent and depth  toronto s addition of tavares ha taken them to a higher level  if the penguin want to go all the way back  they ll likely have to beat two of these team within the first three round of the playoff  and the best chance to do that is to add more  <BRK>a nice lineup isn t enough <BRK>winger depth<BRK> hornqvist ha had two concussion in the last two month  simon is a nice enough player who score steadily at about half a point per game  but still seems a bit uninspiring in term of total tool and find himself in a top six role often  pearson and rust have been streaky point producer  guentzel and kessel are bedrock player  but adding to the talent level on the wing could be the missing piece to take this team to the next level <BRK>third line center<BRK> there s still a real question to be answered here  do the penguin want brassard in this role  doe he fit well enough  will it work  there hasn t been much on ice evidence to suggest this is going to work out  but there s also unknown availability of a real upgrade  <BRK>micheal ferland<BRK>the pending free agent ha been a popular name in the rumor mill a of late <BRK>via sportsnet <BRK>the   year old also happens to be a pending unrestricted free agent with an extremely manageable salary cap hit of      million  the hurricane are five point back of the final wild card spot in the east  and if the hurricane fall further out of the playoff race they can expect to receive some call on the   foot      pound winger <BRK> all wilson s done between last season and this season is create maybe a mini arm race in term of team now sitting there going   the cup ha to come through the east with the washington capital   so ferland  of course  play a real physical type of role and many team believe that he could fit the bill in term of pushing washington through an eastern conference playoff   kypreos added <BRK>ferland s ability to play the left or right side on any of the top three line  and add some jam and ideally a bit of goal scoring ability  would be an intriguing add for pittsburgh  the price is reported to be a first round pick plus something  which remains to be seen how negotiation and the market would take that first ak  that shouldn t be terribly offputting for an initial report a the seller try to establish a high return  but it would seem incredibly doubtful any team is going to meet that ak <BRK>gustav nyquist<BRK>it would make sense for detroit to move on from the pending free agent and try to get younger  nyquist is quietly having a very good season with   point    goal    assist  in   game and ha been another player to be versatile enough to be an option at left wing or right wing in his career <BRK>marcus johansson<BRK>the   year old is also an impending free agent  and the devil have been down on their luck this season  johansson ha played all three forward position in the nhl  but doesn t play much center anymore  and ha only taken   faceoffs in   game this season   ideally  if he were more of a fit at center  this could be the place to swap brassard out and take a gamble here  but that brings the question if the player available are like brian boyle or marcus johnasson or derick brassard for the pen  why isn t the best player of the three  brassard  the best choice to go with <BRK>jaden schwartz<BRK>i ve long been a fan of schwarz  who is a very guentzel like player  he s small but skillsy with great hand and offensive instinct  schwartz     ha three year left on his contract  it s been reported that the struggling st  louis blue may be looking to shake thing up  so this could be a pearson like situation to buy somewhat low on a young player who is in need of a shake up <BRK>schwartz only ha three goal in   game this season  shooting just     percent  he s been an above average shooter in his career  ending up in double digit  and typically     percent  in every other nhl season he s played  suggesting this slump isn t going to last forever  also  the if the blue are impatient or being brash to make change  they d be worth talking to <BRK>a an nhl player with term  the trade ak here could be too much  trading brasard plus a draft pick and young player  say a simon or an aton reese  might get the pen on the radar  though it would then be worth aking what to do about the hole at center that would be created  and almost no trade chip  or salary cap space  left to use to fill it <BRK>schwartz may be way more fantasy than reality at this point  but then again  it wa impossible to imagine rutherford using a third team in vega to help retain   percent of brassard s contract to make him a possibility  so you never really know with rutherford and the penguin  they can find creative way to get what they want <BRK>the question to answer though is what direction do they even want to go this time around <BRK>
