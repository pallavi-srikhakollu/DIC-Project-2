the los angeles ram are heading to atlanta for super bowl    in part thanks to a no call on what wa a blatant pas interference by nickell robey coleman on tommylee lewis <BRK>lewis wa running a wheel route on third and   from the ram    yard line in the final two minute in a     ballgame  that s when robey coleman just decked the receiver  everyone wa looking for that yellow laundry on the field  and it never appeared <BRK>the notoriously loud mercedes benz superdome wa booming with boo  the ram would eventually force overtime and win      understandably  everybody is pointing to this play a the one that cost new orleans a trip to the super bowl <BRK>that s been a smart way to go about it  if you re the ram  they were going to make enemy whether they owned up to being lucky or not  and sometime honesty is the best policy  this wa one of those time <BRK>here are some of robey coleman s postgame quote  condensed to spare you the other small detail of the play that we aren t concerned with <BRK> oh  hell yeah   robey coleman said   that wa p i  <BRK>     <BRK> i just know i got there before the ball got there   robey coleman said   and i whacked his as  <BRK>     <BRK> i thought it wa going to be a bang bang play   robey coleman said   but when i got up  i thought it wa p i   because i didn t look back for the ball  my teammate were like   think about if you were to look back  that could have been a pick six   because he threw it kind of short  but that didn t happen  i seen his hand go up  and i just hit him  bro  i just hit him  <BRK>honesty <BRK>if you re looking for a reason to be big mad at the ram  mcvay handed it to you last night after the game <BRK>mcvay   the one thing i respect about the ref today is they let the guy play  <BRK>but if you choose to accept thing a they are  that s one of the best postgame quote of all time  the ram were also on the wrong side of some call  making mcvay s quote both petty and true at the same time <BRK>it turned something saint fan would use a  haha see  yeah  this perfectly describes how they cheated   into something even funnier <BRK>now it s   lol  even todd gurley know they got away with one   and  holy shit  he actually posted this  <BRK>  <BRK>a post shared by  todd gurley   tg hunnid  on jan      at    pm pst<BRK>unless my memory serf me wrong  ha certainly happened before   that s probably the best instagram post by an nfl player ever <BRK>there s not a lot for the ram to gain if they were to try and act like we re all moron and deny the obvious  most people would probably be calling them asshole or some such today had they been doing that <BRK>instead  the ram are offering themselves a a nice alternative to root for in the super bowl  they re awesome in comparison to the patriot  who insist that they   five time super bowl champ   are underdog with odds stacked against them  <BRK>and while the saint unquestionably were on the wrong end of the robey coleman play  there are plenty of other instance where the saint got break  including an uncalled facemask on jared goff that would ve given the ram first and goal on a late drive when mcvay settled for a field goal <BRK> ref cost u the game  pic twitter com sjkqbzdirj<BRK>sure  had that pa interference been called  the saint run a few kneel down  and they march on to atlanta  however  there were also other opportunity where the saint could have put the game away  a marcus peter explained <BRK> ram marcus peter on  saint anger over blown pas interference   if they coach run the football on first and second down  they probably ain t even going to be sitting here talking about this      you give sean mcvay the ball back with     or something  we re going to score  <BRK>even in overtime  the saint did get the ball first  and brees threw an interception <BRK>also  remember how sean payton made weirdly exhaustive effort to get taysom hill a touchdown all throughout the game with a trip to the super bowl on the line  yeah <BRK>the more the ram accept the thing for what it is  the quicker they can move past it  and focus on super bowl   in atlanta <BRK>
