on oct        derrick rose scored a career high   point and had the game winning block against the utah jazz  the game came at a point in rose s career when few assumed he could be a capable player again  much le the former mvp he used to be  after being dumped by the knicks  cavalier  and jazz  rose seemed destined to be out of the league before the age of    <BRK>then  tom thibodeau gave rose a chance with the wolf  somehow  rose ha not only managed to find a place in the league  but is having one of his best season ever  a season full of career high and game winner  one in which he say he s playing better than he did when he won mvp in      the   point game essentially marked the start of rose s rebirth  the second stage of his basketball life  away from his history of injury and doubt about his ability to play at the highest level of the sport  <BRK>in the process of celebrating rose s   point game that night  wolf analyst jim petersen said  <BRK> he s got a lot of stuff going on off the court  and i m not a judge  and i m not a jury  and to my estimation  he s not been convicted of anything      but what he is  he play hard  he is a gutty basketball player  <BRK>the last fifteen second of commentary here    whew  http   t co b s j kpf<BRK>the  anything  in petersen s statement is an allusion to rose s   civil trial  in which he and two other men were accused of raping a woman  rose wa eventually found not liable and the woman appealed the decision last november <BRK>but petersen wan t the only person who struggled to properly reconcile that accusation with rose s great game  many outlet decided to side step the issue entirely to praise the athlete  a a way to separate rose s personal life from his baketball career  the ringer confronted the issue  and wrote about the difficulty of asessing rose in the context of the cae  <BRK>the new york time  marc stein celebrated rose s accomplishment that night  before later clarifying the next day he didn t know whether the cae belonged in the same conversation a rose s on court achievement  <BRK>i got swept up a anyone in derrick rose s    i don t know where or if this belonged in lat night s conversation  but november is here so it bear repeating  rose s sexual asault accuser will appeal the   civil trial that found rose and two friend not liable on nov   <BRK>the generous conclusion from that night wa that sport medium and fan don t know how to deal with a good athlete who ha been accused of something terrible  most of the time  the people who cover sport  including sb nation  are tasked with filtering event   win  loss  injury  etc    in term of how they affect a player s narrative  or team s chae for a championship  <BRK>but when that filter is applied carelessly  serious accusation like sexual assault and domestic violence are reduced to  obstacle  that athlete have to overcome  or  those issue are dismissed with the suggestion that sport exist in their own bubble  and those within it have no responsibility to deal with issue that are outside of that bubble  <BRK>if we re being cynical   and more true to the world we live in   it s more likely that the sport world doesn t care enough about sexual asault and domestic violence to treat them with the care they deserve  and  it play a deliberate role in making the conversation go away a quickly a possible  so that athletic achievement can be celebrated guilt free  <BRK>

  <BRK>the coverage of rose s night showed the length that many will go to avoid a moral reckoning with the athlete who they want to applaud  the importance of sport get pushed so high that real world situation are forced into the background  eventually becoming a footnote in the greater sport story  if not invisible altogether  <BRK>the cycle of conversation and redemption for problematic athlete is so rehearsed that it doesn t even need the participation of the athlete to be fulfilled  it work like this <BRK>a soon a an athlete is accued  the victim is blamed for their accual  if they re a woman  they re slut shamed  and whatever the athlete is accued of is reduced to a  mistake   a teachable moment  then  it s suggested that the athlete is a flawed a the rest of u  thu worthy of forgiveness  and that it would be hypocritical not to find forgiveness in our heart  the argument go that we should be able to separate the athlete from the person  which conveniently set the stage for the athlete to be redeemed even a their transgression are surfacing  a soon a the situation occurs  we ve already begun moving on <BRK>after the rah of argument about the flawed nature of human  all the athlete ha to do is have a defining moment or series of game  after which it can be claimed that the athlete ha finally overcome the error of their way  if the athlete isn t convicted of the crime that they were accused of  then that can be used a a shield to keep away any criticism  regardless of the detail of the cae or the well documented issue with the justice system  <BRK>and that s how we end up with petersen saying   and to my estimation  he s not been convicted of anything     but what he is  he play hard   <BRK>when that s done  so is any concern about what the athlete wa accused of  and the complexity of a good athlete possibly doing terrible thing  the athlete is forever redeemed a long a they re good at their sport <BRK>kobe bryant is a classic example of this rebranding  after he went through the process of his   rape case  he remade himself into  the black mamba   a new identity he gave himself that played into his controversial image  he leaned into the villain role  not only were the medium and fan happy to ignore this link between his identity and the case  they helped him rewrite the story  he wa successful in changing who he wa publicly  because the sport world wa eager to assist  <BRK>rose didn t take an active role in rewriting his story  but the machine went on without him  now he s at the permanently redeemed stage  where he is being championed to make the nba all star game  he s the fan vote s no    guard in the west  behind stephen curry and ahead of james harden  and profile of him are being written without the word  rape   though making sure to mention  adversity    <BRK>this is not necessarily a condemnation of rose  or a suggestion that rose cannot have a life after his rape cae  this is a condemnation of a world where those who are taked with telling the story of athlete dismiss and erae anything that encroaches on it bubble when given the chance  there s no attempt to deal with these athlete a complex creature  or even time to let those athlete reflect on what they ve done  <BRK>rather  we engage in a willful and engineered blindness  there s no difficult conversation that might lead to a standard on what we re willing to accept from our favorite athlete  what we have instead is an abdication of that personal responsibility to preserve comfort  <BRK>

  <BRK>rose doesn t have to be condemned forever  and there are nuance in the case that make it difficult to process  rose wan t found guilty  and the appeal didn t go through  but to say there s no space for the conversation about the detail of his case   which included his admission that she never gave consent and did not even know what consent wa   is a dubious position  if that space doesn t exist  it s because some people are more comfortable that way  not because it is an impossibility  <BRK>in the same way that hiding behind the legal system can be a blinder to the complexity of a cae  so is the idea an athlete can be separated from their person  it s an open lie that is postured a intelligent argument  <BRK>the narrative of any athlete is built on the foundation of who they are a a person  or at leat the person they re presented to be  when rose help out the child of chicago  there s no argument about whether those story should be reported  his perseverance over so many obstacle in his life  from environmental to personal  his own personality  are all used to engineer an emotional connection to rose the athlete  there s never a debate about whether those positive part of his life should be separate from his achievement on the court  entire ad campaign are built from them  <BRK>yet  when those element of the athlete s personal life are negative  we feel the need to pretend the athlete and the person are different people <BRK>we need to do a better job of taking the discussion about the moral quality of our favorite athlete seriously  what should be the consequence when they falter  what doe true redemption look like if it can ever be achieved  what personal quality should we separate from the athlete  perhaps then there wouldn t be so much discomfort around how we talk about player like rose <BRK>it s because the general effort of sport fan and medium ha always been to hide from the complexity of athlete a people who are capable of good and bad that the present position on these issue is so embarrasing  transgression don t have to be mentioned every time we talk about an athlete  but they shouldn t be dismissed immediumtely to make way for a more a positive sport narrative  <BRK>only when we stop being concerned with preserving a sanitized image of an athlete can we ever start having honest conversation about athlete like rose  more importantly  and hopefully  we can signal to victim that what happened to them mattered  otherwise  we re actively creating a deceitful world in which we only pretend to care about the problem we routinely dismiss <BRK>
