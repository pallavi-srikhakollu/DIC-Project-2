by building a potent offensive system  lincoln riley ha turned the sooner into a destination for top qb talent  they secured kyler murray s transfer from texa a m with the promise of an open depth chart only for baker mayfield to get one more year  and a soon a murray s sooner career completed  they had both a five star incoming freshman in spencer rattler and alabama transfer jalen hurt <BRK>given that rattler is not an early enrollee while hurt had his choice of great option  it seems likely that hurt wa all but assured a starting position <BRK>hurt ha a different background than the previous two signal caller  though  and he ll have a different process to get through <BRK>over the lat three year  hurt saw significant action in four playoff game and two sec championship game  in those six contest  he never threw for a many a   yard  his result in championship game against clemson    of   for   yard in    and georgia    of   for   yard in    made it difficult for alabama <BRK>the big difference in the championship against georgia wa that tagovailoa could execute rpos  forcing the dawgs to exert le pressure on alabama s run game  for    the tide built their o around tagovailoa s ability in the rpo game  whereas the better hurt  offense in   constrained defense with jalen s leg on shotgun read play  after lane kiffin departed for the fau job  alabama reduced those qb keeper option  which minimized some of hurt  strength and magnified his weakness <BRK>the upshot wa that hurt became a one read and scramble kind of qb  stopping the alabama offense became about forcing passing down  then seeing whether hurt could get out of them  often by scrambling to the right    <BRK>    or not <BRK>in the former example  georgia shifted into it coverage after the snap  taking away hurt  quick post snap read  he s a tremendous athlete and wa able to slip out  in the second example  georgia covered up his quick read and also took away his escape route to his right <BRK>the story on hurt after his junior year mostly spent sitting behind tagovailoa and occaionally running gadget play wa his growth a a paser  with the other comeback win against georgia a the big reveal <BRK>hurt  mechanic and ability to accurately deliver a ball off a quick read have improved  but georgia hadn t prepared to stop him  the main reason georgia went down wa that it did not take away his read consistently and did not prevent him from doing damage on right side rollouts <BRK>taking away hurt  first read and corralling him isn t a eay a it might sound  a evidenced by the wide variety of result defense had against him  hurt rarely move pat the first read and almost always roll right when that read isn t there  yet his ability to throw a good ball and his athleticism in the open field are high level <BRK>in reality  improvement by hurt a a qb are going to be marginal  a a senior who will need to learn a new system and develop chemistry with a rebuilding ol and new wrs  his hand will be full  murray and mayfield had extensive high school and college experience in pas first system and murray had a full year to learn from riley before they took the field in crimson red  not just one offseaon <BRK>the sooner face a rebuild  but not a terrifying one  their graduating offensive guard tandem of ben power and dru samia had   combined start  left tackle bobby evans departed early after starting   consecutive game  and early departing right tackle cody ford wa a first year starter but arguably the best player on the unit  the sooner have been developing along the ol for a long time now  but hurt will probably not play behind the same kind of cohesive unit that he enjoyed at alabama or that mayfield and murray enjoyed at ou <BRK>but at the skill position  the sooner have an embarrassment of rich  hurt will have     yard rusher kennedy brook and up and coming fb te jeremiah hall  he ll throw to     yard receiver ceedee lamb and a deep bench of receiver  including flex te matchup weapon grant calcaterra <BRK>calcaterra figure to take on increaed importance  a it ll be crucial for riley to create play that give hurt quick read  at        pound  calcaterra force defense to answer difficult question about matching up against sooner wideouts  clearing the picture for the qb before the snap on who ll get favorable matchup <BRK>the other obvious direction is to beef up the qb run game section of the playbook  murray ran for     yard in    but he did it on only   carry  many of which were scramble  and the sooner didn t expand their qb run game all that much <BRK>hurt already ha some expertise in the qb gt  pulling guard and tackle  counter run game that oklahoma ha made popular  although alabama often negated it potential effectiveness by attaching fake read to it <BRK>hurt isn t even reading the perimeter for the swing pa fake  he s running all the way  and the previous snap  alabama had run the same play with him throwing all the way  which had led to a semi successful swing pa into unblocked defender  bama might a well have just ran both these play without fake <BRK>of course he s lethal in the qb draw game   <BRK>    which oklahoma mixed in for murray and should expand  back in    oklahoma ran a lot more qb keeper option play with mayfield    carry  in order to get the most out of rb tandem samaje perine and joe mixon  hurt had   carry a a freshman in   and   a a sophomore in    he s strong and ha proved his durability a a ball carrier  if riley can get him up to speed in making good decision on pas or keep rpos  that will allow the sooner to expand an already dangerous portion of the playbook <BRK>hurt  capacity for reading the field and progressing through receiver isn t the same a it wa for murray or mayfield  without their absurdly talented and experienced ol or a more developed pocket paser  the sooner  ability to leverage their depth and skill at wr will be diminished  <BRK>however  if riley can build a run game around hurt  overstress defense with qb option  and create clear read for finding these wrs  then we might still see a much more impressive passer than we saw at alabama and another top oklahoma unit <BRK>
