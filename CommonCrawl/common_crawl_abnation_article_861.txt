panic <BRK>it s such a natural feeling that come over someone when thing don t go precisely a planned  you begin to wonder thing  question thing  thing that you once believed in don t necessarily make sense a they once did when those thing began <BRK>the average sport fan experience panic about their sport team   no matter the sport  football fan might be the most fanatical in any given city   i could be wrong about that  of course  if the city you live in doesn t have a football team   philadelphia ha all four of the major sport covered  plus ml and professional lacrosse   so this town check a lot of box <BRK>panic hit the philadelphia  er fan in different way  the  come a you go  fan might feel differently than your hardcore  trust the process   i ve been here since the  s  sixer fan  they all feel it  though <BRK>the sixer might be      they might be seven game ahead of their     pace last year after   game  they might be fourth in the eastern conference  they might have two all star  or three depending on if someone get snubbed   at any given time  the team ha three of the best ten player on the court to start a game   unless they happen to be playing the golden state warrior  this may lead you to wonder where i m going with this train of thought <BRK>even before blowing the door off the houston rocket last night  there were feeling of dread and or panic among some  why do i say that  could it be thing like this that were posted a week ago <BRK>with a five year     contract stating them in the face  the sixer should consider trading jimmy butler  happy sunday  go bird  http   t co tmmaqocke <BRK>there are some decent point made  he call butler a  malcontent    which is hard to ignore given his tumultuous track record in both chicago and minnesota  there were some offensive cohesion concern that were prevalent  but thing could be on the rise given butler s ortg with the sixer this month ha ballooned to above   <BRK>it also hasn t been three month since the trade  is two month enough  perhaps  just consider this  it s really hard to throw three superstar on to a team together and simply say  make it work  boy  <BRK>it didn t start well for the miami heat when they put a team together with lebron james  dwyane wade  and chris bosh  even after winning two title in three year  the flower on the golden state bouquet of steph curry  klay thompson  kevin durant  and draymond green are beginning to wither this season <BRK>search sixer twitter  sometime  it can be pretty brutal some day  the  firebrettbrown crowd probably annoys me the most   there s no reason to fire brett brown  in fact  my response to those people are always the same   for who  what coach that is available will make this team better   <BRK>why doe there always feel like there s an aura of  what do we do now  with the sixer  that aura lead to some interesting conversation among sixer fan  beat writer  and sixer twitter  so  what cause these feeling  sometimes it s a eay a breaking it down into a solid equation <BRK>after the sixer had an unbelievable   win seaon lat year and winning a first round series for the first time in several year  the sixer lost in five game to the boston celtic  that s not a bad leap to take after year of losing      game  right  i ll grant that  there were super high expectation put on this team going into this seaon  some people thought the sixer could make the eatern conference final  some even thought the sixer a constituted at the beginning of the year could make the nba final <BRK>the team had obvious superstar in joel embiid and ben simmons and had a solid complement of role player in robert covington  dario saric  tj mcconnell  et al  did those expectation cause a hated trade for jimmy butler at the risk of depleting their depth  perhaps  if you re general manager elton brand and you have this budding group of young star but you constantly hear that you need  one more piece   doe that cause you to make  a move  a opposed to  the right move  <BRK>we ll never know becaue none of u  including me  are in that office labelled  general manager  <BRK>expectation can be a bad thing if it set a team up for failure or set a fan base up for disappointment  are we seeing the latter of that  now  the team isn t failing  they re      should the sixer be better  maybe  it s not particularly encouraging that the team is only     against team in the top   of the sagarin rating  rating that include golden state  houston  oklahoma city  toronto  milwaukee  boston  utah  san antonio and portland in the top    <BRK>listen  we all want the sixer to win a championship <BRK>after seeing the villanova wildcat parade down market street twice and seeing the philadelphia eagle parade up broad street lat year  there s always the wonder of  who s next    villanova count a philly  let s not have that damn argument because you won t win   no disrespect to flyer fan  but it s not you guy  barring a signing of either bryce harper or manny machado  it might not be the phillies  either <BRK>the sixer are the next most logical choice <BRK>they haven t been to the nba final since the allen iverson era and haven t won the nba title since the julius erving era  sixer fan are a little starved to put it mildly   to put it quite specifically  we re ravenous pack hunting velociraptor that want nothing more to claw at the larry o brien trophy  <BRK>like eagle fan before last year and phillies fan before    sixer fan want a championship so bad  part of that is because it s the nature of the philadelphia sport fan to be more passionate than any other sport fan  the other part is to prove to the nba and adam silver that sam hinkie wa right   we don t need a championship to prove his method were right  it just help the argument  <BRK>here begin the flip side to the equation <BRK>when you looked at the sixer roster and move at the beginning of the off season to the start of the regular season  what wa your honest  bonafide prediction <BRK>playoff  eastern conference final  nba final  champion <BRK>in the interest of objectivity and full disclosure  my prediction wa eatern conference semi final and maybe going seven game instead of five  toronto got better with the addition of kawhi leonard and the switch to nick nurse a head coach  the raptor kept their depth in tact  and that s a large reaon why they re the most balanced team in the eat <BRK>i said it when he wa hired  mike budenholzer plus giannis antetokounmpo wa ridiculously scary  antetokounmpo wa already really good in his first year in the league  but now he ha a legitimate nba coach instead of the jason kidd joe prunty faux nba mensa brigade  the greek freak went from a coach that once intentionally spilled liquid to facilitate a time out to a coach that won   game with al horford and paul milsap <BRK> yeah  that happened  mike budenholzer guided a team led by al horford   and paul milsap to   win  <BRK>it wa a fluke and those atlanta hawk were bounced before reaching the eastern conference final  but  coach budz  is a legitimate coach <BRK>the boston celtic beat the sixer in five game in the east semi last year  and they did so without kyrie irving or gordon hayward  the sixer are     against boston this year  so thing haven t changed much  even joel embiid said   it s not a rivalry becaue they always beat u   the indiana pacer are the fourth team in that gauntlet  they don t have the name that the celtic  raptor  or buck have  but they re still well coached and are currently third in the east despite getting waxed last week by the sixer in indiana <BRK>take all of that into account  and yeah  seven game in the eastern semi wa the best i would have predicted for this team  win or lose  <BRK>some people are le objective than i for whatever reason you hold  and that s okay  that s all it take for any rational fan to become irrational when it come to their team  i don t have le faith in the sixer  but i do try to be objective when i can <BRK> before writing for liberty ballers  i had a blog and a podcast called  the realist   so that should say something about who you re listening to right now  <BRK>the definition  alone is enough to illustrate why it is so important in situation like this for any sport fan <BRK> the action of thinking about something in a logical  sensible way <BRK>the two key word in that definition are  logical  and  sensible   when you have those two thing  you don t write thing like the sixer should trade jimmy butler at the trade deadline  for example  you don t start to think about what the trade market is for ben simmons   anyone with those thought will be fired into the sun if they are in my vicinity  by the way  <BRK>honestly  what trade are you going to make for jimmy butler  or anyone else  that make this team better this season <BRK>what trade are you going to make that doen t set your franchise back for the future  trading butler for     cent on the dollar make no sense  trading ben simmons for any amount make no sense  unless the return is anthony davis   there s a lack of reasoning  let s say they send him to miami for josh richardson and kelly olynyk  doe that make the team better this season  not really  how about down the line  maybe  maybe not <BRK>what if the sixer sent simmons to portland for cj mccollum or some other nonsensical trade  that s just short sided <BRK>sure  i understand butler can walk after this seaon for nothing  and we re left graping at his dust trail a he leaf town like he wa the road runner  that doe mean we re in the same situation to start next seaon a we were lat year with le depth  yes  some people  looking at you kevin o connor from the ringer and others like him  say simmons need a jump shot  i don t disagree  but let s not act like that s the final thing that unlocks this team s destiny  they still need a bench  they still need to consistently beat top team <BRK>what if butler walk   i m sorry to harp on butler  by the way  i really hope he stay  but there s the possibility he won t   maybe the sixer get someone with butler s max cap slot that is a better fit  maybe my dream come true and klay thompson is in a sixer jersey  maybe  it s khris middleton  maybe  even   it s kyrie irving   i know  i know  that s sacrilege to think about  but it make sense  ok  you don t want the stink of a former celtic  kemba walker  then  <BRK>some of this contains thing that you may not want to hear  it s objective  it s not  carry the torch for the home team no matter what    which ha been so familiar to me and many of u  it s also a reminder to not succumb to the feeling of dread and or panic when it come to the sixer <BRK>they re still really good <BRK>they will still be really good for a while  so enjoy every second <BRK>it s not  repeat not  the end of the world if they don t go to the nba final this season  if that wa your expectation  <BRK>a cristian crosby say before every home game   this is our house  this is our team  this is our city  <BRK>we re alright  everyone  and we will continue to be alright <BRK> trusttheprocess<BRK>
