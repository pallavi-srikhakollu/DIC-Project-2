marcus smart inked a four year     million deal with the boston celtic last summer  inciting some like sport illustrated s jeremy woo to declare it a  coup of a contract   smart attracted little market leverage against boston beyond feigned interest from the king  unbacked by an offer sheet  <BRK>after a frustrating wait for an offer  the money he ultimately received could ve stemmed from smart s unique value to the c s or to make that contract work better in future trade  no matter boston s reason for not sucking every dollar out of him  smart tipped his cap back to the celtic by saving their season in the first half of      his vocal leadership rang loudly  but that s been a mainstay on the team <BRK>now  his consistent play back it all up <BRK> he s been willing to step up and say thing since he s been here   said brad stevens earlier in the year <BRK>it took   game for smart to receive   minute a a starter in jaylen brown s absence against the pelican on november  th  that date will stand a an eaily identifiable turning point for a nba final contender that stood at     arriving in new orleans <BRK>smart  who ha started every game since  proved in a    effort that he may not be a player capable of catapulting a team to championship contention alone  but that he s an equally important binding force  <BRK>five all star caliber player  previously unable to gel enough to beat the knicks  maverick  magic and jazz  twice   needed his defensive direction  assertiveness  and secondary ball handling to reach their potential <BRK>an ugly road trip to florida  knicks photoshops  anthony davis trade deadline drama and locker room dispersion about fun distracted from a positive     stretch before the all star break  legitimate concern emerged from two blown    point lead against the lakers and clipper  but those issue rest a far cry from a     west coast swing where the c s needed a double digit comeback to top the phoenix sun  <BRK>smart  the lone link between this and the isaiah thomas team whose highlight are quick to earn a retweet from nostalgic c s fan  contrasted a loss to the trailblazer to team he played on in the past  <BRK> we re no longer the hunter  we re the hunted now   he said <BRK>in the early  we ll get it together  phase  smart identified that a slow start can become a slow season  his locker room musing on the team s struggle became gospel  alongside the similarly vocal kyrie irving and newly inserted marcus morris  the celt ripped off eight straight victory and won   of   game  <BRK>smart shot     percent from three on     attempt per game over that stretch  he dished over four asist per game a a secondary ball handler alongside irving  a the celtic rose to a  rd ranked  behind buck and warrior       net rating  from      through     smart posted a      rating in   minute per game  he s currently  th in espn s real plus minus         surrounded by player earning nearly double his salary like chris paul        paul millsap        marc gaol       and blake griffin        <BRK>the fact that smart s overall production compare to some of the league s highest paid player proved something to those against re signing him  at   year old  he ultimately had potential to grow beyond the player he wa a year ago  his real plus minus in      despite consistently posting  plus  performance  ranked  nd at       below   year old pau gasol  <BRK>    percent marked smart s highest career field goal percentage  his three point percentage is     percent above last year  thus a     percent increase in efg    he s taking nearly three fewer shot per game and is two percentage point shy of   percent at the free throw line  <BRK>his     offensive box plus minus is the first positive mark of his career  and pair with a     defensive box plus minus in line with his career average  with smart on the floor this season  the celt average   point per   possession  that s   point higher than any previous year in his career  <BRK>more succinctly  smart became a measurably better basketball player this year alongside his vocal leadership  his shot vastly improved  he s making a career high percentage       of his attempt at the rim and his steal and block percentage are career high  <BRK>paying extra for a player s second contract in anticipation of them growing through the length of the deal became more common this decade with expanded cap flexibility  danny ainge himself signed avery bradley above market value and traded bradley for marcus morris  who ha gone through a career renaissance of his own in boston  not even team kicking around extra cap space seriously considered smart expanding beyond the player he wa in a larger role <BRK>it s easy to imagine an executive currently watching smart s growth kicking himself that their team didn t pursue him  for the celtic  it s hard to imagine the team recovering from their early hole without his leadership and contribution  <BRK>with irving  they ve developed one of the more versatile two way back court in the nba  once viewed a possible contract filler  smart now figure to be deemed a valuable  necessary piece in any trade because of his realized upside  <BRK>for now  signed for the foreseeable future  there s the chance smart continues to progress and lead going forward a a career celtic  <BRK>not sure i say this enough  but damn i love boston    pic twitter com zgjsqyuex <BRK>
