child  but she had a different focus when she competed in rio <BRK> my whole drive  in    wa to win a gold medal  and break that world record  this wa so much more about  let s set up a workout schedule that i loved  let s focus more on being a mom  and trying to figure all that out   vollmer say   i wanted to make rio  i wanted to get a medal  so that drove me in practice  but it wan t a big enough goal to sacrifice other part of my life at that point  <BRK>she had to wait six week after giving birth before getting back in the pool to ensure she had properly healed  davis had to wait a similar amount of time  <BRK> it wa probably about two month after  not full time  working up to it  i started off slow   davis say   it took me a while to get back to jiu jitsu  after all the organ shift around  it wan t a comfortable for me  but it wa about two month or so later that i got into it  <BRK>one of the hardest part of pregnancy for her wa that fight continued to happen in the ufc without her  while the ufc kept it promise she would have a job when she returned  she felt like she wa missing out a she watched her opponent compete    <BRK> i wanted to fight while i wa pregnant  watching other female in your division  you re like  oh  i can t wait to get back   davis say   <BRK>by the time her first son wa born  amy rodriguez had been with the u s  woman s national soccer team for five year  and had won two olympic gold medal  hard work wan t a foreign concept to her  but coming back from having kid required a different level of hard work  <BRK> nobody really explained to me how hard it wa going to be  it wan t like i bounced back immediately  it took a ton of hard work  i trained harder than i ever had   rodriguez say   you re starting from ground zero  you ve had so many month off  your body is changing such an incredible amount  it wa really hard  and i guess i wa surprised at how hard it wa  <BRK>gwen jorgensen won gold at the rio olympics in the triathlon  dominating the world triathlon series in the year leading up to the   olympics  she ran up to   mile a week during her pregnancy a she considered switching to competing in marathon  she often shared picture and motivation for other mom to be on social medium  <BRK> i got pregnant  and i had nine month to ponder what i want to do   jorgensen say   i wa thinking of triathlon  and the only reason i wanted to stay in triathlon wa because i thought i could make more money  that  i thought  wa a very bad reason to stay in a professional sport  <BRK>after childbirth  each of the woman found they had to get to know their body again in a different way  jorgensen ha worked with a pelvic floor specialist  for vollmer  figuring out how to swim at a high level after having her son wa a challenge she

of swimmer are locked up in their upper back  just from the amount of yardage people ask themselves to do  kind of this idea of swimming in a plank  maybe pregnancy started loosening thing up  and i started moving better  <BRK>many ufc fighter walk around at heavier weight than their fighting weight  then cut down the week of their bout  normally this process is agonizing <BRK> my first weight cut afterwards wa probably my eaiest weight cut   davis say   it could almost be because i didn t have a much muscle a i did before   <BRK>no parent of a newborn get enough sleep  but sleep isn t something elite athlete can sacrifice  according to the journal fatigue science  sleep deprivation hamper reaction time  recovery  and decision making ability  athlete who are mother have to be

d nurse him  he d take him back  try to get him to sleep or try to get him away from me so i can get a four hour chunk of sleep  <BRK> i never thought i d claim four hour is a lot  but it wa a lot   <BRK> i think the biggest thing is you re tired when you re a mom  it s always go  go  go  i use a little bit of time to train for me  and then the rest of the day is about them   rodriguez say   i feel like so much of my life is putting them first  and sacrificing my energy  which i desperately need  it all go into them  <BRK>every woman interviewed received nothing but support and love from

new york for an event  i shared with my teammate about eight week later  when we were at the espys  i didn t know how to announce it  so monique ended up just telling everyone  <BRK> when it come to

we re fortunate   davis say   your gym sometimes becomes like your second family  it wa definitely a huge help with everybody trying to pitch in a they could   <BRK>vollmer train at her alma mater  uc berkeley  her coach told her to come back  regardless of what shape she wa in  and they would figure out what her next step would be  <BRK> i walked in  i had the nanny  the stroller  the nursing pillow  my huge diaper bag  i m sitting in the locker room nursing when the new freshman walk into the locker room   vollmer say   everyone kind of chuckle  and we were like   welcome to college   didn t expect a mom sitting here nursing her child    <BRK>perhaps the biggest change every woman experienced since having child  their relationship to sport  <BRK> if i feel like i have some sort of injury ready to pop up  or if i had a bad workout  i never think about it  i never talk about it  something in triathlon that patrick and i strived to do wa to come home and not talk about triathlon   jorgensen say   with stanley  it s so much eaier to come home and have that separation  it s about how can i get a much quality time with stanley a i can  <BRK> it ha taken the stress off a lot more  and in life  just in general  because i m like  you know what  i have bigger thing i have to deal with   davis say   i have a son  i have thing i have to take care of than worry about what somebody on social medium is saying about me  it doesn t affect me the same way  it s a lot easier to brush thing off  <BRK>not every return to competition went perfectly  davis lost her first bout after having her son  she wa submitted by sara mcmann  another mom  jorgensen ran the chicago marathon in early october  and finished in  th place  fifth among american woman  rodriguez had worked to come back from her second son s birth  and then tore her acl and wa out for another   month  <BRK> there are day i felt like super mom  and then there were day i would be in tear wondering how on earth am i trying to do this   vollmer say  <BRK>but davis won her next two fight  rodriguez is back with the uswnt  which qualified for the   world cup in october  plenty of woman have won gold medal a mother

trial to make the team  the lamoureuxs won gold in pyeongchang  and they want to repeat that feat in    they are part of a new breed of working mother who are proving they can juggle the many different responsibility of being a pro athlete and a mom  <BRK>when vollmer returned to swimming  she found she had new fan  mom who were inspired by what she wa doing  and girl who saw her and realized they don t have to make a choice  <BRK> there s been some younger girl  like   year old little kid  that have said that wa their favorite thing  that i wa a mom and i wa still swimming   vollmer say   it make them feel like they can be a mom  too  it s so precious  i feel like we re finally breaking that barrier  it doesn t have to be one or the other   <BRK>rodriguez said many of her teammate are still waiting to have kid until their career are over  she ha been able to do both because of her support system  the balancing act is not easy  <BRK> i hope that we re making it seem tangible  but i don t want to give people the false sense of it s awesome  and it s all positive  because this is actually very  very hard  i ve been so fortunate that i ve gotten to do both  <BRK>
