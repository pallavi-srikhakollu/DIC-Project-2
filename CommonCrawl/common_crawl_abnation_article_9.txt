rob gronkowski called it a career sunday  and now the patriot are in trouble  <BRK> losing gronkowski is the biggest blow   s dealt to an already weak new england receiving corp  only three wide receiver or tight end who caught a pas last fall are set to return for the upcoming season   julian edelman  phillip dorsett  and little used tight end jacob hollister  without gronk on board to give tom brady gaping window to throw the ball downfield  all three will see more defensive attention than ever  <BRK> replacing him won t be easy  or maybe even possible  even in a diminished state he remained a singular force who could take over game like no other player could  <BRK> gronk s last   season averaged       ypa     success rate    passer rtg those rank             best in the nfl for any player with at least   target the last   year     ypa on  rd down target  best in nfl  mismatch nightmare  absolute stud gone far too soon  <BRK> that leaf head coach bill belichick with an unenviable task  new england ha already been proactive on the free agent market in an extremely new england way  the patriot re signed useful wideout dorsett      percent catch rate    yard per reception with brady  to a one year deal  they also added matt lacosse  bruce ellington  and maurice harris to the lineup  the four of them combined for   catch last season  so a couple of them are either going to have to make an unexpected leap or brady is going to need some more help  <BRK> unfortunately  this year s thin free agent receiving corp ha been picked over  adam humphries wa a top target  but new england s hesitance in contract talk allowed him to sign with the titan instead  golden tate is a giant  jared cook  the best available veteran tight end  flirted with the patriot before signing with the saint for more money  <BRK> so who is left to fill some of the biggest shoe in the league  there are three avenue the pat can take   and they ll need help at both tight and and wide receiver to do so  <BRK> by most account  including sb nation s own dan kadar  fant and hockenson will be the first two tight end off the board  it s easy to see why  the hawkeye duo combined upper tier blocking  elite athleticism  especially in fant s case   and proven production in the passing game  they finished first and second in receiving yard for iowa in    combining for   catch      receiving yard  and   touchdown   <BRK> they also come from a program belichick ha skimmed from in the past  his relationship with hawkeyes head coach kirk ferentz ha helped push graduate like cole croston  riley mccarron  and ferentz s son james to the new england roster in recent year  <BRK> the patriot  problem this spring may be that both they and iowa s tight end were too good this past season  neither player is expected to last until new england s selection at no    in the first round  the pat can change all that by dipping into a vast resource of asset   they have   pick in april  more than any other team  including six of the top     and trading up if they re truly sold on fant or hockenson  if either one slide to the end of the first round  it seems a safe bet they ll be on their way to foxborough  the two hawkeyes are the top two most popular mock draft pick for new england this year  <BRK> the crimson tide product come from another pipeline to which belichick ha long turned   though it s not a though picking a player from nick saban s asembly line in tuscaloosa is an especially rare or special thing  smith is following o j  howard s lead into the nfl a an uber athletic alabama tight end with first round apirations  with a     second   yard dah time and upper level performance on the bench and in the   yard shuttle at the nfl combine  he s got the power and athleticism to shine at the next level  <BRK> but smith is no sure thing  he s only got one seaon a a full time starter under his belt in college  and while he put up solid number    catch    yard    tds   that may have been a function of a tua tagovailoa aerial attack that made every member of the bama offense look immortal at time   <BRK> still  he s got nfl bloodline  his dad played tight end for the saint and wa seemingly inserted into every pack of upper deck card i bought from   to    and is interested in a move to the northeast  <BRK>  http   t co tbeiutm nl <BRK> but he could also be gone by pick     kadar s latest mock draft ha him getting snapped him by the target needy packer at no     if that s the case  day   candidate like texas a m s jace sternberger or stanford s kaden smith could be in play  <BRK> mclaurin and campbell have each seen their stock rise in the pre draft process  turning in eye catching workout number after excellent   season with the buckeye  campbell led the team with   catch for     yard and   touchdown before showing out with a     second   time at the combine  tied for the top mark among receiver  and pulling off top five showing in the long and broad jump   <BRK> mclaurin averaged an absurd   yard per catch a a senior and turned head both at the senior bowl and in his pro day workout  he s gone from a potential late round steal to possible early day   pick   and the patriot have six selection to work with those day   <BRK> other early wideout pick who could be in play with new england s first two selection of this year s draft include riley ridley  n keal harry  deebo samuel  and a j  brown  but if belichick spurns the opportunity to make a day   wideout his waterloo once more  there are a few other le hyped prospect who could fit his need  <BRK> scrappy undersized wideouts who were lightly regarded a recruit and still face major question a they transition to the nfl despite prolific college football career  that would never work in new england  <BRK> if the patriot are looking for wideout prospect deeper in the the draft  they ll have their choice of extremely patriot looking player  isabella showed off his burner bonafides with a       at the combine  and waiting long into day   could mean waiting too long on a player who wa prolific at uma   he had   catch and     yard lat seaon  renfrow wan t a impressive  but his history of showing up in big game mean his name ha been circled in belichick s day planner since january     <BRK> also up for inclusion here is west virginia touchdown machine david sill v  who would be the latest quarterback turned wideout to join the patriot  receiving corp  <BRK> here s the toughest part to predict  belichick s lack of success drafting a wide receiver ha been balanced out by his ability to add impact target in various different swap  randy moss  wes welker  and brandin cook all came to new england via trade  <BRK> gronkowski s retirement open up the cap space to add an impact veteran this offseason  if belichick decides to pull the trigger  here are some name who could be logical fit  <BRK> sanu ha long been one of the best supporting cast wide receiver in the nfl   a player who provides a valuable second option  occasional deep threat  and reliable hand on third down  he s also set to cost the falcon      million this fall  which could be an untenable number for a team with only an estimated      million of cap space in    trading away sanu  whose value is mitigated by the presence of julio jones and calvin ridley atop the atlanta depth chart  would create both immediate and long term saving thanks to the rookie contract of the player eventually drafted by the falcon with whichever pick the pat send south  <BRK> the move would give brady another reliable veteran wideout atop his receiving depth chart and belichick another rutgers product he so value  the edelman sanu combination might give new england the league s top pair of pas throwing wideouts  too  <BRK> it wa only two year ago the draft world wa in love with ross  whose record setting     second   yard dah prompted cincinnati to ignore concern about his college production and consistency and make him the no    pick of the   nfl draft  in two year a a pro he s caught just   percent of his target  making   reception on   pases thrown his way and generally serving a an idle deep threat in southwestern ohio  <BRK> that lack of impact ha reportedly put him on the trading block in cincinnati  but he could regain his value playing in a more stable passing environment with the patriot  his ability to stretch the field could create space for edelman and whomever else wind up on the wr te depth chart on intermediate route  similar to how josh gordon s presence softened up defense even when he wasn t a target  of course  ross will have to prove himself repeatedly just to earn a whiff of the respect even an inconsistent gordon got in    but it s not a massive stretch to see how he could fit in the new england offense  <BRK> like sanu  agholor is an expensive player on a team strapped for cap space  the fifth year option on his rookie contract is set to pay him more than    million in    unlike sanu  agholor ha yet to be a consistent receiving threat   though his   breakout prevented him from becoming a first round bust  he s recorded   catch      yard  and   touchdown over the pat two seaon to emerge a a versatile deep threat  <BRK> the eagle have shed enough salary to afford agholor s expensive fifth year  but keeping him is no longer a top priority after the trade that reunited desean jackson and the city of brotherly love earlier this offseason  philadelphia could ship him off in   rather than let him leave with no return other than a potential compensatory   draft pick next winter  it s not like these two team are opposed to doing business  either   general manager howie roseman already took new england s fifth round pick in the michael bennett trade earlier this year  <BRK> tampa bay signed brate to a six year       million contract extension lat march   a kinda strange twist after drafting alabama tight end howard le than a year earlier  while the bucs  plan may have been to play the two together a dual threat like new england had with gronkowski and aaron hernandez  brate ha mostly been shunted to a supporting role  he had just   catch and   yard   although with six touchdown   while making only two start in    <BRK> new head coach bruce arians may have more involved plan for brate  or he may want a fresh start and some extra cap space currently tied up over the final five year and      million on the harvard product s deal  brate isn t a gronkowski replacement up the seam  but he s a valuable red zone target with   touchdown over the past three season   nearly   percent of his catch  the buccaneer backup fill a need in new england  the question is whether arians is interested in parting with him  <BRK> the patriot have roughly    million left to spend this spring  but few big name target available to spend that money on  the tight end market is relatively barren  with decent  unexciting piece  dion sims  lance kendricks   former second round pick who never lived up to the hype  austin seferian jenkins  maxx williams   and guy who were once patriot  matt lengel  a j  derby  shrugging their way across a shallow pool of talent  <BRK> from the top   free agent  to mock draft  to scouting report  we ve got everything you need to get through the offseason  all in one place  <BRK> there are a few more interesting name at wideout  though new england s recent effort to bring le wanted veteran help backfired horribly when eric decker  jordan matthew  and kenny britt were all released before the   season began  the team s effort to bring young reclamation project into the fold didn t pan out either  with corey coleman and amara darboh each earning their release before playing a single game with the team  <BRK> that make it easy to understand why belichick would be reticent to dive into a receiver market filled with well known but flawed name  demaryius thomas  level of play dropped significantly in   before he tore his achilles  pierre garcon will be   this year and missed   total game over the last two season  ryan grant had the opportunity to play with andrew luck and allow t y  hilton to relieve some of the defensive pressure he faced  but he failed to match his solid   campaign in washington  <BRK> jermaine kearse is coming off his worst non rookie seaon a a pro  jordy nelson finished   on a high note    catch    yard in his final five game   but is also going to be   in    kelvin benjamin ha the strongest combination of talent and youth of anyone on this list  he s also seems like the kind of guy belichick would cut after two practice  <BRK>  bill josh allen just asked kelvin benjamin if he wanted to work on route pregame during warm ups   kelvin s answer  no <BRK> bringing back chris hogan would help  though he s still trying to find a way to recapture his deep threat magic from   and wa rendered entirely anonymous in multiple game last fall  other familiar face like brandon lafell and michael floyd could also wind up back on the team s list  no matter who the club pick at this stage  it appears diving into free agency is the least exciting option for the patriot  <BRK> losing gronkowski doesn t just leave a hole in new england s tight end depth chart  it force the patriot to replace the guy who created looser coverage for the rest of his teammate downfield and find a new security blanket for brady when he need to pull a game changing clutch play out of his hat  <BRK> while versatile player like james white and rex burkhead can take on some of the burden in the passing game and sony michel look like the team s most potent lead runner since corey dillon  there s plenty of work still to be done   even if gordon is cleared for a return to the field  <BRK> there s no one solution to this problem  in    the patriot have three avenue to begin chipping away at the biggest possible non belichick  non brady loss on the roster  even if they choose correctly  we may not know until     or later  <BRK>
