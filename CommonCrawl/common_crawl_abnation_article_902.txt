we re reached the official midpoint of the nba regular season  and the denver nugget are in first place in the western conference with a     record  that d put them on pace to go      tied for the team s best mark since the aba merger in the  s  <BRK>for a team that hasn t been to the playoff in six season and hasn t won a playoff series in a decade  this is a meteoric rise up the ladder  it s the kind of rise that totally scramble expectation and reasonable judgment <BRK>expectation are completely theoretical  yet incredibly essential in sport  coach get fired over expectation  coach get new contract over expectation  team that fall short of expectation are dismantled  team that exceed them are reinforced  executive constantly play the expectation game and then watch their career dangle at the mercy of whether those manufactured expectation were met <BRK>how do you set reasonable expectation when a team leap from outside the playoff to the top of a really good conference in one year without a singular talent upgrade  how do the nugget measure success or failure now <BRK>for starter  is this seaon already a success a long a denver doe make the playoff  the nugget were good enough for the postseaon lat year with   win  but the west wa too deep  is actually getting in an accomplishment through that prism  doe the     heartbreak of being one game short lower the threshold for success in     <BRK>this is relevant because in the traditional expectation ladder for rising nba team  a franchise that simply made the postseason in one year would be expected to win a playoff series the following year  to fall short would mean facing call for a big trade or a coaching switch  ask the blazer how all that go <BRK>the nugget didn t technically make the playoff lat seaon  but they might a well have  they had the  th best point differential in the league and only missed out because they played in the west <BRK>viewed from that prism  simply getting into the playoff this season might not quite be enough  the nugget  win progression since     read like this    win    win    win    win  and   something win this season  on that sequence  are we at the  make the playoff  stage of the expectation game  or the  win a playoff series  stage <BRK>this become more complicated because the nugget will likely be a top   seed  top   seed that lose in the first round draw special scorn  no matter their regular season record  again  ask the blazer how all that go  <BRK>this will be felt especially acutely should denver actually claim the no    or   seed  can you reaonably identify a playoff bid a success when you finish the regular seaon a the top or second best team in the conference  doesn t that success inherently force new near term apirations upon you  <BRK>can a no    seed ever just be happy to be in the playoff  probably not  <BRK>mere satisfaction isn t a popular concept in high level sport  if the nugget make it to the playoff for the first time since   but flame out in the first round  it s hard to imagine any but the most sympathetic observer calling the season a success  no matter how much fun this nikola jokic led run ha been <BRK>more nuance could enter the equation should denver win in the first round but experience ejection at the hand of the warrior  rocket  thunder  lakers  or really anyone in the second round  even though the nugget have a better record right now  most neutral party would pick golden state or houston over denver in a best of seven series  oklahoma city didn t have a successful postseason last year  but thing seem to be better now  the lakers fall under the lebron james rule  all expectation are void on either side because he s freaking lebron  <BRK>losing in the first round can be embarrassing   ask the blazer   losing in the second round is  in a way  noble  the nugget could lose in the second round and feel really good about the future <BRK>

  <BRK>that lead to a series of follow up question  is targeting what seems reasonable from an outside perspective a fair way to determine internal expectation  is that fair to the nugget or other team of whom a little more is perhaps expected that they are judged by parameter they didn t set themselves   the raptor and celtic are case study here  toronto ha never made the nba final and this iteration of boston han t been there  but anything le would be a failure   <BRK>if the answer is yes  that lead to more question  if denver is  expected  to win a playoff series in it first postseason in six year  can the nugget front office withstand pressure to mix thing up if the team fall short  on the other hand  if the nugget meet these seemingly reasonable expectation  will expectation then be reset a mile higher for next season  <BRK>then again  given that the nugget front office and ownership suite seems stable and reasonable  doe any of this really matter  maybe the best approach is to enjoy nikola jokic and not fret <BRK>
