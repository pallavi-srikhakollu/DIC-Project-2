  <BRK>if pippen started the conversation  williamson s busted shoe and sprained knee took it to a whole new level this week <BRK>maybe it because the cheap ticket for duke v  north carolina were going for       maybe it s because former president barack obama wa sitting courtside  because it happened just   second into the game between college basketball s premier rival and on a night the nba took off  you couldn t turn on the tv the next day without everyone giving an opinion on whether williamson wa best off shutting it down for the rest of the year ahead of the nba draft <BRK>keep in mind this entire debate unfolded before we knew the severity of williamson s injury  on thursday  duke announced williamson had a grade   knee sprain and would be day to day  in a way  the ambiguity of his status even after the diagnosis mean this debate should only get more intense <BRK>should williamson play again this season for duke  should williamson shut it down now to ensure his health for the draft  there s a simply answer to all of this  the debate begin and end with something like this <BRK>williamson is a lock to be the first pick in the draft come june  that made pippen s original argument an easy one  williamson couldn t improve his stock and shouldn t risk injury ahead of the draft  he also didn t owe duke anything when all he wa getting in return wa a scholarship while everyone else involved in college basketball wa getting rich off of him  <BRK>when williamson went down clutching his knee against unc  it felt like the entire world made this point  utah jazz star donovan mitchell chimed in early <BRK>again let s remember all the money that went into this game     and these player get none of it     and now zion get hurt    something ha to change  ncaa<BRK>so did last year s freshman phenom in college basketball  now nba rookie trae young <BRK>zion need to chill out the rest of season   <BRK>we need change   ncaa<BRK>it wan t just nba player making this point   it wa pretty much everyone  <BRK>you know how the old saying go  a meme is worth     word <BRK>tough one  pic twitter com  xi yi pxx<BRK>so good  <BRK>yes  the ncaa doe not fairly compensate athlete  this is widely accepted at this point  a lot of people have been making money off williamson since he rose to notoriety  from the mixtape maker that followed him religiously in high school  to the tv network that use him to drive up rating  to duke selling out stadium and selling even more merchandise  <BRK>college sport are a con in plain sight  williamson wa very aware of this when he decided to go to duke <BRK>will williamson play again for duke this season if he s healthy enough to do so  well  he wa already asked this in the fallout from the conversation pippen started back in january <BRK> i can t just stop playing   williamson said   i d be letting my teammate down  i d be letting coach k down  i d be letting a lot of people down  if i wanted to sit out  i wouldn t have went to college  i came to duke to play  <BRK>shutting it down would be a business decision for williamson  at   year old  he s currently in the last stretch of his life where he s not a businessman  that will come when duke s season end and he becomes a professional  for now  he s just a basketball player  and there s something kind of beautiful about that even if the money changing hand because of his star power is downright disgusting <BRK>williamson wa wearing paul george s signature nike shoe when he got hurt  george wa asked if williamson should sit out even if he s healthy enough to play and immediately shut down the question <BRK> because he got hurt  that s part of the game   george said   injury are part of the game  that s getting a little too much into business stuff  he went to college to play basketball  to win a championship ultimately  to get injured one time  if he want to shut it down   injury are part of the game  <BRK>james also noted that he wa impressed by williamson s commitment to duke a week before the injury v  north carolina <BRK> i can relate in a sense of he s been covered since he wa in high school and everybody is trying to compare him to the next this or the next that  but the best thing i ve noticed is he seems like a good kid  he seems like he s got his head on straight   james said   and when they asked him about  you know  guy in our league and people who cover our league talking about   if i wa zion williamson  i would sit out for the rest of the year   he wa like   that s  silly   why  i m here to play basketball  i love to play basketball  i m here at duke  i m having fun  these are my friend  i m having a great time  why would i sit out  <BRK> that s the type of s    that strike me  everybody get so caught up in the game itself  i look at the intangible  and he seems like he ha great intangible and seems like a great kid   <BRK>remember what williamson said   i came to duke to play  <BRK>a long a this isn t a seaon ending injury  it would be a surprise if he shut it down  even if that s the smart business move <BRK>if williamson isn t   percent healthy and doesn t feel comfortable returning to duke because of it  he is totally within his right to shut it down ahead of the nba draft  he deserves unanimous support should this happen <BRK>if williamson decides he want to try to win a national championship playing with his friend  he should get   percent support on that decision  too <BRK>williamson can t turn on the tv right now without seeing people he grew up idolizing debate his future on a   hour news cycle  his injury doesn t just feel like the biggest story in college hoop  it feel like the biggest story in all of sport  through all of the medium coverage  he s maintained a level of humility and gratitude most people regardless of field or fame could never reach  <BRK>a year ago  williamson wa thinking about prom  now he s enjoying his one and only year of college  a year from now  his life will be about business a much a it s about baketball  he ll be rich  but he also might not be having a much fun  you know what they say about college  it s the best nine month of your life <BRK>everyone ha an opinion on what williamson should do  but there s only one person whose take on this matter  that s williamson  the debate end like this  williamson should do whatever he want to do  and not regret it for a second <BRK>
