we here at sb nation realize that  the bachelor  is very much sport  therefore  each week we ll recap all the heartbreak  drama  and excitement <BRK>welcome to a new week of thrilling bachelor action a colton attempt to further whittle down his pool of lady suitor to find his future fellow instagram sponsored item hawker wife  this week  there were two group date  and a solo date before a pool party at the mansion  <BRK>if you missed last week  be sure to check out the action here  <BRK>the first group date took eight of our plucky suitor   katie  heather  hannah b   courtney  kirpa  tracy  demi  and caelynn   to a pirate themed medieval time  pitting the woman against one another with the hope of winning the heart of  captain colton  <BRK> this is the story of captain colton  in search of the greatest treasure life had ever seen  love   <BRK> pause for dry heave  <BRK>i have to applaud colton for seeming to actually enjoy these utterly ridiculous group date  he s a good sport and continues to show   can it be   actual personality  it wa a relatively benign group date  but we did get to see the woman partake in the  american gladiator  staple of knocking each other around with oversized giant q tip  <BRK>i m sure it wa completely coincidental that the producer put the woman with the ongoing beef  tracy demi and hannah b  caelynn  on the same outing  completely coincidental  <BRK>colton selected the lovely elyse for a one on one date that featured a helicopter ride to an amusement park where the duo entertained a horde of adorable child for the day  we got our first super awkward concert where the couple dance in front of a crowd of screaming stranger with phone while an up and coming singer serenade everyone  a  bachelor  staple  <BRK>on the second group date  tayshia  nina  cassie  dj agro  sydney  onyeka  caitlin  heather  and nicole all competed for the title of  bachelor strongest woman   after participating in a sled push  featuring a  wedding cake  made of weight   a tire flip dubbed the  ring toss   and a limo pull  no  really  they tried to pull a limo   onyeka beat out sydney and dj agro for the coveted trophy  can t wait for her to tell that story to her grandkids one day  <BRK>we didn t get a cocktail party this week  but a pool party instead  it wa mostly monopolized by more of the pageant beef  but this also happened  <BRK>only hannah g  didn t get a date this week  but colton say it s because he s so sure about their relationship that he didn t need one  talk about a nice week on  the bachelor   you spend a few day by the pool  you don t have to stress about competing with the other woman  and get your name called right out of the gate  not bad  hannah g  i can t wait  til you re the only hannah so i don t have to use last name letter  <BRK>let s get to the highlight  <BRK>tracy and caelynn won the arbitrary finalist selection from the professional performance pirate  hannah b  wa robbed   she crushed at the q tip fighting   and the duo had to zip line to the deck and big q tip fight  but none of that matter  i literally don t even remember who won  <BRK>i only want to talk about one thing  <BRK>did demi throw her turkey leg  <BRK>did i spend   minute photoshopping that picture  yes  do i regret that  also yes  <BRK>why would demi waste such a perfectly good turkey leg  why did no one seem to react to it   at all  this is the biggest mystery of the season  hand down  <BRK>we get it  demi  you think anyone over   is old  demi spent all of her airtime insulting the other woman  blindfolding and spanking colton  feeling him up with a mannequin hand  and being just overall exhausting  i thought it would take dj agro being sent home for demi to emerge a the one the woman hate in the house  but here we are in week   and demi ha been pulled aide by another woman for a chat about her behavior in every episode so far  <BRK>i think that ha to be a new record  <BRK>hannah b  spilled some of the tea on her pageant beef with caelynn  committing the fatal bachelor move of spending alone time talking about another competitor  hannah  who is miss alabama  think that the caelynn she know from the miss usa competition isn t the one they re seeing in this setting  and the whole thing make her super befumbled  <BRK>i m assuming this is something combined with befuddled or bewildered  but what is the  umbled part  just fumbled  did she think that the word wa befumbled and not befuddled  either way  i m for the use of the word  <BRK>one thing i m not befumbled about  these two are on a crash course for a pageant beef   on   and it s going to be miserable for everyone involved  <BRK>speaking of the pageant beef  we got some info  but not a lot  like  really not a lot  hannah b   the befumbled one  brought up the pageant beef on the group date  but didn t use any exact information  regardless  it backfired  shocker  on the tattletale a colton used his group date rose to comfort the now cry caelynn  all of the information we got wa very vague and along the line of  he s being lied to  and  this isn t the person i know from pageant   <BRK>the ceaseless discussion continued into the pool party at the mansion in the afternoon and everything wa described in wide open term like  toxic    manipulative   and  deceitful   without either one of them showing any real receipt  it s the worst beef because one just call the other a generic insult  and the other responds with  i m not deceitful   <BRK>nothing say trustworthy like this exchange  <BRK>hannah  just freakin  trust me  i m telling the truth <BRK>colton  i need a minute  <BRK>give u the detail  there ha to be more  did someone put nair in someone else s shampoo  <BRK>at least we got the phrase  tank of rage  from hannah  <BRK>helicopter freak me out  and that s something i have to deal with personally  but this just look super uncomfortable  <BRK>the workout group date wa pretty terrible overall  but the appearance of terry crew and his wife rebecca made everything a little more tenable  look  i love to work out  i love to run  know when i do not want to do that  in front of a bunch of other woman competing for the same dude  while that dude is there  like  do none of these lady sweat  what is that  how doe your hair stay like that  <BRK>anyway  here s terry crew  nine nine  <BRK> we walk in and it wa terry and rebecca crew  and i wa  like  freaking out   white chick  is one of my favorite movie   <BRK>mhmmm  ok  sure  <BRK> colton s not a stretching virgin anymore  <BRK>this is my weekly cassie appreciation section  our girl finally got some time with colton  and they unsurprisingly have great chemistry  i heart you  cassie  <BRK>ble her heart  thing did not go great for sweet caitlin in her time on  the bachelor   first  her yellow team lost in the billy eichner hosted camp game  meaning she got le time with colton  this week  she tried to make up for it  but thing were rough  <BRK>this actually happened  <BRK>colton  what are you looking for right now  caitlin  someone to go out with me and my friend  colton   blank stare  thebachelor<BRK>at    you can hardly blame caitlin for wanting to keep thing light  you are  however  on a show that is supposed to end with an engagement  if you re just looking for someone to party with in toronto  this might not be the place for you  <BRK>caitlin thought thing were going great right up until the moment colton told her it wan t working and deposited her on the curb for the black suv ride of shame  poor thing wa shocked  farewell  sweet caitlin  <BRK> the two best pirate are going to compete for colton s heart  and it s perfect for me because i m a cutthroat kind of chick  the job of a pirate is to steal  and i m here to steal colton s heart
