the moment that treyvon hester  a defensive tackle who started the   season on the philadelphia eagle practice squad  reached up and snagged the edge of the ball bear kicker cody parkey had just sent towards the upright  sealing his team s playoff win  he became a very particular kind of hero  instantly  hester wa the star of a familiar  irresistible nfl narrative  the underdog player who scrapped his way onto the team and wound up indispensable  <BRK>the nfl player who still haven t had their primetime breakthrough rely on that narrative  too   you hear all those undrafted success story     i mean i wa in seattle  so i had a bunch of example right in front of me   say tyvis powell  an undrafted safety who ha played for five different team in two year since spending his rookie season with the seahawks   i wa like   i m going to be the next one to do that   thing just haven t worked out that way  but the good thing is that i keep getting opportunity  <BRK>the price of taking those opportunity  though  is much steeper than fan might imagine  player at the bottom of the roster and on the practice squad have to be prepared to move across the country at a moment s notice  for reason that may have nothing to do with their own performance  a player in a different position group get hurt  so suddenly adding depth there take priority  <BRK>those move are only partially subsidized by team  cutting into what are already comparatively modest practice squad salary  powell  who moved from the niner to the jet and back again during the   season  estimate in his career he s spent      just on relocating to play   it s unfortunate  but it is a job   he say   i ve come to learn it s better than nothing   <BRK>there were   addition to nfl practice squad after week    when team sign their first   player practice squad  though a number of those transaction account for player moving on and off of the practice squad of the same team  it suggests that the majority of nfl practice squad player had to move at least once mid season   meaning the squad s instability affected a wide swath of nfl player  <BRK>and even if their check look substantial from the outside  if you account for tax and the fact that they re meant to sustain player over the course of the entire offseason  it s clear the money is not enough to support the flexibility the position requires  it s a journeyman lifestyle  but often without the active roster paycheck that make that path worthwhile <BRK>

  <BRK>rees odhiambo  a guard who moved four time during the   season  shared what s become an all too familiar routine  when a team call  you get on a flight  if you ve just been cut from the active roster  that call generally come just after you clear waiver at   p m  on tuesday  there s no time  really  to pack or deal with any of the logistics of moving  you arrive that night  the team pick you up from the airport and hand you a copy of the playbook to start studying  the next morning  you go through a series of physicals  sign your contract  and get on the field <BRK>the team pay for a week in a hotel  during which player are expected to find their own housing   you re in a brand new location  and you ve gotta learn the whole playbook that everyone else ha had for the past few month   say odhiambo   outside of that  you have to cover finding a place to live  getting a car to drive  all the essential  even just getting a ride to the team facility   the team only cover you for the first day and after that you re on your own  you start working at six in the morning and you re back at six at night  and then you eat and study  and after that is the only time you have to find a place to live  that in between time   plus  the place you find need to accommodate the fact that you might have to leave at any time  a lease is a huge liability <BRK>there are a number of solution to this conundrum  most of them with considerable drawback  when powell first joined the niner practice squad in november    he stayed in an embassy suite hotel near the facility that wound up costing him      for a month and a half   it wa the middle of the season and the team wa      so they weren t going to the playoff   he say   so i decided to just do something temporary  i didn t know anybody  in the area  or what else i could do   <BRK>he wa back with the team for training camp in    and elected to rent a furnished one bedroom  powell life with his girlfriend and dog  so getting a roommate wan t really an option   i went fully furnished  because it wa month to month  and being on practice squad it s a  here today  gone tomorrow  type of thing   he say  that set him back      a month  <BRK> it s unbelievable   he say  laughing   that s that california stuff  when you stay in expensive city  the rent is really high so the majority of your money is going to rent  you re not really saving any money  <BRK>when the niner brought him back a a member of the active roster for the lat two week of the seaon  he stayed at richard sherman s house  now  staying with family back in his native ohio  powell can joke about it   i refused to pay any more money   he say  <BRK>for rookie  navigating the logistics is even more challenging  richard  dewey  jarvis  a linebacker who graduated from brown in   and went undrafted  thought he had it made when he wa on the atlanta falcon   man roster after training camp   i saw a big paycheck and a little bit of a future there  so i got a six month lease   which i still have   say the massachusetts native  now home for the offseason  he d also paid to ship his car from new england to atlanta <BRK>but jarvis wa cut the day of the falcon  first game  when a long snapper injury meant the team needed to sign one off the practice squad  having already traveled with the team to philadelphia  he wan t even allowed on the field  jarvis had no choice but to watch the entire game from the locker room   i just never thought it would be like that   he say now  <BRK>he wa on the falcon practice squad for a few more week before being cut from the team altogether  when he wa signed to the jacksonville jaguar practice squad  jarvis took a more cautious approach   i had a different mindset  because i d seen how quickly you can move   he say of his choice to remain in the extended stay hotel where the jaguar had initially put him up   i wa paying a little bit more  but the minimum lease available were for three month  and at that point  i didn t think i wa going to be there for three month   <BRK>when he wa cut from that practice squad after three week and moved to buffalo  jarvis took the same approach  staying in a hotel  but with the added expense of renting a car   he left his car at the apartment he s still paying for in atlanta  even in the inexpensive city of buffalo and jacksonville  staying in a hotel cost him around      a month <BRK> if you look back at it  yes  there were way to save money   say jarvis of the money he s spent trying to accommodate practice squad life s unpredictability   but the problem is that you can t predict the future   on the practice squad  trying to predict the future get you in trouble  some player who enter the league with no money to get settled   after playing on national tv for three or four year without getting paid   take out loan from their agent  it s a strategy that can backfire if they don t do a well in the league a promised <BRK>the pressure to perform when you re on a team s fringe is immense  maybe the medium isn t hounding you the way they do with some of the nfl s star  but you re always a day away from getting cut  moving midseason mean not only learning a new playbook  but ingratiating yourself with a whole new group of player and coach with the hope that they ll keep you around   essentially restarting the process of making it onto an nfl team hard knock style but with a heavy handicap  since the vast majority of the team ha already had much more time to get into a rhythm <BRK>on the most baic level practice squad player do more work during the week a they re expected to take rep on offense and defense  moving around the field to mimic a team s next opponent  but for those who are really pushing to make the team  there s even more work involved   you re trying to prove yourself  get on the coach s good side  and gain the trust of your teammate to try to get off of the practice squad   say jarvis   that entail doing extra thing like staying after practice and getting extra rep  because you re not really the focus during practice  <BRK>in addition  some nfl team task their practice squad with extra workout  powell say that the niner have a special practice squad lift session early in the morning that active roster player aren t obliged to participate in   one of those hardcore  wintertime  back at college lift where you d say to yourself   there s no way you guy are gonna make me lift this and then go to practice today   he say   but somehow  some way  we did  <BRK>according to odhiambo  for offensive player learning the playbook alone can take two week  he s had to learn four different one over the course of the seaon   it s exhausting to have to sit there and cram almost every night   he say    when you ve been with a team for a while   you already know the playbook and you re cramming for the team you re playing against that week  but i had to learn an entire playbook a well a what the team is doing in the next game  so that when i go to practice i know what s going on   <BRK> but you re being assessed from the moment you get there   i say   basically   he reply  laughing   and they don t care  <BRK>powell and jarvis have both also been aked to change position repeatedly a they ve moved from team to team  adding an extra layer of difficulty to making a roster  powell ha been between corner and safety over the entire course of his nfl career   whenever he s gotten comfortable at one of them  he say  he s been aked to switch  or cut and sent to a different team that wanted him to switch  <BRK> it s a gift and a curse   say powell   the versatility is what keep you around  but it s kind of like     i just want to master one thing  but whatever help the money keep coming in  you have to do  <BRK>there are other hidden liability to moving team mid season when you re on the bottom of an nfl roster  despite the fact that cut are so often situational and have little to do with a player s ability or performance  nfl resume are treated like those outside the league  bouncing around too much is a red flag  <BRK> the more you travel from team to team  the more you have kind of a stigma   say odhiambo   team think that either you re injured  or you have something wrong with you mentally  or you re a troublemaker   <BRK>he say coach often ask him question to try to sus out why he s moved so much   they ask about whether you re drinking a lot or partying   he say   it s like being re evaluated from a draft perspective   <BRK>during the draft and after  team also sometimes ask player if they have a wife or girlfriend   any family that might impact a player s ability to move freely from team to team  <BRK> from the outside  it s so simple   you just show up and play football   say jarvis   but on the inside  there s just so many moving part  <BRK>the uncertainty can be disillusioning   the one quote that i ve heard about a million time since i ve been in the league is   you have to control what you can control    say powell   a true a that is  you can do everything you re supposed to do right and sometime the number aren t there  that s been the whole thing with me   it s just a number thing  there s not space on the roster  like  y all need to figure out the number  because it always seems to be me who get cut  <BRK> i thought once i made the team  i would have a lot more stability   say jarvis   but i didn t realize how quickly people are rotated in and out of each team  that wa really eye opening   though he say he truly enjoyed his first season  and wa amazed by the positive energy in all the locker room he s been in  jarvis is thinking about what will make life in the nfl worthwhile going forward   personally i d rather have a home  put some root down   he say   next season i have to ask   what are the chance  how stable is the next gig going to be    <BRK>there are some straightforward solution that might make the unpredictable life of practice squad player more sustainable  one is requiring team to provide housing for practice squad player  or a housing stipend   that s something that i think we re looking into for our union deal   say odhiambo   it s one thing to go to arizona or texa  where it s eay to get housing  but in city like new york  san francisco  or la  guy have an impossible tak a far a finding a place to live within the same week of having to report to work and be focused on this job  <BRK>another option would be expanding the nfl s   man roster  which could reduce turnover and promote player safety by reducing pressure on injured player to stay in the game  compared to college team  who have no limit on the number of active player they can compete with   and who mostly play   game a season  max   nfl roster are stretched remarkably thin  sean payton  sean mcvay  and dan quinn have all spoken this year about increasing the game day active roster  currently at   player   if it were larger  that might have a ripple effect and increase overall roster size <BRK> it might help with the number thing they keep telling me about   say powell   that might save people like me  <BRK>in the meantime  practice squad player will keep grinding   moving where the work is  and trying to get another one of those elusive opportunity  <BRK> i always wonder how it feel to walk in the locker room and not have to worry  to be like  i know i m gonna be here    powell add   but then again  i don t know if anybody ha that feeling in the nfl  it s such a cutthroat business  <BRK>
