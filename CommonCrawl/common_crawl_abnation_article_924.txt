  <BRK>in total    percent of the super bowl starter were four  or five star recruit  to put it another way  about two in every five super bowl starter were four  or five star recruit  but only about one in every   rated recruit get that many star   and hundred of thousand of high school player don t get rated at all  so  yes  your odds of starting in the super bowl are  unsurprisingly  much higher if you were a superstar recruit in high school  <BRK>all ranking via the  sport composite <BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK>
