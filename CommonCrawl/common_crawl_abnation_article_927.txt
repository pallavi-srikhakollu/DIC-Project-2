that point  it wa so early on in the stage of development that it wan t really safe to use  so we couldn t   <BRK>olson wa diagnosed with the cancer when he wa an infant  and at   month old  doctor removed his left eye  twelve year later  they removed his right eye  <BRK>dr  brenda gallie  the head of the retinoblastoma program at toronto s hospital for sick child  ha helped develop a device called the episcleral topotecan  along with olson s physician  dr  linn murphree  in the last year  the device ha successfully cured a   year old with retinoblastoma and saved one of the child s eye  upon hearing that story  olson wa motivated to contribute to the cause <BRK> it wa really something that hit me hard in the sense that obviously if i had it   year ago it would ve changed my life   olson said of learning about the device   but since i m in this position  i m going to use it to the best of my ability to make sure that for the future generation they don t have to go through the same situation i did   <BRK>although olson told espn he wa hoping to make   rep    isn t too shabby  he worked over the winter to raise his number by the middle of march  <BRK> if i were to do a bench press on january    i probably would ve done around     he said  i added about five rep i would say over the next two month  <BRK>a lot of college football fan first learned his name in    when he wa featured on a segment during espn s college gameday  when olson and his family were told that his second eye would have to be removed  olson wanted to see his trojan one last time  trojan head coach pete carroll made it happen <BRK> i m just sad i won t be able to see them ever again   jake said   it s so hard  and yet cancer win  but i m going to experience something no one else can experience  <BRK>with more than a month before his surgery  jake told his parent that what he wanted to see most one last time wa another usc trojan game  his wish reached trojan head coach  pete carroll <BRK> the first thing wa let s make sure that he get inside and get to see everything that he want to see   carroll said   god bless him  he deserves every bit of it  <BRK>carroll then made olson an honorary member of the usc football team  he eventually made his high school team a a long snapper  then walked on at usc in    he had hist first live game action in    thanks in part to an asist from western michigan <BRK>this is anything but a regular pat jake olson  blind since age    just snapped for the first time in a live game  http   t co amyhcfovue<BRK>i asked olson what it wa like to have one of the last thing he doe in his usc football career at pro day be something that might help cure the thing that brought him to the program in the first place  <BRK> i mean  it s crazy  that s what kind of gave me goosebump when i first realized that   olson said   it s humbling  if that s what my purpose really is from this whole experience is that i had to go blind and endure that and push forward  and keep moving  <BRK> and to be in this position where i can return it and change hundred of life in the future  i ll pay that small price every day  it s really cool and an honor that i get to be in a position to make a difference for kid that i can sympathize with who are facing reality  retinoblastoma  and the possibility of losing their sight  <BRK>he s slated to graduate from usc in may   with a degree in business administration  and he ll be active in speaking engagement  like he is now  <BRK>he s even helped develop a booking website for speaker across the country  after finding the system for booking  antiquated   his platform is called engage  <BRK> we tried to democratize the whole system and reinvent the system and make it kind of digital and centralized   he said  <BRK>but don t worry  unlike ja rule  he isn t planning on promoting his booking platform with a music festival  there will be no jake olson organized fyre festival  <BRK> it wa really funny just to see how close they were to hitting this thing out of the park   olson said   and so we re like   alright  well if they didn t  we re just gonna do it ourselves   <BRK>olson s signed with a talent agency in los angeles  where he ha a couple of potential project on the horizon  he said  ranging from book deal to commercial  he plan to play in some golf pro am  too <BRK> i just want to show them through my action more than word that you can live a happy  fulfilling life   olson said   no matter if you do lose your eyesight  if you beat the cancer and you have one eye left or no eye left  if you only have one arm or one leg  i want to be another example of someone who wa faced with an unfair situation  and wan t necessarily dealt the best hand  but i made it work  <BRK>
