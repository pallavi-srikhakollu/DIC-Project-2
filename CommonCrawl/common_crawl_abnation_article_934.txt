mostly anonymous in    others will play key role for contending club  <BRK>here are five player who signed in the first week of free agency who didn t generate headline but should still pay major dividend come december <BRK>new england wa in need of a run stuffing defensive lineman with malcom brown now a saint and occasional healthy scratch danny shelton s future with the team uncertain  the patriot filled that hole by picking up a player with whom they were already familiar   former jet defensive tackle pennel <BRK>mike pennel ha impressive quickness for a   lber  get inside shaq s pad

for carolina s odd year return to a winning record <BRK>there are caveat to williams  performance  however  panther qbs saw their sack rate drop from     percent to     percent with williams sidelined lat fall  cam newton s time to throw did decreae without his budding young left tackle  but only by     second   not enough to make a meaningful difference or any definitive statement about the strength of his pocket  carolina s yard per play average jumped from     to     without it starting right tackle a well   though that s probably more attributable to christian mccaffrey s breakout second seaon than any observable change in blocking up front <BRK>barron wa one of the first hybrid star linebacker to stand out a a pro  giving the buccaneer and then the ram a player who can fulfill

some wild swing in this year s draft  they can either take a shot with an early round linebacker and break him into the position slowly  or use those day   and   pick   including the extra third rounder acquired from the raider in the antonio brown trade   to address other need while relying on it new ilb pickup a a bridge from the present to the future <BRK>barron isn t necessarily an every down player at this point in his career  but he won t have to be in pittsburgh  if he can provide the tight end stymying presence in the middle of the field that help the steelers get off the field on third down  he ll be worth his    million annually <BRK>in a year when big name safety cashed in despite a positional surplus   collins  thomas  tyrann mathieu and lamarcus joyner signed contract

in his first foray into free agency <BRK>he may have landed in a perfect situation  he ll have the chance to step in and replace adrian amos  who  coincidentally  signed with clinton dix s former team in wisconsin  in the bear  secondary  his primary duty won t be sexy   he s pretty much the downfield anchor who allows playmaker eddie jackson to ruin opposing quarterback  sunday  but it s a job clinton dix can handle while providing useful over the top coverage a a safety who can make hay in the box and also roam a little bit downfield  he s got   interception and   tackle over his pat three seaons <BRK>clinton dix isn t perfect  but he served a the thin strand that held together a disintegrating packer  secondary early in his career  he ll join one of the league s best defense in   and have more support than ever before  that could be the license he need to soar in his sixth year a a pro <BRK>nick foles need weapon in jacksonville  last year s jaguar team got an inefficient performance from tailback leonard fournette  t j  yeldon  and carlos hyde and averaged just     yard per carry   good for  th best in the league  only fournette is under contract for    dede westbrook

team s top tight end threat  james o shaughnessy  finished the year with   catch <BRK>help is on the way  <BRK>signing former cowboy tight end geoff swaim should provide a modest boost  but the real centerpiece of the team s offensive reinforcement is conley  the former chief ha caught nearly   percent of his target over the pat three seaon  averaging a shade under   yard per catch  while he s useful across the lineup and can play along the sideline and in the slot  his most important role may be a a red zone target  not only is conley     with an absurd   inch vertical leap  but he s shown plenty of talent when it come to making contested catch through tight window <BRK>chris conley is not without viable skill  his return will help this next season  very strong with contested catch down

lee  and d j  chark for a starring role with the jag   and he s also going from a quarterback who threw the ball more than   time per game last season to one who averaged   pass per start in philly  <BRK>if the jag want foles to keep up that pace  they ve got to surround him with playmaker  they may have found a hidden gem in conley <BRK>
