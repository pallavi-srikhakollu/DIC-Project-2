head coach  jake spavital  first year <BRK>  record and s p  ranking        th <BRK>projected   record and s p  ranking        nd <BRK>five key point <BRK>bill c s annual preview series of every fbs team in college football continues  catch up here <BRK>on it face  it seemed a pretty natural occurrence  after nearly three season  texas state fired it head coach  everett withers  after he went just     in charge  a bad record lead to a firing  rinse and repeat <BRK>with the detail that emerged following withers  dismissal  however  it began to seem like txst wa doing withers a favor by letting him leave town <BRK>here are a few of the more notable report  reporter keff  ciardello ha tweeted recently <BRK>  texas state promised to cover everett withers  buyout from his previous employer  they reneged on that promise  forcing withers to pay a quarter of a million dollar out of pocket       <BRK>  several texas state student athlete have been rampantly misdiagnosed and mistreated by an athletics training staff that is reportedly woefully inept <BRK>  texas state s football coach were forced to pay out of pocket for deli tray to feed their own player after the nutrition budget wa cut with no prior notification       <BRK>  the bobcat  recruiting budget wa suddenly stonewalled with no communication  causing the coach to directly solicit donor for emergency fund       <BRK>  texas state s compliance team erroneously told the coaching staff that they could not blueshirt incoming recruit <BRK>  lastly  when larry teis broke the news of withers  firing to the player  the team verbally accosted him to the point where teis wa forced to be escorted out of the room to avoid an altercation  if message board post are to be believed  supposedly teis could not name a single player in the room when player started challenging him <BRK>yikes <BRK>when we talk about the football potential that certain program have or don t have  we usually think of thing in term of recruiting and geography and whatnot  positioned in san marcos  halfway between san antonio and austin  texas state will forever have a lot of that type of potential  but you still need an administration capable of giving coach what they need to succeed <BRK>it s hard to say with any certainty that withers wa the right guy for the job  the former minnesota and north carolina defensive coordinator and ohio state co coordinator hadn t worked in texas for   year before landing the txst job  and     i mean     he went      his defense made fantastic stride in    and it didn t matter because the offense wa never anything but hopeless <BRK>still  you can t say with certainty that he couldn t have thrived if the administration had done it part  he wa coaching with one hand tied behind his back  would anyone have been able to succeed <BRK>now we get to find out if jake spavital can figure thing out that withers couldn t <BRK>spavital certainly ha more recent experience in the region  he also know how to score point  a   year old former assistant at tulsa  houston  oklahoma state  and texas a m  and  most recently  west virginia   spavital ha been paired with plenty of the world s renowned air raid engineer   kevin sumlin  sonny dyke  dana holgorsen   and landing his first head coaching job in this locale make plenty of sense on paper <BRK>like any first time hc  spavital ha a lot to prove  in this case  so do his superior <BRK>

  <BRK>spavital s offensive coordinator hire wa guaranteed to win the internet s approval  bob stitt wa head coach at colorado school of mine and montana before spending lat seaon a an oklahoma state analyst  stitt ha served a a svengali type of influence for a lot of successful offensive coach  including many who employed spavital   and bringing him aboard doe more than appeae writer like me   it also both strengthens the staff s offensive bona fides and give spav the wise old sage that a lot of first time hcs try to bring to their first staff <BRK>this offense need all the help it can get  in three season under withers  txst ranked  st   th  and  th in off  s p   last year s attack uncovered just enough big play ability to score the most point of the withers era      but it wa too dreadfully inconsistent for that to matter too much  they scored   or more point in a game three time but scored exactly seven four time <BRK>for whatever it s worth  the   txst offense will have experience  sophomore quarterback tyler vitt shared the starting role with willie jones iii last season  both missed time with injury  but vitt ended up with     passing yard and a decent run presence  he wa far more int prone than jones  who ha since transferred to a junior college  but the three star from san antonio appears to have potential <BRK>so doe his receiving corp  at least if you squint  senior hutch white and junior caleb twyford seem to have efficiency capability in the right offense   they combined for a   percent catch rate but just     yard per catch   and junior jeremiah haydel is explosive    yard per catch over two season  if inconsistent    percent catch rate   mason hay ha   catch for   yard over two season  and sophomore javen bank caught   for   last year  too  and among true and redshirt freshman  there are five former three star prospect <BRK>granted  all of these weapon didn t prevent txst from ranking  nd in passing s p  last season  but if you pin some of that on youth at quarterback and a le than clear vision from the coach  you can maybe talk yourself into improvement this season  and if vitt doesn t grasp what stitt is throwing at him  one of two juco transfer  fullerton cc s gresch jensen or independence cc s chase hildreth  might <BRK>one figure texa state might be throwing the ball more in    and that could be a good thing  a the bobcat didn t get much from the running back position lat year  anthony d  taylor  led  the way with   carry but averaged just     yard per carry  and junior robert brown jr  didn t top him by much    carry      per carry   the return of sophomore anthony smith      per carry in    with a   percent success rate that would have led lat year s rb  from an acl tear could help  but no one s proven much here <BRK>the line wa a disaster last year  but you can blame at least part of that on injury and constant shuffling  only one player started all   game  honorable mention all conference center aaron brewer   and texas state became the rarest of the rare  a team that start at least   guy up front  i encounter a small number of them during each preview series  it is not a designation that tends to lead to much success <BRK>in seaon continuity tends to mean a lot for a line  and txst had absolutely none  but all   player who started are scheduled to return  and spavital signed juco lineman eddie riva and big three star freshman dalton cooper  a well  competition could produce a steadier unit  that s how it work in theory  anyway <BRK>a daily ish mini column on the college football thing of the day  with some other stuff too <BRK>in order to maintain the bobcat  defensive progress  spavital went with someone he likely know pretty well  his brother  zac spavital spent most of the lat decade at houston and texa tech  where he spent     a co coordinator of a defense that wan t good  per say   th and  st in def  s p   respectively  but definitely improved  at leat <BRK>txst actually topped tech in def  s p  last season  surging from  th to  rd  despite minimal disruptive presence    st in stuff rate   th in havoc rate   rd in sack rate   the bobcat played smart  reactive ball  they tackled well and ranked fifth in passing marginal efficiency allowed and seventh on standard down  you didn t make many big play on texas state      gain per game of   plus yard   nd in fbs   and they didn t make it incredibly easy to make dink and dunk gain either <BRK>stylistically  this is dramatically different than spavital s tech defense  which wa more active and more willing to sacrifice big play for incompletions and or potential turnover <BRK>spavital inherits one of the most experienced defense in the country  of the   player who recorded at least   tackle  all of them are scheduled to return <BRK>there are key senior at each level of the defense  from end ishmael davis  who led the team with eight tackle for loss and     sack  to corner anthony j  taylor  but the linebacking corp  led by six senior  is the heart of the unit <BRK>ilbs bryan london ii  nikolas daniel  and gavin graham and olbs frankie griffin  clifton lewis jr  and hal vinson give the bobcat depth that few other sun belt team can manage  and they force spavital s hand when it come to maintaining the     system from withers  day  sophomore end jakharious smith is one of the more exciting young defender on the team  too  and at         he s built far more like an olb  or an sec safety  than a de <BRK>the front seven is pretty senior heavy  but the secondary is both strong and younger  sophomore jarron morris could be one of the best corner in the league and pair nicely with both taylor and junior kordell rodgers  the safety corp is loaded  too  with junior josh newman and senior jashon waddy and jalen smith  <BRK>my only concern here is one of style  txst found success playing a certain way last year and held four of it last seven opponent to   or fewer point with it  spavital appears to be a bit more aggressive  and maybe the personnel at hand is experienced enough to grasp and thrive with the change <BRK>or maybe there is more risk taking in    and we find that the good big play prevention personnel isn t nearly a impressive at making play itself <BRK>the next good txst special team unit will be the first in a half decade  under dennis franchione  the bobcat ranked sixth   th  and  th  respectively  in special team s p  from      they have ranked in the triple digit ever since <BRK>the return game appears to be in good hand with hutch white  punt  and jeremiah haydel  kick   but place kicking wa utterly miserable last year  three kicker combined to miss five of   pat  make just   percent of their field goal under   yard  and make   percent beyond    they ranked  th in fg efficiency  and while two of the three kicker were freshman  that s inexcusably bad  and considering how much the bobcat were punting  ranking  th in punt efficiency wa an issue  too  none of this is guaranteed to improve with current personnel <BRK>s p  doesn t take coaching change into account  but based solely on massive level of returning production   third most in the country   the bobcat are projected to improve to  nd overall  that would be their best ranking in five season <BRK>a  th or so ranking in the sun belt tends to get you pretty close to bowl eligibility  and sure enough  s p  project the bobcat a a comfortable favorite in three game and within a touchdown in five more  if the offense improves and the defense either improves or doesn t regress much  this could be a pretty fun seaon in san marcos <BRK>of course  a coaching change tends to throw projection into the air a bit  can spavital maintain the burgeoning defensive culture while overhauling the offense  can he keep thing moving forward in some area while completely changing others  we never really know in advance <BRK>the number tell u there might be something here  history  and texas state administration  remind u not to take that for granted <BRK>all   preview data to date <BRK>
