and it look incredible  mbstadium pic twitter com ufblkay xq <BRK> the roof ha been able to open since the stadium s debut in    and team will have the option to open or close it  weather permitting  before game  for the super bowl  it ll most likely be closed  but it s a sight nonetheless  <BRK> right below the roof is the  halo board   which ha     lineal foot of ribbon board  it tower over the field  providing     square foot of screen  and if you stretched it out  it d be longer than the eiffel tower   <BRK> look  at  that   wow   mbstadium  pic twitter com cgzkxv bdu <BRK> here s where it s controlled  <BRK> there s a  mega column  that s wrapped in an led screen on three side  too  <BRK> it s easy to eat for under     for just    you can get a refillable cup  it s like they re not trying to gouge you at all   <BRK>  when you can come to an nfl stadium or a major league soccer stadium and be able to feed your family  a kid for     and get a hotdog  a refillable soda  a popcorn  and a pretzel  and right there you ve only spent      stadium general manager scott jenkins told sb nation   i don t think there s a sport venue in the country that can say that    <BRK> there are   local atlanta food option along with     beer tap in the stadium  so don t worry about having a lack of variety  speaking of beer  domestic and craft beer are at great price  too  it s all about the stadium s fan first initiative  so don t worry about paying big buck for both your ticket and food and drink at the super bowl   <BRK> yes  there s a chick fil a that ll be closed even during the big game on sunday  but it s open for college football game and other event  besides  i sampled the chicken sandwich at west nine and game changer  and they were absolutely delicious  <BRK> there are also   different  neighborhood bar  in the stadium and other fan first area  and that s not all  <BRK> it ha     mile of optic fiber  powering everything at the speed of light  in addition to free  fast wifi throughout  the building ha over     tv  so fan won t miss a second  <BRK>  we ve got     wireless access point in the building   jenkins said   so there s     of them in the seating bowl and another   in the concourse  so no matter where you are in this building    some thousand fan will have fast  wireless connectivity  and then whether you re on wifi or your on your cell phone with cellular service  we ll have a distributed antenna system that s throughout the building  that ll give you great service through various carrier   <BRK> it     solar panel can generate enough solar energy on it campus in a year to power over nine falcon home game or   united home match  the stadium will also reuse rain water that the stadium collect  <BRK>  we ll use about   percent le water  through our design of the building and our capture and re use of rain water   jenkins said   so the rain water that hit the site  will be stored in a     gallon cistern  and we ll use that water for make up water for our cooling tank and to irrigate the landscaping   <BRK> obviously  this would be a lot cooler if the falcon were playing in the super bowl  but it s pretty dope to see in person  speaking a a current atlanta resident  that s one giant metal bird statue  <BRK> this might be the closest you can possibly get to a major football game a a paying customer  <BRK> here s the sky bridge  which offer a view of downtown atlanta     <BRK>     and just about everywhere are bar style ledge that fan can lean on after wandering around  <BRK> the georgia dome hosted both the   and   super bowl  if you remember either of those  let s just say sunday s super bowl will be on a whole other level in this stadium   <BRK>  every decision we ve made ha been squarely with the fan  perspective of  how do we take the fan experience to the next level    jenkins said   the led display we have  whether it s every seat is two inch wider than the georgia dome  almost all the concourse connect so you can circumnavigate the building  you don t get cut off  you can move vertically throughout the building  we have really wide staircase  we have twice the elevator  twice the escalator compared to the georgia dome   <BRK> it also ha the capacity to add an additional     seat at the top of upper bowl  <BRK> the final figure came down a      billion  part of which came via the city  but the good news is    million of that wa financed from bank and investor  and falcon owner arthur blank covered some of it  too   <BRK> in addition to the    million in loan     million of the construction cost come from bond backed by atlanta hotel motel tax     million from the nfl and a yet undetermined amount from sale of personal seat license  blank is responsible for cost overrun  <BRK>
