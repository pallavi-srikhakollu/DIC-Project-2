in october  star and stripe fc reader overwhelmingly      selected deandre yedlin a the usmnt s top right back  yedlin seems to have the position locked down  although perhaps not for much longer  <BRK>poor premier league performance by yedlin and impressive showing from nick lima suggest that the united state men s national team could be on the verge of an intense competition for the starting right back spot  it is far from certain the yedlin will be the man lining up on the right side of defense in the   gold cup  <BRK>in the pat year  the following right back have earned usmnt call ups  deandre yedlin  nick lima  reggie cannon  keegan rosenberry  shaq moore  and eric lichaj  shaq moore is unlikely to be called up anytime soon  a he is currently playing for levante s reserve team  atletico levante ud  in the spanish third division   <BRK>eric lichaj s having a solid season for hull city  but is   year old and wa never highly rated by jurgen klinsmann or bruce arena  keegan rosenberry ha yet to earn a usmnt cap and did little last season to suggest that he is better than yedlin  lima  cannon  moore  and lichaj  <BRK>timothy chandler also remains an intriguing option  however he ha yet to play during the     bundesliga season  chandler wa initially expected to miss six month  after getting knee surgery in august  so he should return to training soon  it seems unlikely that moore  lichaj  rosenberry  or chandler will feature for the usmnt until after the   gold cup  if at all  <BRK>tyler adam ha been a national team regular since   and is capable of playing at right back  but ha predominantly featured a a defensive midfielder at both the club and international level  for this article  let s asume that usmnt coach gregg berhalter doe not view adam a a right back  <BRK>berhalter suggested that he will use the tactic he utilized against panama and costa rica in most match  if that s true  then it look like he will be deploying an inverted right wingback  nick lima excelled in this role during january friendly against panama and costa rica <BRK>lima wa asked to play more centrally than right back typically do  inverted  and made occasional late arriving run to join the usmnt attack at the top of the opposition s eighteen  lima s athleticism  solid communication from the usmnt backline  and the relative weakness of panama and costa rica allowed him to flourish in this unusual role  <BRK>if berhalter continues to ask his right back to play in such a manner  then there are three main competitor that could start during the   gold cup  deandre yedlin  nick lima  and reggie cannon  <BRK>yedlin ha played nearly every premier league game for newcastle united this season  but both he and the club have struggled  even in what wa arguably newcastle s best match of the season  a     home win over manchester city on january  th  yedlin wa quite inconsistent  <BRK>city s lone goal came a the result of a cross to the back post  in which yedlin failed to pick up david silva  while silva did not make clean contact with the cross  he redirected it to sergio aguero  aguero eaily scored from just a few yard out  yedlin s play in that match improved greatly after city s goal  but it doesn t change the fact that he made a crucial mistake  <BRK>more recently  yedlin had one of his worst performance of the seaon in a     draw against wolverhampton wanderer on february    he wa frequently caught out of position and the wolf attacker dribbled by him with eae  yedlin is not entirely to blame for his poor form  a it s quite difficult for defender to play well when their team is struggling  however  his recent performance are still disconcerting  <BRK>last season  nick lima wa one of the few bright spot on a san jose earthquake team that wa the worst in ml  lima is a good defender and demonstrated glimpse of the attacking prowess expected from a modern day right back in the january friendly <BRK>his odds of becoming a usmnt starter will increase if he can better his offensive output from the   ml season    goal and   assist in   appearance  <BRK>with the earthquake adding head coach matia almeyda and player such a cristian espinoza  on loan from villarreal   they seem to have become a better team  if lima can improve upon his solid   form  then it will be difficult for gregg berhalter to overlook him  <BRK>reggie cannon of fc dalla could also emerge a the usmnt s starting right back  the twice capped   year old did not appear in the january friendly against panama and costa rica  but ha proven to be a top ml defender  cannon started all but one of dalla    ml match and wa vital to the side that finished fourth in the western conference  he looked like an ml veteran  in just his first seaon a a consistent starter  and supposedly attracted interest from several liga mx team  <BRK>cannon s impressive athleticism make him well suited for berhalter s system  however  like lima  cannon s chance to start would greatly improve if he can increase his offensive production    goal and   assist in   appearance during the   ml season  <BRK>for now  deandre yedlin remains the usmnt s starting right back  however  if his performance for newcastle do not improve and cannon or lima excel in the early portion of the ml season  then yedlin may lose his starting job  <BRK>while many fan will be focusing on usmnt position battle at striker and centerback  leading up the   gold cup  keep your eye on the emerging fight to be the first choice right back  <BRK>
