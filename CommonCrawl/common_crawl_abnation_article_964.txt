demarcus cousin will make his     nba seaon debut on friday a the golden state warrior visit the la clipper      p m  et  espn   <BRK>cousin tore his achilles tendon just under a year ago amid another all star season  boogie wa well on his way to his third all nba honor and  more importantly to him  could taste the first playoff berth of his career  the new orleans pelican did ultimately make the playoff  burying the portland trail blazer in the first round before falling to  guess who   the warrior in five  cousin  of course  couldn t make his playoff debut because of the injury <BRK>once the pelican made a contract offer that cousin considered an insult  it appears that playoff debut became a priority  because boogie signed for a pittance with the one team that could absolutely be guaranteed a playoff nod in the loaded west  golden state  <BRK>now the experiment is beginning  not just for the warrior   adding a fifth star caliber player to the starting lineup   but for boogie  whose career could depend an awful lot on how this go <BRK>there s really so much in play here from every angle  let s run through it <BRK>

  <BRK>the warrior can get good shot every trip down when stephen curry and or kevin durant are on the floor with one of klay thompson and draymond green  or each other   cousin is a gravity monster that make magic out of dust and pull attention in the post and at the top of the key when he ha the ball  he s a really bombastic passer off the dribble and from standstill  <BRK>but where do his shot come from <BRK>this wa a question when durant arrived in    and the answer wa that the shot came from everywhere  boogie need some too  which impact curry  thompson  and green again  is draymond green going to shoot more than   shot in any game the rest of the seaon  isn t it a good thing if he doesn t  so long a his playmaking and defense stay excellent <BRK>from a baketball perspective  this is a facinating problem  how much talent is too much  is it possible to have too much when the talent is so malleable a curry  green  and durant are  and a deferential a thompson is <BRK>

  <BRK>defense ha always been an issue with cousin  in his sacramento day  it wa hard to discern what wa the fault of general team wide malaise or poor coaching  and what wa the fault of cousin  own skill and effort  boogie had a decent defensive campaign before the injury last season  and one presumes he will want to keep up with green  andre iguodala  and durant in golden state  his defensive hand have always been really good  and he s historically one of the best charge drawer in the league <BRK>but in a faster league  coming off a long injury  will he keep up  or  will there be lot of   v   possession for fleet of foot opponent  how hard will steve kerr press on boogie to run  how gassed will cousin get <BRK>will kerr have to pull cousin in critical stretch now or in the playoff because of defense  if so  how will boogie take that <BRK>cousin ha lasting friendship with curry and thompson  and ha struck up a camaraderie with green  he s a huge personality who ha a few locker room conflagration in his past  the warrior obviously had one huge conflagration this season between green and durant  <BRK>this is a fascinating little chemistry experiment  the warrior are pouring a highly reactive agent into what would appear to be a somewhat unstable compound  what could go wrong <BRK>about me Â  x nba champion   x final mvp   nd best basketball player in the world  im me  i do me  and i chill <BRK>seeking  flexibility  max compensation  championship contender  big market <BRK>the summer of   is shaping up to be a big one for some of the league s best  so sb nation s kristian winfield decided to play matchmaker  <BRK>here s a weird twist to all of this  cousin is the only top free agent guaranteed to switch team this summer  kyrie irving said he s staying with the celtic  kawhi leonard and kevin durant are questionable but noncommittal  and jimmy butler is a total mystery  <BRK>but cousin cannot stay with the warrior and get the salary he surely desire and will likely earn  the warrior have admitted this publicly  <BRK>if this go well  and perhaps even if it doesn t  he will get a maximum value contract from someone  who  who know  perhaps he ll strike up a fruitful relationship with durant and they ll jet off together  though the knicks  seen a kd s most likely landing spot  don t need a center   perhaps boogie s mutual appreciation society with lebron will send cousin to la  maybe he ll buy what steve ballmer and doc river are selling  maybe dalla will finally land a big free agent  maybe pat riley will make money move to get boogie in miami  <BRK> hey  you know who will have ton of cap space and potentially a need at center  the sacramento king  <BRK>if cousin look anything like the cousin of old  he becomes one of the three most interesting free agent of the summer based primarily on the completely wide open race to land him <BRK>this whole thing is such an open potential narrative with so many moving part  even if the warrior are overwhelming favorite to win the title  it s going to be fascinating to see how all of this play out and how it change the future for golden state  <BRK>hegemony can be boring  but boogie never is <BRK>
