patriot defensive coordinator  <BRK>dec     the brown will interview freddie kitchen for the head coaching job  mary kay cabot reported  they ll also give gregg williams a formal interview and then

kitchen  whose work a interim offensive coordinator helped unlock baker mayfield s potential and turn him into a rookie of the year frontrunner  ha got a real shot at the brown  top job <BRK>jan     the brown are backing away a little from mike mccarthy while they focus on other candidate <BRK>jan     cleveland is reportedly down to two finalist  interim offensive coordinator freddie kitchen and viking interim offensive coordinator kevin stefanski <BRK>jan     wow  the brown really did it  freddie kitchen is their next coach  most of the coaching staff  including former interim coach dc gregg williams and ol coach hard knock star bob wylie  will not return <BRK>jan     with kitchen now the head coach  the brown need a new offensive coordinator  one candidate is todd monken <BRK>jan     former lion oc  and nfl name champion  jim bob cooter will also interview for the brown  offensive coordinator position <BRK>jan     the brown also have a defensive coordinator opening  and vance joseph is already set to interview for it  they re also interested in chuck pagano <BRK>jan     with joseph going to the cardinal  the brown are primed to interview another recently fired head coach to take over at dc   this time  it s former arizona coach steve wilks <BRK>jan     mike priefer is going from viking special team coordinator to brown special team coordinator <BRK>jan     the brown are expected to hire steve wilks a their new defensive coordinator <BRK>jan     in addition to wilks  the brown found their other new coordinator  former bucs oc todd monken  that s quite the staff in cleveland <BRK>jan     the brown announce their new staff  including wilks  monken  stump mitchell a running back coach  and ryan lindley a quarterback coach <BRK>jan     kitchen added another impressive hire to his list   this time stealing alabama dc tosh lupoi away to coach his defensive line <BRK>jason garrett isn t going anywhere  not with the cowboy headed to the playoff  the jones family like garrett  but they ve made it clear that they expect the team to be contender  on the other hand  there could be move among garrett s staff  <BRK>dec     offensive coordinator scott linehan could get the boot  according to ian rapoport  <BRK>jan     cowboy defensive coordinator rod marinelli is hoping dallas can keep kris richard around <BRK>jan     jaon garrett said he isn t planning any major coaching staff change  and that includes keeping scott linehan around a oc   but then he quickly forgot about that and said no decision had been made  after a talk with the jones  so maybe linehan s job isn t safe <BRK>jan     just one more thing  marc colombo is returning to dalla a the new ol coach <BRK>jan     oc scott linehan got fired despite garrett s best effort <BRK>jan     report suggest kellen moore   who wa the club s backup quarterback a recently a     will be the cowboy  next offensive coordinator <BRK>jan     it s officially moore  whose meteoric rise through the coaching rank will make him an nfl oc just one seaon after retiring a a player  <BRK>vance joseph made a pretty good cae for why the bronco should fire him back in week   when he made one of the worst coaching decision of his short career  and there are a lot to choose from   but then the bronco went on a three game win streak and had the eaiest path to an afc wild card bid  that would have made it impossible for john elway to fire him  nope  joseph s bronco went out and lost the next three  kicking them firmly out of postseaon contention  a expected  they fired joseph the day after the seaon ended  <BRK>dec     it say a lot that someone let it be known that the bronco almost hired mike shanahan a year ago  <BRK>dec     the bronco had been one of the team said to be interested in john harbaugh should the raven fire him  that hope got shot down when the raven announced he d be back  <BRK>dec     it s not out of the question that joseph stick around  however  one possibility in that scenario is that elway brings in his old pal gary kubiak to run the offense  according to rapoport  that seems like it d be a huge problem since kubiak ha been the head coach there before and his presence and connection with elway would undercut the head coach  <BRK>dec     he s out  fired  <BRK>dec     schefter report that the bronco have requested permission to interview brian flores and former titan head coach and steelers ol coach mike munchak <BRK>dec     the bronco have asked to interview bear dc vic fangio  though it ll have to wait with his team set to play on wild card weekend  <BRK>dec     don t expect the bronco to go back to the adam gase well or the mike shanahan well  former coach gary kubiak could be an oc candidate  however <BRK>dec     john elway denied the bronco were looking to bring back mike shanahan  but he didn t deny they d be willing to trade draft pick for a coach  if so  john harbaugh could be a candidate  right now  though  that doesn t look likely <BRK>dec     ram quarterback coach zac taylor will have the chance to convince elway he s the right guy to dig the bronco  offense out of it current hole <BRK>dec     the team is expected to interview former colt coach chuck pagano  though it ha not formally requested to do so yet <BRK>jan     pagano will be the first candidate to interview with the bronco  followed by taylor  munchak  flores  and fangio <BRK>jan     mike munchak  who already met with the bronco  ha a lot of interest in the job <BRK>jan     gary kubiak is a major part of the bronco  rebuilding plan  the club isn t allowing him to interview for oc job anywhere else in the league <BRK>jan     the bronco seem to be down to either vic fangio or mike munchak  with fangio looking like the frontrunner <BRK>jan       year old vic fangio is a head coach for the first time <BRK>jan     gary kubiak is expected to return to the bronco coaching staff a the oc <BRK>jan     welp  now gary kubiak will not be the oc <BRK>jan     mike munchak didn t get the head coaching job  but the bronco still want to hire him  perhaps a ol coach <BRK>jan     with report that the bronco were looking for an innovative offensive mind  they tried to set up one interview for the oc job   er qb coach rich scangarello  the  er denied the request <BRK>jan     mike munchak is joining the bronco after all     a the ol coach <BRK>jan     rich scangarello is expected to be the new oc  while former bear secondary coach ed donatell is following vic fangio to denver to become his new dc <BRK>matt patricia s first year in detroit ha been disappointing enough to make people think that maybe jim caldwell wasn t such a bad coach after all  but patricia isn t going anywhere  he s only in his first season  and he and the general manager  bob quinn  are both former belichickians  <BRK>but there could be change among the coordinator  most likely offensive coordinator jim bob cooter  who predates patricia and whose contract is up after this season  <BRK>jan    yep  jim bob cooter is out  <BRK>jan     and former seahawks oc darrell bevell is in <BRK>the packer fired mike mccarthy after an embarrasing home loss to the arizona cardinal in week    joe philbin took over a the interim coach  whoever they end up hiring inherits a pretty good situation  one ripe for a quick turnaround in    however  that person is going to have to do more for aaron rodgers than mccarthy did  <BRK>dec     is patriot offensive coordinator josh mcdaniels in the mix  he could be  according to yahoo s charles robinson <BRK>dec     northwestern s pat fitzgerald wa mentioned by mmqb s albert breer a another possibility in green bay  <BRK>dec     the team got a pair of early interview out of the way  sitting down with former colt head coach chuck

divisional round of the playoff  that s where the season ended  but the future is still bright  surely there won t be many coaching change  right  especially with an ol that protected andrew luck more than he ever ha been in his career  <BRK>oh <BRK>stunner  the  colt are letting ol coach dave deguglielmo go  source say  that line made tremendous leap this season  but frank reich want his own guy  deguglielmo wa the only offensive coach josh mcdaniels had hired  reich is actually recommending him to other coach <BRK>no team disappointed more this season than the jaguar  a play away from a super bowl bid last place in the afc south  it wasn t supposed to be this way  but really  is anyone surprised that this happened when the team decided to sign blake bortles to an extension  the team s performance in   likely bought head coach doug marrone and gm dave caldwell another season  at least  both are expected to keep their job for    according to ian rapoport of the nfl network  <BRK>but there will be some coaching change in jacksonville  the team fired offensive coordinator nathaniel hackett in november  so they ll be in the market for a prodigious offensive mind  hopefully  to help
