it s the most wonderful time of the year  nfl free agency  we ve already seen a few blockbuster move unfold to kick off the new league year  which doesn t begin until march    antonio brown wa traded  not to the bill but to the raider  the raven sent joe flacco to the bronco  which gave the latter the space to trade case keenum to wahington  those will all become official wednesday <BRK>the legal tampering period start on march    so expect a few more free agent signing and trade to leak beforehand  a the rest roll in  we ll be grading each move by two criterion  how good it is in the short term and in the long term  <BRK>our grade will surely be   percent correct  after all  we are omnipotent and can predict the future here at sb nation  trut u with your free agency need <BRK>we ll be updating this list with grade a we move throughout the offseaon  the newest signing will be on the top of the page <BRK>after cutting justin houston and trading dee ford to the  er  the chief desperately needed body at defensive end before the nfl draft  they found a solid player on the trading block in brown defensive end emmanuel ogbah  ogbah became expendable for the brown after they traded for olivier vernon from the giant <BRK>the brown needed a safety after trading away jabrill pepper and waiving derrick kindred and it look like they found that guy in eric murray  murray played about    of the snap for the chief last year and recorded   tackle and   interception  <BRK>this seems like a solid deal for both side  each team got a starter at a position of need that isn t costly considering both player are still on their rookie deal <BRK>short term grade  b for bothlong term grade  b for both<BRK>the colt added to their pa rush by signing longtime chief edge rusher justin houston to a two year deal worth    million  houston isn t quite a dominant a he wa in the pat  but he s not completely wahed up by any stretch  houston had   sack and wa the  th ranked edge defender in the league according to pro football focus <BRK>houston can immediately be a positive presence for a colt defense that could use some juice off the edge  he should be able to help them improve

and ha played for two other afc eat team  plus  the two year     million deal unites him with the other fitzmagic  minkah fitzpatrick  the dolphin didn t overpay for the   year old quarterback  which is good  but the question now is what they ll do about the future  will they draft a qb with the  th pick or do they plan to tank for one in    such a tua tagovailoa  if it s the latter  it s a risky move  but one that might pay off in the long run <BRK>short term grade  blong term grade  b <BRK>with more than    million in   cap saving on the table for the dolphin  parting way with tannehill wa looking inevitable  it wa a decision to the team reportedly made over a month ago  so from miami s perspective  it s a win just to get anything in a deal <BRK>granted  the dolphin didn t get much  they drop a round late in the draft this year and pick up a mid round selection next year  the real win is clearing his salary <BRK>for the titan  they get a capable backup quarterback   better than blaine gabbert   for the oft injured marcus mariota  his lofty salary is gone too  because his contract wa ripped up upon arrival and replaced with a one year     million deal  <BRK>short term grade

full strength   just a huge  massive  if    he s a game changer in the secondary  verrett had three interception and   pass defensed in    providing a defensive spark and a no fly zone in   game that fall  that wa enough to make the charger hopeful he could make good on his potential  but injury prevented that  now san francisco get to make a low risk bet on the dynamic cornerback  at only

packer signed adrian amos away from chicago to fill the spot vacated by clinton dix in last year s trade with washington  now the  bear close the loop by adding the former first round pick on a one

eddie jackson to be the freewheeling playmaker that boosted the bear in    clinton dix ha the talent to get there  and this single season deal could be a major bargain for the reigning nfc north champ

williams is a receiver that thrives on making big play down the field  so hopefully derek carr will open it up and take more shot down the field than he did last year  <BRK>if the raider can keep carr up right  this offense ha the potential to be much better than it wa a year ago  williams  deal is four year     million with    million guaranteed  the    million per year average rank  th in the nfl

a<BRK>baltimore shocked the world by signing the top safety on the market in earl thomas to a four year deal worth    million with    million guaranteed  they needed to replace eric weddle  who they cut in free agency <BRK>earl thomas will do  thomas is legitimately one of the best safety in the history of the game  since he wa drafted in    thomas ha   interception and   forced fumble while being the leader of one of the best pas defense we ve seen over the past decade  <BRK>baltimore s secondary is now absolutely loaded  thomas will be joining marlon humphrey  brandon carr  tony jefferson  tavon young  and jimmy smith for what might be the best secondary in the league  <BRK>this is a shrewd move by baltimore to agree to term with earl thoma just one day after the brown traded for superstar wide receiver odell beckham jr  a the brown loaded up on pas catcher  the raven added one of the best defensive back to ever play <BRK>the one red flag with this deal is that thomas ha been a bit banged up in recent season  over the past three season  thomas ha played in   of   possible game and played in just four game last season  giving him a four year deal is a bit of a risk  but a risk worth taking for a team that s trying to win now and in the future with young quarterback lamar jackson <BRK>short term grade  along term grade  b <BRK>this move is a bit confusing  once lamar jackson took over a the starting quarterback  the raven running game pretty much became automatic  former undrafted running back gu edward averaged     yard per carry once jackson took over a

with the jet is four year       million <BRK>the jet have now added two talented playmaker on offense in jamison crowder and le veon bell  which should help sam darnold a he enters his second seaon in the nfl  this will also give new head coach adam gae weapon to work with while he get used to calling play with a new team <BRK>le veon received    million guaranteed  which is more guaranteed money than the steelers offered him a year ago  in the short term  the jet aren t hurting for space  so they might a well use it on someone that will make like eaier for their young quarterback <BRK>hopefully for the jet  le veon is in good shape to attack the season  if he can get back to being an all pro running back that positively affect the passing game  this will be a great addition for their offense  running back typically don t get paid like this  but bell is a special player <BRK>short term grade  a long term grade  b <BRK>the titan lost brian orakpo to retirement and felt the need to add a pas rusher to pair with harold landry  wake    year old  wa given a three year deal by the titan worth    million with    million guaranteed  even though wake is    he can still bring some pas rush  he had six sack and   quarterback hit this past season  <BRK>obviously  the risk here is giving a multiyear deal to a player that could dramatically fall off at any point  wake will be   if he make it through the end of this deal  <BRK>short term grade  blong term grade  c<BRK>in another blockbuster trade  the  er grabbed pro bowl pas rusher dee ford from the kansa city chief  the

season  ford will turn   before the start of the season  but he should still have a lot of good year ahead of him  <BRK>if solomon thomas can take the next step and become the impact defensive lineman that the  er drafted third overall  then san francisco will have a hellacious pas rush trio with thomas  ford  and deforest buckner <BRK>it s a bit strange that the chief are trading away dee ford

into the mix too  cleveland ha an offense that s ready to erupt and take over the afc north this year  also  cleveland get to keep all of their   draft pick  what a damn deal for the brown <BRK>the giant  plan here is a little bit confusing  they just gave beckham a big deal last season and are now dealing him for pick  while incurring a dead cap hit  eli manning hasn t played well over the past few season  so getting rid of his top receiving target   who is among the elite of the elite at his position   doesn t really make much sense  you also have to remember that the giant will be breaking

 ha dealt with injury over the past few season  but is still a very effective blocker when he s on the field  <BRK>getting paradis on a three year     million deal is a good get for the panther  the

letting starting guard quinton spain test the free agent market  they had a void to fill at left guard  they filled that spot by signing ram left guard rodger saffold to a four year deal worth    million with      million guaranteed  <BRK>saffold is a talented guard that really hit his stride over the past two year with sean mcvay pulling the string for the ram  offense  saffold should immediately upgrade the titan offensive line  but giving out a four year deal to a   year old guard with injury issue is a pretty big gamble  <BRK>short term grade  b long term grade  c<BRK>houston s

added along with mitch morse  nsekhe ha long been seen a one of the top backup offensive linemen in the league  whenever wahington wa without trent williams or morgan moses  nsekhe had no problem filling in for them for game at a time  <BRK>if nsekhe can continue to play at the level he did a a part time starter  then the bill will have found a valuable piece along their offensive line  it s reportedly a two year       million dollar deal with      million guaranteed  great signing for both party <BRK>short term grade  along term grade  a<BRK>buffalo double dipped at receiver to start off the free agency period  they signed former cowboy slot receiver cole beasley to a four year     million dollar deal  <BRK>that s a hefty amount of money for a receiver that ha never had a   yard season  still  it s a good deal in the short term for the bill  they ve now really upgraded their receiver room with john brown and cole beasley  at the same time  it s a big odd to lock up a long term deal to a receiver whose production han t really been there <BRK>short term grade  blong term grade  c<BRK>we got the first big twist of free agency when free agent linebacker anthony barr reversed course on his decision to sign with the new york jet and stayed home with the minnesota viking  barr is an extremely talented player that doe a bit of everything for mike zimmer s defense    wa a bit of a down year for him  but he s still young enough    by the start of the season  to get the ship righted for the rest of his career  <BRK>barr s deal with the viking is five year

yard and five touchdown  <BRK>brown never really developed a chemistry with raven quarterback lamar jackson  but he still showed that he s a talented receiver that can play a big role in an offense

offensive line talent in new orleans compared to what he saw in minnesota <BRK>this is a solid deal for the saint who likely wouldn t have been able to address their running back need until the third

first round linebacker deone buccanon  so they dipped their foot into the free agency market and signed former eagle linebacker jordan hick  <BRK>when healthy  hick legitimately ha the ability to be one of the best linebacker in the league  unfortunately for hick  health ha eluded him during his four year career  hick ha only made it through a full   game season once  which came in    over the

offensive linemen billy turner  turner will compete with justin mccray and lane taylor for a starting guard spot  turner received a four year     million deal with    million guaranteed  he ll be

free agency  so they opted to take care of an in house need by re signing teddy bridgewater to backup drew brees <BRK>the deal make sense on both end  new orleans traded a third round pick for bridgewater during the preseason and he likely wasn t going to get a big enough deal to net them a third round compensatory pick in the   nfl draft  bridgewater turned down a bigger deal from the

preston smith  za darius smith  kenny clark  mike daniel  and   breakout player kyler fackrell  the packer will be able to get after the quarterback in   <BRK>the move also give green bay the latitude to release nick perry  who failed to live up to his   sack   over the past two season  perry wa due a     m roster bonus by the end of the week  but wa cut shortly after za darius smith and preston

of the jaguar vaunted   defense that sprung them to the afc championship <BRK>gipson is a solid safety that  at his peak  is one of the few guy that can effectively play single high safety over the

a pro football focus  third ranked safety behind earl thoma and harrison smith   that s pretty good company to be in <BRK>by signing amos  the packer were able to take away a strong defensive piece from the bear while upgrading their own defense  the money han t been released yet  but amos a versatile safety that ha the chance to shine in mike pettine s defense <BRK>amos is a similar player to ha ha clinton dix  who played well in wisconsin but ultimately wore out his welcome and wa shipped off to wahington  he also excelled under defensive coordinator vic fangio  who tends to get more out

will pay him     m more each year than luke kuechly get  and while mosley is a stout interior presence who can make tackle from sideline to sideline  the jet are paying elite pas rusher money for a guy with     sack over the last three season <BRK>the jet needed to make a splash to put the todd bowles era in their rear view  dropping a record setting contract to snag a perennial pro bowler is one way to do it  <BRK>still  that s so  so  so much money for an inside linebacker  with nearly    million in salary cap space this spring  this is a splurge the club can afford in    the question is

a lot of football left in him <BRK>short term grade  along term grade  b <BRK>the colt added big bodied receiver to play with andrew luck by signing former panther receiver devin funchess to a one

eats up a big chunk of space in what had been a perilous cap situation to begin with  releasing berry would only provide about      million of room  so it seems more likely mathieu is more an expensive insurance policy for an all star defender who ha only played three regular season game the past two year <BRK>in that case  it s a pretty great move  even if it hamstring the team s move going forward  mathieu played at a high level with houston last fall  providing solid coverage and dynamic tackling across the field   including a career high three sack  he ll only be   year old in    and his presence could give kansa city the centerfield coverage that mitigates the departure of justin houston  released  and dee ford  franchise  could be traded  from the club s pas rush  if

morse is the next step <BRK>morse is a great player when he s on the field  but ha just played in   regular season game for the chief over the past two season  healthy or not  morse is a gigantic upgrade for the bill and will provide a steady blocker in the run and pas game <BRK>the bill made morse the highest paid center the league with a four year     million deal  that s a big risk

ha one year left to make sure marcus mariota is the franchise quarterback of the future   surrounding him with a many weapon a possible give him the best chance at success  an average of    million
