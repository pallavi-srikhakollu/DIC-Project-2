 <BRK> pogba did not feature in that first liverpool match  which wa a     defeat at anfield that saw mourinho sacked following the contest   <BRK> not getting off the bench wa the culmination of the midfielder finding himself on the outside looking in on mourinho s final lineup in the premier league  but solskjaer suggested there may have been other reason for him featuring le   <BRK>  knowing him he want to win  he want to be the best   solksjaer said   you would be surprised the number of minute he s played  apart from david  de gea  and maybe nemanja  matic  he ha played the most minute for u in the league   <BRK>  there wa a perception that jose left him out all the time  maybe he doe not have the energy to do it  who know    <BRK> pogba ha also been slammed in the past for focus on his appearance  with the accusation again coming down that he doe not put the same effort into his football   <BRK> but solskjaer take a different stance on the matter  believing those thing make pogba happy  which in turn make him more productive   <BRK>  he is a leader in training  he is a leader in the dressing room   solskjaer said   <BRK>  player are allowed to be themselves  he spends a lot of energy being a leader on and off the pitch  if you want the nice car  different haircut   <BRK>  i can t do anything about my grey hair  but it is not a problem that have whatever haircut you want  it ha never been a problem with paul   <BRK>  i remember when he wa   he wanted to feel good  if you feel good you will play well    <BRK>
