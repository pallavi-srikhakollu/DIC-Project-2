considering the wave of young american talent that ha made it way to germany in recent year  leading to the development of the like of christian pulisic and weston mckennie  perhaps it is inevitable that the u s  national team s lengthy search for a reliable left back will also find an answer in germany  <BRK> chris gloster know about the usmnt s struggle at the left back position  and the   year old defender is hoping to put himself in position to be a solution to the problem  <BRK> currently featuring in the under   team for bundesliga side hannover    gloster is an under the radar prospect to casual u s  soccer fan  but fan that were able to watch him star for the u s  under   national team on it run to the concacaf championship last november saw the kind of left back they ve been dreaming off for the usmnt  <BRK> tall  fast  tough defensively  skilled offensively  and some swagger thrown in for good measure  <BRK>  i can t believe how far he s come along in the lat year and a half   u s  under   coach tab ramos told goal when aked about gloster   in the u   world cup he wa good  but now i think gloster would be a starter in ml  i think for almost any team  a a left back   <BRK> gloster spent his formative year playing in new york red bull academy  where he played alongside u s  national team midfielder tyler adam  the montclair  new jersey native eventually joined the u s  under   national team residency program in florida  but wound up deciding to make the move to germany rather than signing with his hometown club  <BRK> it wa a decision that didn t come easily for him  <BRK>  it wa really tough because before i started realizing i wanted to play in europe they were giving me a lot of opportunity to train with the first team and with the usl   gloster told goal   i even made my usl debut  played   minute  and it wa tough for me and my family because that club formed me into the player i am now  <BRK>  i grew up around that club  the first game i watched wa at red bull arena  you always want to play in your hometown and in front of your friend and family  it wa tough but i realized i needed to go to europe   <BRK>
