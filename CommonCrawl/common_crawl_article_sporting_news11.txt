but an even better person 
thank you   andy_murray  ausopen pic twitter com urpblc zy  <BRK> murray continued   i would definitely play wimbledon if i didn t have the operation because my hip isn t going to be much worse off after this match  <BRK>  my hip is screwed anyway so it s not like the match  against bautista agut  is going to make it any worse than what it is  <BRK>  if i took a few month off and didn t play  i could definitely get myself on the court to play wimbledon one last time  i could be competitive  i wa competitive here against a top player with very little practice and match   and grass is a better surface for me  <BRK>  option b give me the best chance of playing at wimbledon  the first option make my life a lot more comfortable and enjoyable  but potentially mean i never play again and also miss wimbledon  that s what i need to decide   <BRK>
