it s certainly a strange old world  football <BRK>it s a world where trivial issue can be amplified  given prime time prominence and endless air time  while other  more serious matter are left alone  brushed under the carpet  to be kept there until someone is brave enough to shine a light <BRK>witness  for example  the  spygate  scandal at leeds united last week  the story of marcelo bielsa instructing a member of staff to covertly observe a derby county training session  the reaction to that bordered on the hysterical  with talk of  moral code  and quaint notion of  respect  between club and manager <BRK>the point missed the like of martin keown  jermaine jena and stuart pearce  all of whom voiced predictably strong  indignant opinion on the matter  is football s fiercely competitive nature  the fact that any advantage  be it financial  tactical  physical or psychological will be sought it participant <BRK>observing rival  training session is not new  nor it is a breach of the sport s ethic  certainly no more than  say  a player texting a friend at another club to find out their likely starting xi  believe me  they both happen regularly <BRK>the issue of diving is another which is guaranteed to bring football s moral arbiter to the table  and they ve been queuing up of late to have their say on the latest  storm   at the eye of it stand   or fall  if you prefer   mohamed salah <BRK>it is one of those curious statistical quirk that since boxing day  liverpool have been awarded four penalty in four premier league game  with salah responsible for three of those  prior to that  the red had been awarded just one spot kick in their opening   league match  salah  of course  won that one too  against saturday s opponent  crystal palace <BRK>last weekend s penalty proved decisive  settling a tense encounter with brighton at the amex stadium <BRK>afterwards  with little else to discus after another clean sheet and an  th league win of the campaign for the league leader  the debate centred on the egyptian  and whether he wa in danger of  making a name for himself   and not the good kind  <BRK>

<BRK> i think he ll have to be careful   said andy gray  the former everton striker and one time sky sport commentator   i m a little concerned how easily mo salah is going to ground these day  especially in the penalty area  <BRK>richard key  his partner in crime at sky and now bein sport  agreed  adding  i think he s getting into the habit of making the most of challenge <BRK>at the amex  the brighton supporter booed salah until the final whistle  chanting      to the referee  a liverpool sealed the three point <BRK>their ire really should have been directed towards their own player  pascal gross  whose naivety and lack of defensive instinct proved so costly <BRK>gross  just a mamadou sakho  paul dummett and sokratis papatathopolous did earlier in the campaign  paid the price for allowing salah to get behind them  reacting in a panic making contact with the forward  in this day and age  it s a game not worth playing <BRK>and that  really  is the rub <BRK>pundit such a gray and key   or espn s craig burley  who labelled salah  pathetic  after he tumbled against newcatle on boxing day   belong to a different era  to a sport with different rule <BRK>they criticise salah   or harry kane  or raheem sterling  or jamie vardy  or wilfried zaha   because they don t understand the way the sport ha evolved  and is continuing to do so  they see thing in black and white  with nothing in between  <BRK>funnily enough  there seems to be none of the same outrage when  let s say  a defender facing his own goal  wait for contact  from an attacker in order to win a cheap free kick and relieve the pressure on his side  or when a full back tell the referee he got the ball when the world can see he did anything but <BRK>in both case  the aim is the same  to force the official into a decision  to gain an advantage for their side  we can take it further  too  compare  if you will  the reaction to a  simulation  incident to that of a potential red card tackle <BRK>which damage the game more  a player going to ground when having his shirt pulled in the penalty area  or a   stone defender flying  stud showing  into another player s ankle  shin or knee <BRK>witness how those same pundit  brought up in a world where  leaving a bit  on an opponent wa to be applauded   encouraged even   make allowance for such challenge   part of the game  they ll say  aggression is to be admired  but winning your side a  soft  penalty is not  even if the aim of both is the same <BRK>

<BRK>this is not a liverpool moan  although the red do currently have a player  joe gomez  sidelined after a  ball winning  challenge from burnley s ben mee last month   a fantastic tackle   sean dyche called it  presumably  the claret bos would be equally impressed if it wa his player on the receiving end <BRK>rather  this is a debate which cut to the core of football in this country <BRK>going to ground under a foul   and gross  challenge on salah wa a foul  don t let anyone tell you otherwise   can  earn you a reputation   yet endangering the safety of an opponent can be excused  accepted <BRK> you can t take tackle out of the game   mee said  his view will be echoed across the sport  no doubt <BRK>and yet we have seen rule change designed to do exactly that  the  tackle from behind  wa outlawed in the  s  with rule tightened further before the   world cup  it wa a sensible decision  even if it made life tougher for defender  who were forced to modify their game  to stay on their foot more  to be le reckle a a result <BRK>in this correspondent s view  the same sort of clampdown is needed on challenge which  take the ball  but at such force that the follow through put the opponent at risk <BRK>we know the type  and it would be nice to see manager  player and pundit begin to accept that tackle which break bone  rupture ligament and split shin are a much  part of the game  a terrace racism  crumbling stadium and the cup winner  cup <BRK>the game ha changed  the rule have changed  and it is time attitude changed <BRK>a for salah  his job is simple  to keep doing what he s doing  and if defender refuse to learn the lesson of sakho and dummett  sokratis and gross  then more fool them   <BRK>
