former arsenal bos arsene wenger would be  a great chelsea manager  if he were to make a shock return to the premier league  according to david seaman <BRK>wenger ended his   year spell with arsenal at the end of last season and is still out of a job despite insisting he is not retired <BRK>the frenchman ha been linked with a whole host of job but he is yet to step back into management since leaving the gunner last year <BRK>with maurizio sarri under pressure at chelsea  with just three game to save his job  former arsenal goalkeeper seaman ha tipped his old bos to take the rein at stamford bridge <BRK>speaking to talksport  seaman said   arsene always said he wouldn t come back to the premier league because of his love for arsenal  that he wouldn t feel right competing against arsenal <BRK> but  obviously  time s a healer and he could think   i want to go back there and prove a few people wrong  <BRK> for me  arsene got a lot of criticism that wasn t deserved over his last few year at arsenal <BRK> it look like there could be a vacancy at chelsea quite soon  depending on their next three game  which are three big game for chelsea <BRK> he d be great there  i think  he d be great anywhere  he s a fantastic manager <BRK> i would love to see him back  but i don t think it would happen  <BRK>although wenger is one of the most qualified manager available at the moment  it is likely he would be an unpopular appointment at stamford bridge after   year of affiliation with arsenal <BRK>however  wenger ha said he will not come back to the premier league   at the moment  i m having a good rest and i watch football a lot  i said many time maybe the best way is not to be in england because i spent so much time at the same club it would seem odd to go somewhere else  <BRK>
