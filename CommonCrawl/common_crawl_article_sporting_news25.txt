been claiming since lat summer that he is the real world champion  even carrying around his own customized title  that show will take place on friday  march  th at sam town s live in la vega and airing live on pay per view and for member of the subscription based honor club streaming network via rohwrestling com <BRK>lethal   now a two time roh world champion   recently made history of his own  breaking the record for the most combined day a champion and surpasing samoa joe s record of   day <BRK>while he wa aware of the record  lethal had no idea that he wa anywhere close to breaking it <BRK> when i wa pulled aside and they said you know  you re about to beat joe s record of holding the belt for a certain amount of time  i said   no way  that s insane    lethal exclaimed   i remember being in ring of honor when joe wa champion and i wa his protégé and i would come to the ring holding his towel  i didn t think anyone would ever beat his record  <BRK>lethal ha achieved high status in roh to the point where you can t tell the history of the promotion without his name being one of the first mentioned  he still remembers his first tenure in roh early in his career from     when he felt like the young guy who didn t belong in that spot yet <BRK> i really felt like my skill and my time in the wrestling business  i shouldn t have been in ring of honor   said lethal   i somehow had slipped through the crack  but luckily i wa there and i wa learning every chance that i got because there s so many people to learn from  <BRK>he added   i can only begin to imagine how cool it would be if there s someone now in ring of honor  someone who just came from our ring of honor dojo  one of the younger guy who are now in the shoe that i wa in and in a few year will be a major player  i like to think story like that constantly go on  it s never ending  there s going to be someone here who probably doesn t feel like they belong just like i did  their experience level is not where it should be  but everybody you step in the ring with in this company  there s something to learn from  <BRK>the   year old lethal began his second world title reign last summer when he defeated former champion dalton castle  cody rhodes  and matt taven in a fatal four way match  this time around  he feel like it s a more important achievement to win the title again <BRK> it s proof  in my opinion  that what you did the first time and what i particularly did the first time that i wa ring of honor champion  wa at least interesting enough to try it again   explained lethal   this one mean more to me that the first time because it prof  not from a fan standpoint or from my standpoint  but from the company i work for and represent that from their mind  i should have another go because what i did the first time wa at least interesting enough to have a second go around   <BRK>last november  lethal signed a new multi year contract with ring of honor  for him  there wa never a question of where he wanted to be <BRK> here s the thing that made me fall in love with them   lethal explained   even when i wa just that kid that didn t feel like i belonged  my skill level wa nowhere near a cm punk or austin aries or alex shelley at the time  but yet i wa still wrestling with those guy  even then  this company ha always gone above and beyond for me  this company ha always taken great care of me  i ve never had a reason to even dream about wanting to go somewhere else  i love this place  <BRK>one of my fav picture<BRK>a post shared jay lethal   thelethaljay  on aug      at    pm pdt<BRK>there have been some big name that recently left the company with the young buck  matt and nick jackson   cody rhodes  and adam page leaving at the end of   to be founding block of the new all elite wrestling promotion  it s nothing new to roh  which ha seen plenty of talent come and go over the year from the like of samoa joe and bryan danielson  now daniel bryan in wwe  to aj style and adam cole <BRK> i feel that ring of honor ha always been in the rebuilding phae   said lethal   ring of honor  in all the time i ve known it  it s never been fully settled  it s always in this rebuilding phae because other roster out there constantly pluck from the ring of honor roster to make their roster better  look at all of the company out there and their champion  most of them came through and from ring of honor <BRK> i think the winning formula is you don t try and replace those guy   he continued   how do you replace the young buck  how do you replace a cody rhodes or an aj style  that hole in your tapestry is going to be there  but you have to have sense enough to know that hole leaf some character  that hole ha done some great work and you don t try to cover that up  it just add character  <BRK>in the meantime  roh ha been aggressive in signing talent  that includes jeff cobb  mark hakins  pco and brody king along with mexican star bandido and rush with a roster that still includes dalton castle  marty scurll  mark and jay briscoe and others along with a continuing partnership with njpw <BRK> ultimately  it s the fan that win because this is going to lead to some fresh and cool thing that not only did you not think were possible before  not only some thing that you didn t know you wanted to see until you saw them  but to keep fan interested  you have to give them something that they ve never seen before   said lethal <BRK>he continued   with there being so many option for wrestler  there s so many option to give them something they ve never seen before whether it s two guy from different side of the world that you never thought they d be in the same ring because they ve always worked for two separate company  now  there s a dream match that we didn t know would have been a dream match because it s never been possible  the fan are going to be the ultimate winner and if the wrestler can make a few extra buck  kudos to them  <BRK><BRK>for now  lethal continues to have tunnel vision looking towards the g  supercard on april   at madison square garden  a lot can happen between now and then  but that hasn t stopped him from thinking about the historic show <BRK> to me  it s all about walking in a the champion   explained lethal   if i don t leave a the champion  that wouldn t be too heart breaking for me  but going in a the champion  they could never take anything away from me after that  if i can hold onto this belt   we do have one more pay per view in march  i have to get through that first  if i can walk into madison square garden a the champion  that s what i would really like  winning the big one in madison square garden  that would be cool  but to me  being the first ring of honor champion walking into madison square garden and defending the belt  that s the coolest part to me  <BRK>lethal ha already put together a short list of who he would like to face at the garden that includes both roh and njpw star <BRK> i ve never had a single match with  hiroshi  tanahashi or  kazuchika  okada   said lethal   when i think back to some of my favorite match  there s one that stick out to me and that s the first time i won the ring of honor championship against jay briscoe  that match meant a lot to me for several reason  but one of the most important one is that every time with jay briscoe  he force me to dig down deep and bring out something special  he really make me perform at my highest level and something i didn t know wa possible  any one of those three would be amazing  but then again  i d love to be in that spot with anybody  <BRK>that includes a possible champion versus champion match with newly crowned iwgp heavyweight champion jay white <BRK> that would be incredible   said lethal   i would love it  in fact  ring of honor ha it new japan show with the roster traveling to japan for our yearly  honor rising  event  i ll get to see and congratulate jay white in person  <BRK>join dazn and watch more than   fight night a year<BRK>there are plenty of possibility  but lethal ha to keep the roh world championship until the momentous date <BRK> that s all i can think about   lethal said   in fact  in the history of the business  i think the coolest story have been when it come to that big show   winning the big one at the big one  <BRK>brian fritz can be reached at btrfritz gmail com  follow
