match

stan take first set         ausopen pic twitter com kxlhhfbh q<BRK>it wa much the same in the second set  with both player smacking the ball hard and giving little opportunity for break point  raonic managed to break wawrinka s serve early in the set  but the swiss returned the favour five game later a neither man looked to give an inch <BRK>predictably  the set required a tiebreak  this time with raonic claming the advantage <BRK>boom 
    angled forehand winner
      unreturnable serve
  a    rd set at the  ausopen 
raonic level the score with wawrinka at                 gocanada  teammilos pic twitter com ccnbred gu<BRK>the third set wa even more straightforward  with neither man even having an opportunity for a break point  with both raonic and wawrinka holding serve until yet another tiebreak wa needed  the most noteworthy event in the set wa a brief rain delay that required worker to dry the court while the roof wa closed at rod laver arena <BRK>
