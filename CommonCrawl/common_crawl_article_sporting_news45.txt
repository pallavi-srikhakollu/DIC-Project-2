the spectre of the away goal haunt every champion league knockout tie <BRK>even when an away goal is not in play  the very thought of it pervades match  coach on either side too aware of it significance <BRK>the onus on the home team is not to concede one  a we saw on tuesday night when lyon and liverpool held barcelona and bayern munich scoreless  in lyon s cae they might consider it a job well done but there will be fear about what lionel messi and co  might do at camp nou <BRK>sign up with dazn to watch every champion league match live and on demand<BRK>in the other tie  the scoreless draw would appear to be better for liverpool than bayern <BRK>given the host at anfield were missing virgil van dijk  joe gomez and dejan lovren from the centre of their defence  they will be relieved and hope to be never a weakened in the heart of their defence for a big knockout tie again <BRK>the prospect of scoring in munich is a realistic one  especially considering how unpredictable bayern have been in a defensive sense this season under niko kovac <BRK>if they can repeat what four bundesliga team and ajax have done this season  then liverpool wil go through  namely score and prevent bayern winning  they are capable of doing both <BRK>last friday away at augsburg bayern were     down to a leon goretzka own goal inside   second  bayern are not a clean sheet machine and liverpool will fancy their chance  especially with firebrand defender joshua kimmich out of the return through suspension <BRK>

<BRK>jurgen klopp described the result afterwards a not perfect  but enough  these were two well matched team engaged in a very even and watchable contest  liverpool should draw confidence from that because in van dijk they were arguably missing their best player  who will return for the second leg <BRK>bayern   for their part   probably obtained a better result than they themselves expected  the travelling press pack the night before the game engaged in a traditional prediction contest while out for dinner  there were   odd journalist over from germany and the large majority picked liverpool to win on the night <BRK>this is a bayern side in transition  beatable given they are without key player and at the same time attempting to reduce the age of the squad  of the xi that started here  only manuel neuer  david alaba and javi martinez were at the club when they won the competition six year ago <BRK>and life under kovac ha not been straightforward a evidenced the fact that they are not   yet   top of the bundesliga  that honour go to borussia dortmund currently although their recent wobble might well open the door to bayern and see them eliminated from the champion league <BRK>they are germany s liverpool this season  the challenger to the team on a higher budget and with the title in their trophy cabinet  bayern are manchester city  looking to recover their swagger once and for all and ease their way to the front <BRK>that is easier said than done  even more so when the team ha played so inconsistently  perhaps that inconsistency ha fed into their champion league performance  they are still bayern munich after all but played conservatively at anfield  always conscious of the threat liverpool could hit with on the counter attack <BRK>they conceded far too many chance in the first half when liverpool could have gone two goal up  their reluctance to come out and play indicating a side terrified of what might happen if they did just that <BRK>but that meant the game wa blunted because liverpool for different reason were doing similar  they have been faultless at home in this competition for the past couple of season but facing a team containing james rodriguez and robert lewandowski naturally a little wary of leaving too many gap in and around fabinho and joel matip <BRK>

<BRK>there wa a sense of nervousness in the way they attempted to play out from the back through a makeshift central defensive partnership  lewandowski  serge gnabry and kingsley coman were close to capitalising at one stage or another <BRK>but bayern did not pursue that away goal a if their life depended on it  and in truth that dulled the contest  neither team wa exactly happy to leave with a share of the spoil but not heartbroken either <BRK>it lead to a strange three week void where nobody is exactly sure where anybody stand  statistic will be wheeled out to show which side is the likelier to progress and in what circumstance  those number would tend to favour bayern  liverpool are rotten on their travel so far this season in europe and there ha been no indication that they are fighting their way out of that three game slump  factor in last season s semi and final and liverpool have lost five outside anfield on the bounce <BRK>but all it take is one chance  one that came in a little a   second against augsburg <BRK>this then wa the kind of game which put uefa s reappraisal of the away goal rule into perspective  there is an annual coach fourm   headed arsene wenger   which in september came to the conclusion that the away goal rule had outlived it purpose <BRK>when it wa established in    the away goal rule came at a time when football wa more or le a different sport  progress in the field of scouting  analysis  travel  logistics and facility mean away trip are no longer what they once were <BRK>back then if a team went away in europe it wa expensive and quite often fruitless  they did not know what kind of opposition team or pitch would be waiting for them and so the default tactic wa duck and cover <BRK>so in time for the   cup winner  cup  uefa decided to incentivise going away and scoring  the establishment of the away goal rule showed team that losing     wa better than losing      over time it led to home team becoming ever more conservative  all the way up to tuesday night <BRK>it wa the archetypal match in the analysis of what the away goal doe and how it affect tie <BRK>the home team playing cagily against a higher seeded away opposition  check <BRK>the higher seeded team playing cagily that goal could well be prospected more easily in the home leg  check <BRK>it s no wonder uefa is looking at abolishing the rule  but we are no more aware of what yet will replace it  what kind of game theory will take hold if away goal no longer  count double   we would appear certain to see more extra time and more penalty <BRK>at the moment we have a situation where the away goal rule is indeed fit for purpose in second leg  that s when one goal can turn defeat into victory or vice versa  those stake are impossible to find anywhere else in the sport  but the counterbalance to that is the knife edge  tentative play in the first leg a we saw on tuesday <BRK>
