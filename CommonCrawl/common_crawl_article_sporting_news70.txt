it s a big weekend for wwe with the royal rumble coming up on sunday  which is one of their biggest show of the year and the launching point for the  road to wrestlemania    <BRK> but the night before will be the latest nxt takeover event in phoenix featuring talent from the nxt brand  who have produced some of the best wrestling show under the wwe umbrella over the past several year  <BRK> saturday night s takeover event feature five match  including tommaso ciampa defending the nxt championship against aleister black  bianca belair challenging shayna baszler for the nxt woman s championship  and roderick strong and kyle o reilly of the undisputed era putting the nxt tag team title on the line against the war raider  plus  ricochet will face johnny gargano for the north american championship while matt riddle square off against kassius ohno  <BRK> join dazn and watch more than   fight night a year <BRK> paul  triple h  levesque is the person in charge of the brand and spoke with the medium about saturday s nxt takeover  phoenix event  talent using social medium in today s world  if all elite wrestling may change the way it doe business  the status of lars sullivan  the chance of nxt getting a television deal  and more  <BRK>   on the recent tweet from velveteen dream where he said   until we  can come   an agreement a   what my worth actually is  there won t be any appearance or performance from  the velveteen dream   <BRK> i have not spoken with him about it  he is a remarkable  young man that it wonderfully gifted on all level and wonderfully gifted about creating buzz around himself a well  calling out vince  mcmahon      it s all good  he creates some buzz and that s a good thing  having the ability to be that smart and that talented at the same time is a wonderful thing  <BRK>   on finding a happy medium with talent when it come to creating buzz on social medium but not overstepping a line  <BRK> i think everybody in the world is trying to figure out the line of social medium  what you can and cannot say  you see people all the time in our industry and everywhere else saying thing and then trying to backtrack it or walk it down  when you write something in however many character you re allowed  it s limiting and can be taken out of context  it s a sensitive subject for everybody   <BRK> clearly  there are parameter of thing that you don t want to touch on  you don t want to offend people and you want to stay a neutral a possible  but i think for u  when it come to the buiness or what we do  it s jut not ruining the magic for fan and keeping them engaged and guessing  and i don t mean that in the way it sound to say  when people say   oh my god  kayfabe is dead   really  you think  <BRK> people want to be engaged in it  they just don t want to have thing given away  you can follow the magician  he doesn t have to show you the trick exactly how it s done  you still know it s magic  you still enjoy it  i think all that stuff is there  i think in the world today  people are just a facinated in the true life human being a they are about the character they portray when they re seen on a television show or anything else  and i think people are also smart enough and savvy enough to know the difference between the two  hype  all those different thing  they can be meaningful tool when done right and pushed in the right direction  it s more guidance than it is anything else with trying to get the right thing done and not have people put their foot in their mouth and saying the wrong thing because it s eay to offend just about anybody nowadays  <BRK>   on why the nxt takeover show and wwe hall of fame swapped day during wrestlemania weekend with takeover now taking place that friday night and the hall of fame on saturday  the ring of honor new japan pro wrestling  g  supercard  event take place that saturday night at madison square garden   <BRK> i think buiness reason for u and  in general  now wanting to make fan choose and not want to make fan have to make a decision of what they want to go to  it wa the better buiness and venue split for u  everybody read into everything and it wa really nothing more than that  it wa the right buiness move for u  <BRK>   on whether all elite wrestling will change anything with wwe nxt including  from a contractual standpoint  having to pay more to get top talent   <BRK> it s clearly something that we ll keep an eye on and clearly something that they re out there doing their buiness but we ll do what is right for our buiness   what s right for wwe  what we feel is right for the fan of the wwe universe  our fan base  everybody in general  and what s right for u  they re all buiness decision and we ll continue to monitor everything   <BRK> we say it all the time but it s the truth  it s not just a competitor like that  we compete against everything  i know you ve heard it said that in the business world today when you re a content provider  you compete against everything including sleep  including the internet  and everything else  everybody ha a thousand pull on their time on a daily business so you want to keep your eye on everything and try to be a relevant a possible at all time on every front  we continue to monitor that like we monitor everything and we ll continue to do what s best for business for the wwe  <BRK>   on the story regarding lars sullivan and his status with the company  a well a his well being following report he wa supposed to debut on the wwe main roster recently but instead left the business following a possible anxiety attack  <BRK> there s a lot of speculation and story about everybody at all time and it s a funny thing  if there s any kind of a glitch  a movement for a moment  that lead to everything being speculated about  lars is in a good place and nothing ha really changed  we re moving forward and you ll know when you see it but nothing ha changed  <BRK> this saturday  don t miss  nxttakeover   phoenix streaming live at  e  p only on the award winning  wwenetwork   pic twitter com oy it hlpg <BRK>   on how the war raider and matt riddle are developing in nxt and insight on other newer talent with the brand  <BRK> when you talk about the war raider  they re coming off of impressive showing at war game  coming off of all the success they ve had and now stepping into the ring for the nxt tag team championship  to me  it s a statement for how well they ve done since they ve come in  matt riddle  he just ha an innate charisma that you can t take your eye off him  he s just one of those guy  i think he ll continue to grow and move forward   <BRK> bianca belair is one that  to me  just all of a sudden came into her own  when you think about it  when we did the first mae young classic  i think that may have been one of her first match that wa televised anywhere or had been done in a big way  there wa a conversation around that going into the first mae young classic about do you think she can do a match  that s a dramatic change to where she is now  shayna baszler  who wa super green  had a little bit of experience but wa super  super green walking in the door is now  to me  one of the steady of the division and continuing to grow and carry it   <BRK> the growth on everybody  to me  is phenomenal  where everybody go and how they transition here  uk  main roster  raw  smackdown  whatever that is  i think they re all groomed in the right way to have success  they re all groomed and have the tool and are positioned to do amazing thing in the future and hopefully  all of them will  and there s a lot coming in behind them from guy like punishment martinez all the way through who are just sitting prime for the door opening up for them and for them to show the world what they do  that  to me  raise the bar because if you re in any position and you see all of these guy and girl with talent coming up behind you  you want to make sure you re moving in the right direction   <BRK>   on what they will be doing with nxt uk during wrestlemania week  <BRK> with all of this  you have thought in mind of where you think you can go but until you take the next step  then you don t know what the step is after that  i think all of that is on the table  there will definitely be involvement from the nxt uk brand at wrestlemania week  we re working through all of that now  i think when you re talking about phoenix this week and even at axxess and doing when world collide and an nxt  nxt uk    live tournament branded around each other  i see a lot of buzz around that  fan are very excited for it  i m excited for it  to be honest with you  there s a lot of great matchup on there i want to see and i want to see how the chemistry work  that s an exciting one to me and putting that together wa fun   <BRK> i think all of that creates an excitement  different brand  different grouping  different talent in different place that can come together at various time and have those fresh  competitive environment that make for exciting event and opportunity  a it move forward  all of those brand will be more and more of every single thing we do but also  especially  wrestlemania week  <BRK>   on how his training and rehab from his torn pectoral muscle injury is coming along  <BRK> good  thanks for aking  i just got cleared to start training  which for anybody who ha ever had a serious injury  the difference between rehabbing for a couple hour a day and actually training is the difference of trying to get better and then actually bettering yourself  i just got clearance for training so i m excited about that  a i sit here right now extremely sore from that training  which wa one week ago that i got cleared  but i m feeling good  <BRK>   on the rock s daughter simone johnson training at the performance center in orlando and insight into her training  <BRK> i think if you want to know about the rock s daughter  the best person to ak would be the rock  she probably  i know  ha the bug of the business  she is caught the love of it from her father  i think that even if you were to ak the rock  there s nothing like that  that electricity and that connection that he ha with people and i think it all stem from his time in wwe  his love of that is evident every time he s around it  i think she see that a well  it s in her blood  i think if it s something she want to pursue  i know that he is big like i am on continuing education and taking the right step and doing everything the right way  i know that he belief that it s a wonderful business that he would be proud to have her be a part of  <BRK> a far a will you see more of her in the future  i think it would be hard to not see her in the future  <BRK>   on seeing move like the canadian destroyer and others more often on wwe and nxt television nowadays that weren t allowed a few year ago and the line of when to ask talent to scale back on some move  <BRK> i think it all come down to safety  talent safety  sometimes i look online and see a plethora of kid that have no training or knowing what they re doing and in a wrestling ring in some little town somewhere and doing a flip and landing on their head or whatever  the danger level is high  we re looking out for the long term health of talent  it all come down to thing that can be performed and performed safely and if we feel there is a risk of it not being performed safely  then we re not going to allow it to happen  they re thoroughbred horse that will run themselves into the ground and we have to protect them from that  what we do is dangerous and it s a very physical business  injury rate   it s just a given  you re not going to do this for a living and not get injured at some point but you need to manage it and we need to be the one to manage it for you and with you   <BRK>   on whether there ha been talk of moving nxt programming to a television outlet such a f   <BRK> i think at this point in time we re concentrated on moving smackdown to fox and what that will mean  there s a lot of talk about a lot of thing  we re constantly evaluating  a far a the fox relationship go  we re thrilled and excited to go there  we re working on what that will look like and the process and everything else  we re focused on that  <BRK>   on the call up process involving nxt uk and if talent there will go to nxt first before being brought up to the main roster  <BRK> i think it will depend on the level of talent and who is ready for what  at the end of the day  everybody that is within this is a part of the wwe  move  switch over  whatever you want to call it  that can happen at any point in time for anybody  it really come down to who is ready for what position and where  you want people to be a prepared a they can be for the transition for raw or smackdown or whatever that move is  you want them to have all of the tool and be positioned to do it right   <BRK> when you watch the show sometime  it s not always evident to see the thing that people need to work on or change to move into a different position  sometime it s behind the scene  sometime it s on camera thing but we want to make sure they re positioned in the right way at all time for the most success possible whenever they move whether that s from uk to nxt or nxt to uk or raw or smackdown   <BRK>
