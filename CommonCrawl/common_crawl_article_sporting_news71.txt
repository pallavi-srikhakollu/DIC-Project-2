amid a host of underwhelming result and a strong current of fan discontent  real madrid s effort to rebuild the squad that ha won four of the last five champion league title continue unabated <BRK>sunday s     victory over betis may not have been overly convincing  but it gave a glimpse into what santiago solari and the real hierarchy hope to achieve at the bernabeu <BRK>european soccer live   in hd on dazn   dazn ca<BRK>youngster like vinicius junior      federico valverde     and sergio reguilon     won start in andalusia  while dani ceballos      cristo gonzalez     and new signing brahim diaz     were summoned from the bench <BRK>the game offered further evidence of real s determination to rejuvenate a squad that ha been looking jaded after four champion league triumph over the last five year <BRK>the overhaul show no sign of slowing down either  on the contrary  the revolution could be ramped up with the addition of eder militao  the porto defender winning rave review in his first season in europe <BRK>militao is just   and could have been forgiven for needing time to settle in to the rigour of life across the atlantic ocean following the completion of his move from sao paulo in the summer of   <BRK>however  the centre back s adaptation ha been almost instantaneous  he ha missed just three of his side s liga no fixture to date a porto have built up a commanding lead at the top of the table <BRK>a mobile right back during his first professional season in brazil  militao ha been shifted into the centre since moving to portugal due to the presence of the irrepressible maxi pereira out wide <BRK>however  in the middle he ha struck up a formidable partnership with fellow brazilian felipe in front of iker casillas  marshalling a defence that ha conceded just   goal in   league game and also sent porto through to the champion league knockout stage unbeaten in group d <BRK>

<BRK>moreover  the mobility and attacking flair vital for any brazilian full back ha remained with militao during his conversion  he ha no qualm whatsoever about bringing the ball out from the back  albeit occasionally setting porto fan on edge with his extravagant dribbling under pressure <BRK>there are sign too that he is beginning to rein in his rather enthusiastic tackling  having received no le than six yellow card in   serie a outing for sao paulo in    he is yet to be shown a booking in primeira liga play <BRK>militao is obviously a raw talent  still learning his trade  but having cost just    million      m     m   his next transfer is likely to generate ten time that amount <BRK>madrid are short on depth in defence and  therefore  keen to add militao to their rank a early a the current window  they are not his only admirer  though <BRK>manchester united sent scout to watch him in action during porto s     win over nacional last monday  while liverpool have also been linked <BRK>the defender s     m      m     m  release clause is certainly accessible to europe s elite  and a transfer seems a question of when  rather than if at this point <BRK>

<BRK>the arrival of veteran pepe at the dragao could be read a porto attempting to cover any potential exit  although attempt are being made to persuade militao to sign a new deal prior to his departure  so a to allow his current employer to increae the size of his buy out clause <BRK>nonetheless  a meeting between porto and madrid   who enjoy excellent relation thanks to year of close cooperation on transfer over the year   is expected before the january window slam shut and even if militao stay put this winter  he will almost certainly be the subject of further overture come june <BRK>militao remains an unknown quantity and would arguably benefit more from a further season at porto than jumping head first into the notoriously demanding santiago bernabeu bear pit <BRK>but no matter what happens this january with madrid  one thing is clear  this young defender ha what it take to make it at the top  and sooner or later will be starring for the blancos or another of europe s top team <BRK>
