the excitement surrounding the first opportunity to see a full strength u s  national team play for gregg berhalter faded quickly with the sight of weston mckennie being carried off on a stretcher against ecuador on thursday  the illusion of being able to see what a usmnt gold cup lineup might look like wa replaced instead the reminder that there are plenty of job still to be fought for  and several player still waiting for their chance to show berhalter they deserve a bigger role  <BRK> which brings u to tuesday s friendly against chile  the game will be the last chance for player to impress berhalter before the head coach put together a gold cup team in late may  there will be two month between now and then  and berhalter ha made it clear that club form is important in his evaluation  but the player currently in camp have to believe that a strong showing against chile can only serve to boost their chance of securing a place on that gold cup squad  <BRK> berhalter ha made it clear he plan on shaking up his lineup for tuesday s friendly  and with mckennie and tyler adam already gone  that mean at leat two starting spot will be available  berhalter let adam return to rb leipzig after having seen him look very sharp against ecuador  and some other top starter will likely be rested on tuesday a well  john brook look like a prime candidate to sit against chile  a doe tim ream  though christian pulisic should start considering his recent struggle for regular minute with borussia dortmund  <BRK> given who will be missing  and who stand a good chance of being rested  here are five player who have a lot to gain performing well on tuesday against chile  <BRK>

 <BRK> when adam  departure from camp wa revealed  the initial reaction wa that it might mean a chance to see yedlin at right back against chile  but given berhalter s comment earlier in camp about wanting to see yedlin in a wide midfield role  it feel more likely the newcatle defender will be deployed a a winger against chile  <BRK> enter nick lima  one of the standouts of the january camp  and a player who looked extremely comfortable in the hybrid right back defensive midfield role berhalter ha created for his system  lima han t enjoyed the best start to his ml regular season  having started but been removed from the game in all three match under new san jose head coach matias almeyda  <BRK> if lima get the starting nod against chile  he could solidify his place a the number two option at the position behind adam  but if he struggle  then it could lead berhalter to look at other right back option a the gold cup draw closer  <BRK>

 <BRK> a year ago matt miazga looked like a much of a sure bet to be starting at the   gold cup a any defender  that wa before a failed loan stint at french club nantes set him back  a move that happened just a new york red bull defender aaron long wa positioning himself a a viable usmnt option  <BRK> miazga ha rebounded with a successful stint with championship side reading  but he ha fallen behind long on the usmnt depth chart  long wore the captain s armband for the january camp friendly  and more recently turned in a strong shift against ecuador  <BRK> if berhalter rest brook  then we could see a long miazga pairing at center back  which would not only allow berhalter to do a side by side comparison of the two player vying to start next to brook  but also let him see a potential pairing he could turn to if brook add to his history of injury  <BRK>

 <BRK> mckennie s injury mean there won t be another chance this month to see him and pulisic in the dual   role in berhalter s midfield  but it doe mean the manager will have a chance to partner pulisic with cristian roldan  who is also well suited to complement the borussia dortmund star in the middle of the field  roldan ha the two way ability to fit into the right sided number   role  <BRK> roldan looked solid in his second half cameo against ecuador  though he came into the match after pulisic had already been replaced sebastian lletget  berhalter will want to see better attacking contribution from roldan  who had a very good showing in the january camp   <BRK> berhalter could also look at roldan in the deeper number six role  especially if wil trapp is still recovering from the knock he suffered against ecuador and berhalter decides not to give michael bradley a full   minute  roldan is playing in a defensive midfield role for the seattle sounder in    and ha the quality to be an effective deep lying midfield option for berhalter  <BRK>

 <BRK> a we watched adam settle into the right back role and show well versus ecuador  it wa difficult not to wonder what that might mean for deandre yedlin  who ha gone from being the team s lock starter at right back to a player who doesn t have a guaranteed role  even though he s one of just two american  tim ream being the other  currently playing regularly in the english premier league  <BRK> yedlin should be in the starting lineup against chile  and it is very likely he will be deployed a a right winger  why not play him a a right back with adam having returned to germany  berhalter see him a a better fit on the wing than in the hybrid right back defensive midfielder role  which requires the kind of positional awareness and pasing ability yedlin doesn t have in central midfield  <BRK> working in yedlin s favor is the reality that the number of in form wing option in the usmnt player pool isn t exactly large  jordan morris struggled against ecuador  while paul arriola ha seen more look on the left wing  even though he s a natural right winger  if yedlin struggle to make an impact a a right winger against chile  he could fall further away from a starting role at the gold cup  <BRK>

 <BRK> one of the bigger surprise of the usmnt lineup against ecuador wa ethan horvath being on the bench in favor of sean johnson  that isn t a knock on johnson  who ha been in good form with new york city fc  but rather an acknowledgment of the excellent form horvath ha enjoyed with club brugge  <BRK> johnson didn t have much to do against ecuador  which failed to produce a single shot on goal  but it would be difficult to see berhalter not give horvath at leat one start  he won t have a solid a defense in front of him a johnson had lat thursday  which might wind up presenting him with more opportunity to show what he can do in berhalter s system   <BRK> with zack steffen the favorite to start at the gold cup  horvath can t afford a shaky outing if he s going to remain the clear leading candidate to back up the future manchester city man  <BRK>
