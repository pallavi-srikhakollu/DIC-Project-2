prayers do get answered  at least that s the case for jeremy lamb  the charlotte hornets guard who beat the raptors with a hail mary heave from half court  <BRK> lamb lost control of the ball with the clock running down and the hornets down two  by the time he gathered it  he was a foot behind the half court line  lamb launched a high arcing bomb all the way from mid court  somehow  it hit the glass and went in  <BRK> we  have  no  words   jeremy lamb with the half court buzzer beater to win  the  game       hornets   tissot pic twitter com vounxmhzcv <BRK> a few things here  if i may   <BRK> one  kemba walker had no faith in that shot going in  once it left lamb s hands  walker turned his back to the play almost in disgust  to be honest  kemba  i had no faith in that shot going in  either   <BRK> two  look at lamb s reaction to the shot dropping  <BRK> the guy looks like a kicker who just iced a game on a point after attempt  <BRK> then look at how he talks that talk after his teammates get to him  <BRK> that s a whole   mood  to be honest  <BRK> this game doesn t have much bearing on playoff standings  the hornets are probably still going to be on the outside looking in  and the raptors will be the two seed  straight like that  <BRK> had that half court heave not gone in  we would have been taking about kemba walker  who just can t seem to catch a break or get the help he needs to make a deep playoff run  but today  charlotte s prayers were answered  hail mary  the lord is with thee  <BRK>
