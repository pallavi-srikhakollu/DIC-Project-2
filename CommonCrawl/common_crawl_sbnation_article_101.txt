if you ve gone anywhere near espn in the past couple weeks  you ve seen what this year s ncaa women s basketball tournament has to live up to  arike ogunbowale s two consecutive buzzer beaters to bring notre dame the national championship  the truly mad conclusion to   s big dance  <BRK> it s going to be tough to top  but if there were ever a field set up for a jaw dropping finish it s this year s highest seeds  there hasn t been a clear front runner all season long  and that s true entering the tournament as well  uconn s reign as a women s college basketball powerhouse is far from over  but they haven t won a title since   and are coming into the tournament with an uncharacteristic two regular season losses  in their place  six other deep and talented teams have been battling all season long with an offensive  frequent   point plus games  and defensive intensity that s been thrilling to watch   and should only escalate going into the tournament   <BRK> without further ado  here are seven teams who will certainly be dancing deep into the tournament   and have a great shot at winning the chip   <BRK> it s hard to find a weakness in the tournament s no    overall seed  but their strength is straightforward  defense  with     kalani brown and     lauren cox in the paint  cox alone has a     percent block rate   the lady bears are the no    team in the country for defensive rebounds and blocks  add to that the team s ability to feed their towers of power  credit holly rowe  for easy layups  their deep bench  and the fact they had one loss all season  and you re looking at a squad that makes an all chalk bracket look wise  <BRK> obviously  you can t count out uconn  yes  they re playing with a relatively shallow bench  and one of their stars  katie lou samuelson  was injured in the last week of the regular season  but by all accounts she s back in action  and now   thanks to a somewhat surprising no    seed from the selection committee   they re playing with a chip on their shoulder that should  frankly  terrify any opponent  napheesa collier is one of the top players in the country  and has been averaging a very casual double double  normally  uconn is coasting on gaudy stats and unforgiving wins  this year  they re relying on pure grit   which might actually be scarier   <BRK> the fighting irish have a very real chance to defend their title this year  given that the core of their championship team   ogunbowale  jessica shepard  jackie young  and marina mabrey   remains intact  and they got back relentless defender brianna turner after an acl tear  all five of their starters are averaging double digit points   the truth is  the team is actually better than they were last year     when they won the whole thing  they re entering the tournament off a commanding defeat of conference rival louisville for the acc title  and it seems unlikely that anyone will be able to stop them from steam rolling their way into the final four and quite possibly the title game   <BRK> the bulldogs have been a little bit outside of the spotlight this year after dominating an uncharacteristically weak sec over the course of the regular season and conference tournament   but after two tantalizingly close misses in a row at an ncaa title  they re more ready than ever to make a deep run in the tournament  they did lose all around star victoria vivians  but they still have nearly impenetrable post player teaira mccowan  who only failed to get a double double four times this season  she s surrounded by a slew of ultra quick guards who can rack up the points in transition  including jazzmun holmes and jordan danberry  and dogged rebounder and scorer anriel howard  losing chloe bibby hurt them  but andra espinoza hunter and bre amber scott have helped fill the void she left with clutch three point shooting   <BRK> after getting the program s first ever no    overall ranking  the ducks hit a rough patch late in the season and lost the pac   title in a stunner to stanford  resulting in a no    seed in the ncaa tournament  they re not likely to go down easy  though  especially not to  possibly  a mississippi state team they beat earlier in the season  sabrina ionescu is a defender s nightmare  given her record setting ability to score  distribute the ball  and rebound  it s not at all out of the question that she ll get a triple double at some point during the tournament   she has ruthy hebard  the no    most efficient scorer in the country  her effective field goal percentage is     percent   holding things down in the post and a backcourt of dangerous three point shooters   <BRK> the cardinals were hammered by injuries to their starters arica carter and sam fuerhing during the acc tournament  but both are on track to return for the big dance  though the team might not be operating at full strength  they still have asia durr   one of the college game s most dangerous scorers  and a soon to be top   wnba draft pick   running the show  she had   points against a top   team in the last game of the regular season  and if that version of durr shows up to the tournament  there s no telling how far louisville can go   <BRK> realistically  the no    seed hawkeyes shouldn t be on this list  they re in a weaker conference  with a less impressive cast  and an unimpressive six losses  but i absolutely refuse to be the person who goes on the record counting out the country s leading scorer    ppg  and second most efficient scorer      percent efg   megan gustafson  <BRK>
