with three weeks left in the nba regular season  there s not much left to settle  the west playoff roster is effectively set  and the east bracket s top five teams are basically locked into their seeds  the bucks will finish with the no    overall record  the worst teams are obvious  and the only real playoff race remaining involves teams under     <BRK> that said  here s what remains to be decided  <BRK>   home court advantage in the celtics pacers series in the first round  <BRK>   the       seeds in the east are unstable  and in theory any of the nets  pistons  and heat could be caught by the chasing magic      out of no     or hornets      out of no        thinks the pistons and nets have really strong chances of holding on  but the heat might be in danger to the magic  one game back   <BRK>   the no    seed in the west  the warriors lead denver by a half game  similarly  the rockets and blazers are still fighting over the no    seed  which probably means avoiding golden state until the west finals  <BRK>   the nos      seeds in the west could go in any order between the clippers  thunder  jazz  and spurs  it might be wide open until the last two or three days of the season  all will make the playoffs  but one of them is going to get saddled with the warriors in round    <BRK>   the third worst record in the nba  this is a big one  the knicks and suns have basically locked in two of the three worst records in the nba  which means a   percent shot at the no    pick each  cleveland is in position for the third worst record  but the cavaliers are only two games worse than bulls  don t get cute  cleveland  finish weak  <BRK>   two picks are at stakes in the middle of the lottery pack  the mavericks are currently the sixth worst team in the nba  and the hawks nab their pick if it s outside the top five  the lottery will determine what happens there  but the grizzlies lose their pick to the celtics if it s outside the top eight  and memphis could bolster their chances by losing  they could still realistically finish anywhere from sixth to ninth worst  <BRK>   and finally  the nba has had at least one team win at least   games every non lockout season since    the bucks need to go     or better to get there  but there s more incentive to rest than to close strong  so we ll see  <BRK> nba news and links delivered to your inbox each weekday  so you never miss out  <BRK> clippers    knicks  cavaliers    bucks  nuggets    pacers  hornets    raptors  rockets    pelicans  spurs    celtics  pistons    warriors  kings    lakers   <BRK> all times eastern  games on league pass unless otherwise noted  <BRK> sixers at magic     nba tvthunder at grizzlies   suns at jazz   nets at blazers     nba tv <BRK> paul flannery s sunday shootaround is on the nuggets  who have become the nba s anachronistic contender  check it out  <BRK> jeremy lamb hit an  incredible  halfcourt heave at the buzzer to beat the raptors on sunday  that followed a pretty nice comeback for the hornets on saturday against the celtics  somehow  those two wins keep charlotte with the most tenuous chance of still making the playoffs in the east  just three behind miami  two plus a tiebreaker    <BRK> james harden dropped   on the spurs on friday  there is a very strong case for him to repeat as mvp  <BRK> the celtics are on another slide  but don t seem to be a mess like they have been before  boston could still take the no    seed from indiana if they get out of their own way  but the top five in the east is otherwise firm and we re almost assuredly getting a celtics pacers first round series   <BRK> the lakers were officially eliminated from playoff contention on friday  i wrote about how la found new contours of the limits of lebron james  powers  <BRK> welp  it looks like thanks to an alleged crook robbing lonzo ball from the inside  big baller brand might be dead  <BRK> your regularly updated zion williamson highlight tracker  we almost lost him for the tournament on sunday  <BRK> murray state is out of the tournament  but jonathan tjarks writes that ja morant s nba future was revealed in those two games  <BRK> folks  the hawks are good  <BRK> and finally  all hail tani  kid should be a household name  <BRK> be excellent to each other  <BRK>
