are jon gruden and mike mayock quickly putting together a pretty decent roster for the oakland raiders  it s starting to look like it  for the most part  <BRK> quarterback derek carr is  at the least  solid and serviceable  his wide receiver group is vastly upgraded with the addition of antonio brown and tyrell williams  the team spent big on left tackle trent brown and  theoretically    first round tackle kolton miller will get better in his second season  on defense  the raiders still have holes  but they ve added a few starters in free agency  <BRK> that takes the raiders to the   nfl draft  where gruden and mayock can continue the rebuild  helping that cause is having four of the first   picks  that many high picks could lead the raiders to taking a risk on a big upside player with one of them  <BRK> don t worry  this mock draft isn t all about the raiders  this week s mock examines the first two rounds of the draft  the top five is mixed up a little this time  three tight ends go in the first round  there s a run on wide receivers in the second round  and seemingly half the nfl gets a new starting defensive lineman  basically  there s something for everybody   <BRK> offseason needs  interior defensive line  wide receiver  tight end  slot cornerback <BRK> in a recent nfl network interview  cardinals head coach kliff kingsbury did all he could to not tip his hand about what the team will do with the first overall pick   <BRK>  when you have that first pick  you ve gotta turn over every stone and look at every scenario that s out there  and so we re definitely doing that   kingsbury said while also giving a lukewarm response about starting quarterback josh rosen  <BRK> something in arizona is going to get awkward  whether it s trading rosen  keeping him as a backup  or us all being fooled about murray at no     <BRK> offseason needs  safety  edge defender  wide receiver  cornerback <BRK> not another defensive tackle for the  ers how could you   the sentiment is understandable given the drafting of arik armstead  deforest buckner  and solomon thomas in consecutive years  however  if thomas is used more on the outside this season  that opens up a spot next to buckner  armstead is  for all intents  a lost cause   a starting defensive line of dee ford  buckner  williams  and thomas would be quite potent  <BRK> besides  how can you pass up a player after sharing pancakes with him   <BRK> offseason needs  offensive tackle  edge defender  cornerback  center <BRK> although the jets are staying in more of a     base defense  they won t be able to say no to bosa if he s there at no     the team just doesn t have a pass rusher who can do what bosa can  he can play lined up at end  or he can be a standup rusher at the edge  bosa has just about every trait you want in a pass rusher  he s powerful and quick and has excellent handwork  his size is fine  and he s fully recovered from a core injury suffered last season  no player is a can t miss prospect  but bosa is close  <BRK> offseason needs  edge defender  cornerback  running back  linebacker <BRK> a mixup in the top five with williams going second overall would benefit the raiders if they covet allen  they probably perceive him as being a   to   replacement for khalil mack  that s the player allen compares himself to  at least  the raiders can bookend arden key with allen  giving them a pair of athletic edge players on a defensive line that s starting to take shape after free agency  <BRK> offseason needs  safety  edge defender  linebacker  offensive line <BRK> sure  the buccaneers added deone bucannon in free agency  but he hasn t been a very productive player since the   season  with kwon alexander gone  the buccaneers need talent at linebacker  white is a player with few flaws  especially when he can work in space and locate the football  he s a strong tackler and has outstanding instincts   <BRK> offseason needs  quarterback  offensive tackle  linebacker  edge rusher <BRK> the giants were all over haskins last week  first  they took him out to dinner the night before his pro day  and head coach pat shurmur spent time with haskins after his throwing session ended  that report about the giants not being interested in haskins is looking less realistic as the draft approaches  <BRK> offseason needs  offensive tackle  tight end  safety  guard <BRK> if you take the stance that jacksonville s offensive line is decent enough  and it sort of is  that opens up what the jaguars can do at no     they could add another high level piece to a talented defense  don t forget  jacksonville had the nfl s best defense in   according to dvoa  or the jags could find a reliable player on offense in hockenson  the value of taking a tight end at seven can be argued  but hockenson makes an impact on the whole offense  <BRK> offseason needs  tight end  linebacker  guard  wide receiver  defensive end <BRK> detroit may have added trey flowers in free agency  but the team needed more than just one edge player this offseason  sweat can be a terror off the edge  and in just two seasons at mississippi state he had   sacks  if sweat can get a little stronger and play the run better  he will easily warrant a top   pick  <BRK> offseason needs  defensive tackle  cornerback  tight end  offensive tackle <BRK> oliver to the bills seems to be a perfect match  the bills need players on the defensive line who can create pressure  and that is oliver s specialty  oliver may not be the biggest lineman  or a block occupier against the run  but he doesn t need to be with harrison phillips next to him   <BRK> offseason needs  linebacker  tight end  cornerback  guard <BRK> there s still some discussion about a quarterback for the broncos at no     but it just doesn t make sense after trading for joe flacco  taking a quarterback who will more than likely sit at least a year should be a second or third day of the draft move  northwestern s clayton thorson  a day   player  could fit what offensive coordinator rich scangarello wants in the position  for instance  <BRK> bush would give the broncos a speedy linebacker who can make plays all over the field   <BRK> offseason needs  linebacker  tight end  quarterback  offensive tackle <BRK> with the top two linebackers gone  the bengals are in a tricky spot at no     metcalf would be cincinnati s third first round wide receiver pick since    a j  green  the team s   first round pick  is a free agent after the season  john ross  the team s   first round pick  hasn t produced and was part of trade rumors this offseason  with players at bigger positions of need gone  the bengals could gamble on metcalf s upside   <BRK> offseason needs  tight end  guard  defensive line  right tackle <BRK> green bay is a challenging team to figure out high in the first round  it s easy to see the team s holes  but the packers have players in each of them already  at tight end  they have jimmy graham and marcedes lewis  at right tackle  bryan bulaga still has a year left on his contract  the same can be said about mike daniels on the defensive line  if they draft based purely with the best player available philosophy  gary could be in play  he could push dean lowry for a starting spot  and ensure the packers have a difference maker up front if daniels leaves next offseason  <BRK> offseason needs  quarterback  offensive tackle  edge defender  defensive tackle <BRK> robert quinn has been disappointing the past couple of seasons  and it looks like he ll be traded  that would leave the rebuilding dolphins with few quality edge rushers on the roster  ferrell might not have the upside of florida state s brian burns  but he may be a safer pick  <BRK> offseason needs  defensive tackle  cornerback  tight end <BRK> maybe it s getting a little boring to send defensive tackles to atlanta in mock drafts  but this explains why the line needs some work  in four years at clemson  wilkins had   tackles and   tackles for loss  he can bring plenty of pressure up the middle too  according to sports info solutions  rookie handbook  wilkins created   pressures and   hurries  much better numbers than williams  oliver  or mississippi state s jeffery simmons  <BRK> offseason needs  left guard  wide receiver  edge rusher  offensive tackle <BRK> lock is one of hardest players to not only evaluate  but also find a good spot for in the draft  on the surface  he s a highly talented thrower with a strong arm  good enough mobility  and a magnetic personality  but when you dig just a little  you see an erratic quarterback with average accuracy and relatively small hands  his opinion is all over the place in the nfl  and that s what makes his draft slot so hard to pin  <BRK> offseason needs  edge defender  offensive tackle  safety  guard <BRK> a pass rusher has been the popular choice for carolina in the first round  but if an offensive tackle as good as williams drops to no     he would be hard to overlook  he s a powerful run blocker who will drive defenders backward  in the passing game  his smooth technique more than makes up for any concern about his length  <BRK> from the top   free agents  to mock drafts  to scouting reports  we ve got everything you need to get through the offseason  all in one place  <BRK> offseason needs  quarterback  offensive tackle  linebacker  edge rusher <BRK> after trading olivier vernon  the giants are in need of a pass rusher or two this offseason  burns is a nimble pass rusher who likes to beat blockers with speed more than power  he has the agility to get low around the edge and closes out space in a hurry  he s not the best run stopper  but the giants need a player who can get after the quarterback  <BRK> offseason needs  guard  defensive tackle  tight end  offensive tackle <BRK> the vikings need help along the offensive line  although taylor played tackle at florida  his playing style could put him in the mix at guard if a team wants to shift him to the interior  that would give the vikings some options up front  <BRK> offseason needs  guard  tight end  nose tackle  edge defender <BRK> when the season starts  stalwart tight end delanie walker will be   and coming off a dislocated and fractured ankle  in a talent rich tight end draft  fant could be in play at no     he can work the middle of the field   which the titans need with marcus mariota at quarterback   and he can line up out wide  <BRK> offseason needs  cornerback  tight end  safety  wide receiver <BRK> the steelers dumped antonio brown this offseason and he could be replaced by his cousin  marquise brown is one of the most electrifying players in the draft this year and can score just about any time he touches the ball  if the steelers have doubts about james washington stepping up as the no    receiver after juju smith schuster  a pass catcher in the first round is plausible  <BRK> offseason needs  defensive line  guard  safety  wide receiver  <BRK> the departure of earl thomas officially closes out the legion of boom era in seattle  if the seahawks are looking to find a player with a similar profile  adderley is the player  he is very good at tracking the ball and had   career interceptions and   pass breakups  he s also not hesitant to get physical near the line of scrimmage  <BRK> offseason needs  edge rusher  wide receiver  linebacker <BRK> terrell suggs is no longer a raven  so the team could be looking early in the draft for his replacement  in the nfl  polite could be more of a standup edge rusher than a defensive end  polite has a rapid first step   his greatest strength   and is good in pursuit  he has work to do as a run defender  but he should find success early in his career as a sack artist  <BRK> offseason needs  offensive tackle  cornerback  defensive line  tight end <BRK> what dillard may lack in power run blocking  he more than makes up in pass blocking  picking in the  s  it can be hard to find a complete offensive tackle  in that case  it s best to find one who can be elite at one thing  for dillard  that s pass blocking  as evidenced in the fact that he only gave up one sack last season  <BRK> offseason needs  edge defender  cornerback  running back  linebacker <BRK> although jacobs has been mocked to the raiders at no    before  they may need to take him before the eagles pick  a discussion about the value of a first round running back can be had  just don t forget that a running back has been taken in the first round in each of the past four years   <BRK> offseason needs  safety  offensive tackle  running back  defensive line <BRK> if adderley were still available  he d be the easy choice for the eagles  with him gone  the safety value at no    is questionable  deionte thompson of alabama seems to be more in the second round territory  and chauncey gardner johnson is more of a nickel corner  tillery can provide the eagles with good depth up front and can line up everywhere down the line  <BRK> offseason needs  defensive end  cornerback  wide receiver  defensive tackle <BRK> the colts added justin houston  so they may not look for a pass rusher here unless one of the top players slips  instead  they could add talent to the secondary with murphy  he only played two seasons at washington  but he has excellent instincts and toughness for the position  <BRK> offseason needs  edge defender  cornerback  running back  linebacker <BRK> if the raiders don t take a cornerback at no     there will still be plenty of good ones at no     williams has outstanding length for a cornerback and he knows how to stick on the hips of a receiver  if he can bulk up some and play more physically  he can end up being one of the best players in this draft  <BRK> offseason needs  offensive tackle  defensive tackle  linebacker  quarterback <BRK> this is a repeat from last week s mock draft because the fit is perfect  ford is a big bodied right tackle who moves defenders around with ease  especially when he gets low run blocking  he can be a little upright at times  but to this point that hasn t hurt him too much  <BRK> offseason needs  edge rusher  cornerback  defensive tackle  center <BRK> steve spagnuolo s defenses have often gotten a strong pass rush from the edges  but without dee ford and justin houston  the chiefs are relying on tanoh kpassagnon  alex okafor  and breeland speaks to have breakout seasons  that s a risky gamble  someone like ferguson  while not a spectacular athlete  is a steady player who should push for a spot in the starting lineup  <BRK> offseason needs  tight end  guard  defensive line <BRK> did you really think we d get out of green bay s two first round picks without a tight end  smith isn t a massive athlete like fant  and he doesn t have as high of a ceiling as hockenson  but smith knows how to make big plays  especially when he s working routes over the middle  as a blocker  he s decent   <BRK> offseason needs  linebacker  guard  cornerback  defensive line <BRK> although some want the rams to trade back and accumulate some extra draft capital  there will be some starter level players available at no     one of them is lawrence  who could occupy the space ndamukong suh is vacating  lawrence is a massive player at   pounds  but in the past he showed some ability as a pass rusher  <BRK> offseason needs  edge defender  tight end  defensive tackle  wide receiver <BRK> if the patriots want to find a replacement for rob gronkowski  it will be difficult in the first round  one of the team s two picks in the second round could suffice  though   <BRK> cornerback isn t new england s biggest need  but baker would be a steal at no     jason mccourty will be   at the start of next season  and the patriots could find his replacement in baker  he s capable in man and zone coverage and seems to like coming up to play the run  <BRK>    arizona cardinals  greg little  ot  ole miss
