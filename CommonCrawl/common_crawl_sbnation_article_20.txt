last february  while preparing for the biggest day of his life  kyle guy thought he had anticipated everything  <BRK> he d enlisted uva athletics photographer matt riley to serve as documentarian  visiting the  boar s head resort in charlottesville together a few days prior to scout the best angle for pictures  he d chosen the location  a small footbridge adjacent to the birdwood golf course clubhouse  before asking his virginia basketball teammates to watch from behind the clubhouse s tinted windows  and he d arranged a decoy  his head coach  tony bennett  who  along with his wife  laurel  had requested a supposed brunch double date  <BRK> with all the details in place  guy  now a   year old junior guard for the cavaliers  felt confident that his marriage proposal to long time girlfriend alexa jenkins would go according to plan  <BRK> and aside from his own jitters and verbal miscues  the morning unfolded as he d hoped  jenkins said yes  the newly engaged couple posed for photos  and they celebrated afterward with close friends and guy s teammates before calling their respective families in indiana   <BRK> the one factor guy hadn t expected was the collective media swarm   <BRK> the next day  the engagement was headline news on local tv channels  regional newspapers  the washington post  and even espn aired photo footage of guy  kneeling before jenkins  mid proposal  <BRK>  i m very used to people having insight on my basketball life and career   but my personal life  unless i put it on social media  is very personal   guy said in a youtube video recap  several months after the proposal   so  when we got engaged  i didn t think it d be nationally televised   <BRK> but perhaps uva s starting shooting guard should ve anticipated the collective interest in his story  which would only magnify a month later   <BRK> on march       the nation watched  stunned  as uva s de andre hunter  his right arm wrapped around guy s shoulders  escorted his teammate off the court post defeat  guy s face buried in his jersey  blocking out the cameramen  the fans   the entire world  and just over a month after top ranked uva s loss to   seeded umbc   the first time in ncaa tournament history that a one seed had lost in the first round   guy posted two lengthy posts to his facebook page  the first was a letter to himself that he had written just after virginia secured the no    overall seed  and the second  a follow up written approximately six weeks later detailing his embarrassment and mental struggles following the upset  <BRK> through the posts  guy offered a detailed look at the turmoil and anxiety he d experienced throughout the season while helping lead his team to five consecutive weeks as the country s no    ranked squad heading into the postseason  as well as acc regular season and conference tournament titles   <BRK> externally  the        pound guy  with his wide smile  buzz haircut  and fair  freckled skin looked at ease  content  but internally  his emotional steadfastness was crumbling  and the death threats following the umbc loss didn t help  <BRK> guy wrote the posts as both offering and explanation  when he hit publish  he felt nervous  college athletes  particularly star players at nationally ranked programs  rarely discuss or show how the attention  pressure  and scrutiny affect them  <BRK>  playing basketball  you never get a second of privacy   guy says   you ve always got eyes on you  people are always saying something  negative or positive  you can say you don t listen to it  but everyone does   <BRK> for guy  the process of learning to withstand the aftershock of last year s abrupt ending reveals much of what elite college athletes often endure  in an era of     digital surveillance exacerbated by social media  fans invest themselves in athletes more directly than ever  and when those athletes falter  publicly or privately  they are beholden to more than themselves and their teammates  <BRK> guy lives that reality each day  but this season   unlike the last   he feels prepared to face it  <BRK> guy grew up a basketball junkie in indianapolis  his father joe played football  and guy wanted to follow suit  but an eighth grade back injury forced him out of the contact sport  he ran the mile in     and considered track  but at    he received his first collegiate basketball scholarship offer  to the university of indianapolis   my stepdad and my dad were like   holy s  t  he s real    guy says  laughing   <BRK> guy also met alexa jenkins that year  he had traveled with his cousin  cody jacob  to a local basketball game  where jenkins  who was already friends with jacob  was watching her brother play  afterward  she texted jacob and said she thought guy was  cute   they first flirted on social media when guy tweeted that he liked eminem and jenkins tweeted back an eminem lyric  they exchanged numbers and started dating soon afterward  <BRK> an undersized  skinny player  guy thrived in response to critics who speculated about his size and ability  he has always played  he says  with the classic  chip on his shoulder   but in high school  his smaller frame didn t matter   he was still the best player on the court   he doesn t just play basketball  he knows basketball   says al goodwin  guy s junior and senior year coach at lawrence central high school  <BRK> guy was also a self confessed people pleaser  goodwin often chided guy for passing the ball too often instead of taking his own shot  a characteristic that continued away from the court  guy has a large family   four parents  five siblings  many cousins   and there was always a backyard bbq to attend  a game to cheer  a concert to watch  <BRK>  i was running   mph at all times in high school   i just never said  no   because i didn t want to let anyone down   guy says    <BRK> his days were a blur of activity    a m  workouts  school  basketball  training  friends  family  dates with jenkins  he d fall asleep after midnight and wake up fewer than five hours later to do it again  with commitments pulling him in all directions  guy had one place he felt at ease  <BRK>  basketball used to be his space where the rest got left behind   jenkins says   he loved that when he was on the court  the outside world couldn t come in   <BRK> guy set numerous goals for himself  mr  indiana basketball  check  mcdonald s all american  check  playing in a high school state championship game  check   i am incredibly driven   if i put my mind to something  no one s going to stop me   he says  <BRK> the mounting pressure he placed on himself was as high as the expectations he assumed that everyone had for him  as is often the case with division i athletes  and that was when his anxiety started to take hold  <BRK> arriving in charlottesville in    guy joined a talented bennett led squad  during his freshman year  he started seven games and appeared in all     <BRK>  he had a relentless attitude   teammate jack salt says   it s hard going against the older guys when you first get here  but i could sense the confidence about him  offensively and defensively    <BRK> guy s move into the college basketball spotlight began during his sophomore season  both for his offensive firepower and for his hair  he maintained his signature man bun throughout the year  earning the coiffure its own twitter handle   kgmanbun  now kyle guy s buzz cut   before cutting it off in mid june of    <BRK> entering last season  the cavaliers weren t ranked among the top   teams in preseason polls  and pundits predicted they d finish sixth in the acc  but by mid february  uva had obtained the nation s no    ranking   the first time for a cavaliers men s basketball team since    guy maintained a   game streak of notching at least one three pointer per contest  and he often led the team in scoring   <BRK>  the first time i came  to charlottesville  and saw how fanatic everyone was about virginia basketball  i thought  this is so scary  i could never do it   says jenkins  a former track athlete   i don t think he was expecting that much attention and pressure    <BRK> as virginia continued to defy expectations  that pressure grew  in the middle of practice one afternoon  guy abruptly broke down  crying  he didn t know why  and he didn t talk to his teammates about it  coach bennett texted guy to let him know that he was praying for him  and to reach out if he needed him  former teammate isaiah wilkins  who spoke last year with espn about his struggles with anxiety and depression  says that guy didn t talk much about his experience   i was kind of sad to see he d been going through that the whole season   wilkins says  <BRK> guy is  the type of person who likes to fight and fix it on his own   jenkins says  but he shared his struggles with her  she asked how long he d felt this way and if he d talked to anyone  particularly his family  he said no   he didn t want them to worry   <BRK>  they d always seen me as a strong kid who s happy   guy says   my mom would ve bawled if she knew i was unhappy   <BRK> instead  guy began meeting each week with dr  jason freeman  one of two staff sports psychologists with virginia athletics  at the recommendation of freeman and the team doctor  guy began taking an anti anxiety medication  he didn t have a specific diagnosis  rather  he felt the constant  heightened stress and anxiety of being a star player on the nation s top ranked team   <BRK>  i tend to feel responsible for everything  in basketball and in life   guy says   there s always someone saying something on twitter  or an interview   i never get a chance to breathe   <BRK> following its defeat of notre dame on march    uva became acc regular season champions and the first team in acc history to win   conference games  a week later  the cavaliers won the acc tournament  in the title game  guy led the wahoos with   points and was voted the tournament mvp   <BRK> on the eve of the ncaa tournament      percent of brackets submitted to cbs sports had selected uva as national champions  more title nods than any other team in the big dance   <BRK>  i m a very real person  but i m not very realistic   guy says   i am always chasing for something that may seem out of reach    <BRK> but given their odds defying regular season  a national title felt within reach for guy and his teammates  from the first of his facebook posts  written just before the umbc loss   <BRK>  they say with great success comes great responsibility   guy wrote     they can t teach you how to handle everything that comes with winning  they can t prepare you for the hatred and support  or for basketball fans to forget that you re a human being     you have always been a believer that pressure is just a figment of your imagination  as is fear  it only becomes real if you let it  don t buy in now   this has been one of the best seasons in the history of college basketball  why stop now    <BRK> in april    heading into his senior year of high school  guy met former nba player turned trainer derick grant  grant was working with guy s future brother in law  tyler jenkins  now a guard at bellarmine university   after watching guy play one afternoon  grant reached out via text  offering to train him  right away  the two clicked   i ve worked with a lot of guys  and i don t think i ve ever seen a player who the game came to so naturally   grant says   <BRK> they would meet outside l a  fitness at   a m   six days a week  sometimes  grant would arrive at     a m  to find guy  sitting in the driver s seat of his car  asleep  while guy was already known for his shooting prowess  grant wanted to develop the guard s shot creation and versatility on the floor   <BRK> the two continued working together once guy arrived at virginia  slowly  their focus became as much about the mental aspect of the game as the mechanics  midway through last season  grant sensed that something wasn t quite right  in high school  guy texted grant after almost every game  asking what he did wrong and how he could improve  last year  it was grant texting guy  pointing out specifics about his game or just checking in  most of the time  guy didn t answer   that just wasn t like him   red flags were going off   grant says  <BRK> indeed  the loss to umbc finally fractured guy s precarious veneer of confidence  <BRK> after the postgame press conference  guy rode with his team back to the hotel  a police escort following their bus  his family waited in his room  when guy saw them  he broke down again  he felt like he d let everyone down  his friends  family  virginia fans   the hopes of thousands  pressing down on him   <BRK> he turned his phone off for   hours  eleven days later  he was named to the associated press  ap  all america third team  making him the  th player in virginia history to earn all american honors  <BRK> after taking several weeks to process the upset  he wrote the second facebook post that he would publish on april    <BRK>  everyone goes through adversity but not everyone lives there   guy wrote   i don t want this piece to be a pity party  a sermon or preachy  or even a feel good story  i want this to be real  i want this to impact people and i want everyone to understand what my team and i went through    <BRK> guy shared details of how  building up to the ncaa tournament  they knew not to overlook umbc  but as soon as the jokes about a no    seed losing to a   seed began   at that very moment  i let the pressure sink into my mind   guy wrote  he explained how the loss felt almost surreal  how after hunter had to drag him off of the court  he apologized to the seniors before sitting in the showers and crying   there aren t many people who know what it s like to be the only person  program in this instance  in the world to be on the wrong side of history   no one understands the sheer pain and fear to be ridiculed  misery loves company     <BRK> but guy also wrote how the loss was a turning point   it was also at this moment as i walked off the stage that i vowed to not quit and to not let this define me  that feeling of drowning while being able to see everyone else breathe   i was going to work my ass off to never feel this way again   <BRK>  that was me opening up  so people knew that they weren t alone   guy says   even if you think someone s having the greatest life  being a no    seed and a third team all american  they still go through stuff  don t be so quick to judge   <BRK> guy deleted all social media apps from his phone  he finished the semester  often walking around campus with his head down  earbuds in  <BRK>  in college  basketball aside  you go through a lot   says guy s roommate and teammate grant kersey   then you add basketball   we just go out to breakfast and he gets recognized  people see when the lights are on  they don t see the other side   <BRK> when the semester ended  grant drove to charlottesville to pick up guy  on the ride home  grant reminded guy that he couldn t please everyone  or he d be a hamster on a wheel   when you are number one  and you have millions of eyes on you  you have a platform   grant reminded guy   and if you re a pleaser  it can be a recipe for disaster  that wears on you   <BRK> grant and his family had recently moved to naples  florida  so in august  guy and jenkins drove down and spent a week there  grant and guy worked out together every day  they also watched sermons and ted talks and discussed guy s mental approach  <BRK> one of those ted talks was therapist amy morin s the secret to becoming mentally strong   i have this facebook friend whose life seems perfect   morin begins the   minute talk  noting the envy and jealousy that stem from social media scanning  morin shares her own struggles  including the sudden loss of her mother  her first husband  and her father in law   <BRK>  the only way to get through uncomfortable emotions  to deal with them  is you have to go through them   morin says   to let yourself feel sad and then move on  and to gain confidence in your ability to deal with that discomfort    <BRK>  i think initially  he wanted to sweep  the ncaa tournament loss  the season s stress  under the rug  but now he s embraced it and the emotions that come with that   grant says   he was still kind of in a gray area  emotionally  but i could tell he was on his way back up   <BRK> just before   p m  on thursday  nov     guy sat inside the football team meeting room at uva s mccue center  he d arrived to moderate an inaugural student athlete mental health panel  designed to encourage conversation among uva student athletes about the stigmas of mental health  and how to work through them  <BRK> when planning who might speak   we wanted to bring kyle in because we knew it would draw a bigger crowd   says sophomore nicola ferris  one of the co organizers  she emailed guy  who happily agreed to take part  <BRK> guy opened the discussion with the   plus attendees by detailing the aftermath following his team s final game  he talked about the death threats  the hate mail  and how he and his teammates   young men playing a game they love   were the recipients of such intense vitriol  he still hadn t completely recovered from the season s abrupt end  however  he had found ways to work through those pressures and move forward   <BRK>  everyone struggles through something   says uva senior baseball pitcher chesdin harrington  who attended the event   we talked a lot  at the panel  about how  as athletes  you re expected to be mentally tough and to perform at the highest level  continuously  without asking for help  but you have to let things go and ask for help  whether it s a teammate  a friend  or a professional   <BRK> initially  guy was reticent to see freeman  after their first meeting last year   i didn t want to be that person that has to see a sports psychologist   guy says  but jenkins pressed him to continue the conversations  they began to meet weekly  a process they ve continued   it didn t just help me on the court  it helped me in life   guy adds  <BRK> freeman has worked at uva in various therapeutic and research capacities for   years  along with his colleague  associate sports psychologist dr  karen egan  he spends hours each day talking individually with many of the   uva student athletes   <BRK>  my main headline is that mental health is health   freeman says   so  to separate that or make it lesser than or different than health creates stigma and barriers to actually treating anything that s going on with the person    <BRK> according to freeman  uva uses an all encompassing approach to supporting student health  whether addressing sport concussion  learning issues and how they affect performance  mental health issues and how they affect well being or performance psychology  and other areas   <BRK> a one seed s first round loss in the men s ncaa tournament was unprecedented  so there was no precedent for coping  coach bennett did his best to help   <BRK>  at a church service i attended  the pastor talked about this idea of  trembling courage over measured cowardice   i like that   bennett says   i want to let the guys know  it s ok to have doubts  it s ok to be anxious at times  you can be that way and still pursue all that you are worth  as long as you know that you can live with whatever comes your way  success or failure  that was a great lesson in last year s situation   you are still ok  and we will still go after it   <BRK> before each game  guy walks out  crouches at mid court  and says a prayer  he looks at the crowd around him  taking it all in  the fans  the hecklers  the lights  the cameras   an atmosphere of adrenaline and expectation   <BRK>  i chase the highs  for sure   guy says   but not adrenaline  like i need to jump off the cliff  more utopian    <BRK> playing at home against towson university on nov     guy missed several open jump shots in the game s early minutes  during a first half timeout  despite the cavaliers  lead  his expression was a grimace of frustration  he finished the game with only five points    <BRK> five days later  as fifth ranked uva faced george washington university  guy was rejuvenated  with four minutes to play in the first half  he drove to the basket  split two defenders  and nailed a reverse lay up  as the crowd cheered  he grinned toward uva s bench  shrugging his shoulders with a steph curry esque  i don t know how that happened either  expression  guy and fellow backcourt starter ty jerome scored   points apiece  accounting for more than half of uva s total offense  <BRK> guy dominated in the cavaliers  final non conference game before acc play  setting career highs in points      three pointers      and rebounds     in a   point win over marshall  <BRK> the challenges and triumphs of uva s redemptive season have meant accepting that his basketball journey is no longer his own  there s no fix for the fact that so many people have invested their emotions into how he and the cavaliers perform  but he can help himself as best he can   <BRK>  since last year was so rough for me  i approached this year differently   guy says   i m taking more of a business aspect  this is my job  i want to use it as a vehicle to success  i still have love for it  but there s more days that are hard for me to get through than there used to be in basketball   <BRK> mentally  that progression has been steady  after a summer of healing  his continued work with freeman  and his own awareness and openness in dealing with pressure  guy has found himself in a much better place  including being more open with his family and close friends   <BRK>  i wish that there was this one big moment for me  but there wasn t   guy says   it took a lot of hard work  and the people around me helping me through it  the more i stayed in a routine and made mistakes with it  the more i learned about how i was going to cope with it  and it gradually got better  i haven t had a panic attack in a very long time  i m thankful  and i m happy that i figured it out    <BRK> early in the season  guy considered posting a third facebook entry  he wrote it  jenkins edited again  but the day before posting  jenkins questioned his intent   are you posting this for you  or for other people   jenkins asked   because if you are doing this  it should be for you   and no one else   he decided not to post it  <BRK> now  guy records his thoughts in a journal  both handwritten and on his computer  if he wants to post or check on his social media account   which he still does  albeit sporadically   he logs on from his computer  guy s most revealing online appearances now are alongside jenkins on her youtube vlogs  which she says are meant to be  fun   offer insight into their lives together  the apps are still absent from his phone    <BRK> off the court  guy relishes life s daily routines  he has memorized almost every disney film and he loves binge watching tv series  lost  game of thrones  friends  according to kersey  guy is an encyclopedia of random facts   ask him the most common squirrel in north america  he ll answer immediately  and while he loves hanging out with jenkins or his teammates  his apartment with kersey and uva football punter nash griffin has three tvs  one for sports  one for movies  one for fortnite   guy has learned to take time for himself  <BRK>  if i said  no  to anything  i d always have these feelings of guilt of letting people down  but i d hide it with my hakuna matata attitude   guy says  referencing the line from the lion king   now  i m still hakuna matata at heart  but i m trying to show more real emotions   <BRK> guy continues to be tested publicly  on dec     barstool sports  duke blue devils twitter account tweeted about a gofundme campaign begun by one of the head line monitors of the cameron crazies  the campaign aimed to raise    to bring former umbc guard kj maura  who played all   minutes in the upset victory over uva  to cameron indoor stadium for the blue devils  matchup against the cavaliers on jan        the last line on the fundraising page read   contribute some money and let s make kyle guy weep    <BRK> guy read the tweet  but rather than post an angry response or ignore it  he took the jab in stride  he retweeted it  adding   wahoos  let s make this happen   <BRK> several uva donors contributed  the fund reached the total amount  and maura will likely be standing among the crazies in two weeks  <BRK>  i wanted point to out that we re not afraid to face what happened   guy says   no one seems to know how to let it go  so we might as well relish the moment  i don t really care who s in the stands   <BRK> he admits that his response would have been much different a year ago  <BRK>  i think it would ve cut deeper on an external level before   guy says   because it does cut deep on an internal level for me  but i know how to handle it better  <BRK>  in other words  i m ok with it now   <BRK>
