a strange thing happened when i first saw video of ucf head coach johnny dawkins address his team following a heartbreaking loss to duke on sunday night  i re assessed how i look at march madness as a whole  <BRK>  we end in tears   that s because we ve invested so much in each other i love you guys  it s been amazing coaching this group     coach_dawkins pic twitter com b dbnzzwo <BRK> i ll confess i might be slow on the uptake here  i don t intensely follow college basketball from november to february  occasional checks in on my alma mater  a general understanding of who is good  but aside from that i  like many i suspect  live off highlights until march  when we exit our caves like sports loving bears to pore over everything about college basketball before returning to our slumber  <BRK> it becomes so easy to use pejoratives like  they re trash  about teams when we see no    vs  no    games  or root for upsets   but doing that causes us to lose sight of the fact teams have worked their asses off to reach this point  every single one of them  the sacrifice  the bonds  the special seasons   all can get swept away with the ephemeral nature of college sports  as players leave school and move on  <BRK> when i see a coach like johnny dawkins  his voice wavering every so slightly  try and keep it together while delivering a eulogy on ucf s season in front of his weeping players   suddenly everything comes into contrast  the work  the sacrifice  the effort  this wasn t just a team being fed to duke to appease our brackets  they were so much more  <BRK> couldn t be more proud of what these guys showed out there tonight and every step of the way these last three years  thank you to our seniors for helping to build this thing and i m glad you were able to leave your legacy here at ucf  go knights   chargeon pic twitter com  slb occze <BRK> outside of tacko fall i couldn t tell you much about ucf before seeing this video  but i will say i admire their passion  willingness to be vulnerable  and truly playing the game in a way that either meant celebration or tears  just like dawkins said   <BRK> this is what sports are all about  the juxtaposition of adulation and agony only they provide  and we are all willing participants   knowing full well we ll be devastated   percent of the time  there s nothing else like it  and i want to thank johnny dawkins and ucf for reminding me that  <BRK>
