plenty of miles on his odometer  the oft injured all pro struggled through a long list of maladies through his nfl career  dealing with injuries to his back  forearm  groin  and knees that often kept him from the field   he missed   regular season games in his nine seasons in new england  while he claimed he was the healthiest he d been all season before the super bowl  he decided against throwing his body into the fire for one more season  leaving a massive hole in the patriots  passing attack in the process  <BRK> he finished his career with five pro bowl invitations  four first team all pro appearances  three super bowl titles  and the title of   s nfl comeback player of the year  the patriots  including head coach bill belichick and team owner robert kraft  were deferential when addressing his departure  <BRK> statement from bill belichick on  robgronkowski  pic twitter com asivcakf u <BRK> he leaves behind a sport that rewarded his hard work with injuries that include but are not limited to  <BRK> so it s understandable he d be interested in retiring before age    the good news for gronkowski is he was able to put together a strong hall of fame resume in a relatively brief career  he ll retire with three super bowl championship rings  multiple first team all pro honors  and a litany of stories from depressed linebackers and defensive backs about how impossible he was to cover  at     and   pounds   gronk  was a nightmare to track up the seam as well as a crushing blocker who freed up space for his tailbacks  <BRK> gronk just blocked a poor  unwitting chiefs defensive back into oblivion pic twitter com xkjnbggdto <BRK> his   game regular season averages come out to   catches      yards  and   touchdowns  he was just as good in the postseason  with   catches      yards  and   touchdowns in his first   playoff games  gronk was a monster  and the only thing that could effectively slow him was injury  <BRK> he retires having averaged     touchdowns per game  nice  <BRK> gronkowski is irreplaceable  and his retirement will put bill belichick s  next man up  philosophy to the test  the patriots have gone stretches without their all pro tight end in the past  see above   but moving on to life without gronk means tom brady will be without the security blanket target he d turn to in clutch situations across the past decade  gronkowski averaged nearly seven targets per game in his nfl career   more than any other player on the roster  <BRK> brady had nothing but praise for the player who d bailed out his offense in so many big moments in the past  <BRK>  what an honor and privilege to play with you these past nine years  gronk  you accomplished so much and our team was almost unbeatable when you were on the field  your fun loving  inspiring  and positive energy made an impact on everybody you came into contact with  not just that  but for as great as a player you are  you are a better teammate and person  the nfl was a better place with you in it  but i have no doubt you will be a success in anything you do    love you pal  <BRK> a post shared by  tom brady   tombrady  on mar      at    pm pdt <BRK> what an honor and

doubt you will be a success in anything you do    love you pal  <BRK> the solution to the team s newest problem likely isn t already on the roster  dwayne allen had only   catches in his two seasons as a patriot before becoming a salary cap casualty this winter  <BRK> behind allen on the team s roster were jacob hollister and ryan izzo  who each ended   on injured reserve  hollister has been one of belichick s pet projects as an undrafted free agent out of wyoming  but he only has eight career nfl receptions  izzo  a   seventh round pick   has yet to play a game as a pro   <BRK> gronkowski s departure will also put a strain on an already overworked group of wide receivers  julian edelman regained his spot as the team s top wideout this fall  but at age   will face questions about how much longer he can keep this up  behind him are phillip dorsett    signees bruce ellington and maurice harris  and   late round pick braxton berrios  new england will have to make some tough decisions on who will be retained and who will be let go in order to revamp the team s receiving corps  <BRK> although there s a chance gronkowski s retirement isn t quite permanent  <BRK> agent drew rosenhaus on  nflnetwork on gronk s retirement   i was shocked  i thought rob was going to come back and play   his speculation  gut feeling  is that gronk comes back at some point  but rob told rosenhaus he is  done  done  done   <BRK> the good news for the patriots is there s a solid pool of tight ends in the   nfl draft  iowa standouts noah fant and t j  hockenson are both expected to be first round picks  though both may be gone before the team picks at no     new england s combination of need  position  and the fact belichick has a strong relationship with hawkeyes coach kirk ferentz could be enough to necessitate a rare trade up for the pats  either target could help mitigate the loss of gronkowski while serving as a vital step in a patriot roster overhaul  <BRK> but neither will bring the blend of strength  speed  and concentration gronkowski brought to the position  the oft injured tight end s star burned bright  and he ll retire with a hall of fame resume and more than    million in career earnings from the patriots alone  now he s free to expand his party bus business  show up at wrestlemania  and just generally be the human personification of a golden retriever wherever and whenever he likes  <BRK>
