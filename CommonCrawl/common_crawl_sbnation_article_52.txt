by sb nation nfl  <BRK> sometimes it s good to step back and reset  when assessing team needs for the   offseason  we decided to do something to that effect   instead of carrying forward the running list of needs that everybody uses for every team at all times  we elected to see if the stats were telling us anything different  <BRK> below are the primary needs for all   teams if we had  without any knowledge of their roster  simply looked at their   advanced stats and assessed their major weaknesses  some teams are going to have  needs  for positions they re obviously hoping they can address with someone already on the roster   buffalo needing a quarterback  for instance  but it felt like a good time to start clean and simply say   if team a is going to improve in    here are the aspects of their game they need to address   whether that s through free agency  the draft  or in house development  <BRK> the bills used free agency to build around josh allen  getting quantity  if not quality  as they work to prop up their budding franchise qb  wideouts john brown and cole beasley will add viable targets for a weak passing game  and linemen mitch morse and spencer long should keep allen from getting his jersey too dirty in    <BRK> there are still plenty of holes to fill in buffalo  however  the bills lack the kind of game changing wr  who can give beasley  brown  and zay jones room to thrive  they could also use a run stopping plug in the middle of the defensive line now that kyle williams has retired  and the secondary needs help as well  <BRK> miami needs help just about everywhere  and while signing ryan fitzpatrick gives the dolphins some experience at quarterback  he s no long term solution  first year head coach brian flores also brought former patriots eric rowe and dwayne allen south with him  which   yeah  isn t splashy  <BRK> that leaves plenty of work to do in the draft and   will be a rebuilding year  so flores should prioritize adding as much pure talent to a barren roster as possible  replenishing the team s defense   primarily at edge rusher and in the secondary   and the offensive line would be a good start for what could be a long road back to prosperity  <BRK> the patriots watched some premium talent leave this offseason when trent brown and trey flowers each struck off for massive contracts elsewhere and rob gronkowski retired  filling tom brady s need for receiving talent is the uninspiring new group of demaryius thomas  bruce ellington  matt lacosse  maurice harris  and austin seferian jenkins  on the plus side  veterans michael bennett and mike pennel should be able to replace some of the versatile upfront presence flowers left behind  <BRK> new england still needs young blood at wideout and tight end  as well as a dominant pass rusher to keep players like deatrich wise and john simon in rotational roles  with   picks  the patriots could also grab an offensive tackle and   gasp    a quarterback to potentially replace brady one day  if he ever stops playing football   <BRK> new york is following a similar blueprint as buffalo  adding talent around a second year quarterback to help coax a giant leap out  that s brought le veon bell and jamison crowder into town to revamp the offense  while c j  mosley will be called upon to lead the jets  defense  <BRK> the team still needs to address the departures along the interior of its offensive line in order to allow bell to feast and to keep sam darnold upright  new york also needs help at cornerback to allow the jamal adams marcus maye duo to shine and an edge presence to balance out an uneven pass rush  <BRK> the ravens lost some big names  c j  mosley  joe flacco  terrell suggs  and added a pair of their own in earl thomas and mark ingram  that ll add an extra punch to the running game and provide a younger upgrade to eric weddle at safety  but baltimore s chance to repeat as afc north champion may hinge on adding new  dynamic talent in this year s draft  <BRK> the top priority may be giving lamar jackson the receiving  and tight end  talent he needs to thrive as a passer  he could use more help in the middle of his offensive line to clear a path for both him and ingram on the ground  too  the ravens also need pass rushers to replace the production suggs and za darius smith left behind  <BRK> the bengals  quest to move on from the marvin lewis era meant re signing marginal  or oft injured  talent like bobby hart  c j  uzomah  and tyler eifert  vontaze burfict is gone though  so now the steelers will have to drive   more yards than usual each time they play cincinnati  <BRK> new coach zac taylor is an offensive minded leader  but he ll have to draft a cache of defensive talent to restore the bengals to contender status  cincinnati needs help in the trenches  with gaps at both defensive tackle and along the edges  and linebacker support   especially now that burfict is gone  a quarterback to eventually take over for andy dalton could be on the agenda  too  <BRK> only the raiders could match the browns  big name activity this offseason  as new head coach freddie kitchens added odell beckham jr   olivier vernon  kareem hunt  and sheldon richardson to his rising team  this influx of talent  coupled with the strong finish to    has cleveland looking like afc north favorites for the first time in a long  long time  <BRK> there are still holes to be patched  though none especially gaping  a foundational left tackle could upgrade baker mayfield s protection in   and beyond  a linebacker who can be the kirkland version of jamie collins and another cornerback would boost the defense  oh  and a punter would help  too  <BRK> le veon bell  gone  antonio brown  gone  jesse james  also gone  but in much less dramatic fashion  <BRK> who s in  mark barron  steven nelson and  uh  donte moncrief  <BRK> so the steelers need some fresh talent in this year s draft  getting an inside linebacker who can cover rangy tight ends and replace the leadership ryan shazier once provided would be a big win  help at cornerback should artie burns never live up to his potential is also needed  and ben roethlisberger could use some supporting wr te help to keep pittsburgh s offensive legacy intact  <BRK> the texans lost two major components of their   run when starting safeties tyrann mathieu and kareem jackson departed for eight figure salaries elsewhere  kevin johnson and christian covington followed  leaving gaps only be partially filled by free agent signees tashaun gipson  bradley roby  and briean boddy calhoun  <BRK> houston still needs secondary help  especially if roby remains a bit of an enigma  but most importantly it needs to keep deshaun watson   who was sacked an unacceptable   times in     upright and healthy  upgrading an ever porous offensive line will be paramount to the team s afc south title defense  <BRK> the colts jumpstarted their rebuild with a handful of impact additions last offseason  but have been relatively quiet this spring despite a wealth of cap space  indianapolis re signed pierre desir  bet on devin funchess living up to his potential with andrew luck  and then lured justin houston north after he was released by the chiefs to cap a small   but potent   free agent haul  <BRK> chris ballard absolutely nailed last year s draft  adding two different all pros  this year he needs some wide receiving help behind t y  hilton and funchess  a pass rusher to thrive next to veterans houston and jabaal sheard  and some secondary help to keep desir from shouldering the entire load in the defensive backfield  he ll have four top   picks to get there  <BRK>   was an impressive mess  and the   offseason brought quarterback nick foles and not much else to help it  jacksonville is betting last year s defensive regression won t last  adding only green bay linebacker jake ryan despite losing tashaun gipson and malik jackson  it still has several good  young players in place  but it would benefit from finding an edge rusher to pair with yannick ngakoue  <BRK> the jaguars  lack of cap space places an extra emphasis on drafting playmakers   particularly wide receivers and tight ends who can expand foles  margin of error  on a similar note  help at either tackle position would help keep foles protected  he was sacked     percent the past two years in philadelphia  while blake bortles and cody kessler were sacked on   percent of their dropbacks in    <BRK> tennessee has to make a decision about whether to commit to marcus mariota at quarterback or not as he enters the final year of his rookie contract  the team has given him some extra weapons this offseason  signing slot receiver adam humphries and lineman rodger saffold  the latter will be particularly useful after losing both his starting guards from     josh kline and quinton spain   this spring  <BRK> adding more playmakers would help mariota be his best self  but a few impact defenders could transform the titans  defense from good to great  tennessee needs additional depth at all three levels of the defense  including pass rushing presences both inside and out and some safety help alongside kevin byard  fortunately  the   nfl draft is loaded with those type of players  <BRK> john elway has pegged joe flacco  a man with worse numbers than case keenum in    as his keenum replacement  and though he added ja wuan james to hold down the right tackle spot  he also lost interior blockers matt paradis and billy turner in free agency  creating a need to protect the former super bowl mvp   or whichever rookie takes over  <BRK> yep  quarterback is a major need elway will have to address at the   nfl draft  so is tight end  where jake butt has been limited to just three games in two seasons due to injury  the denver defense could also use an infusion of talent after backsliding in    most notably  the broncos could use a powerful defensive tackle who can take the blocking attention away from von miller and bradley chubb along the edges  <BRK> the chiefs needed defense  but were too cash strapped to keep the big names they already had in    eric berry  dee ford  steven nelson  and justin houston are all gone from last year s afc finalist squad  tyrann mathieu and alex okafor will help bolster the defensive rebuild  but they ll need help  <BRK> kansas city enters the draft with several needs and some unappealing picks with which to fill them  the club needs pass rushers who can provide the exterior pressure to allow chris jones to feast  it needs secondary help to keep teams from outscoring patrick mahomes  and  if the value is there  the chiefs wouldn t be too off base by picking up some interior line help to keep mahomes upright  <BRK> the chargers    put them back in contention for the afc west crown  but a tight salary cap situation meant the biggest contract they d hand out would go to backup quarterback tyrod taylor  los angeles  free agent losses were minimal   deep threat tyrell williams  lane clogging dt darius philon  and oft injured cornerback jason verrett foremost among them   so there s a chance philip rivers  team can compete in   even without a new crop of rookie playmakers  <BRK> of course  an impact draft class could be the missing piece that sends rivers to his first super bowl  la needs receiving talent to replace williams and give keenan allen some downfield support   especially if allen gets injured again  the team could also use some help along the edges to keep its veteran quarterback protected  <BRK> jon gruden s second offseason was somehow busier than his first  as he handed out massive deals to trent brown  tyrell williams  and lamarcus joyner after trading for unhappy pittsburgh wideout antonio brown  vontaze burfict is also here to give john madden flashbacks of his  s oakland squads  <BRK> the raiders are primed for a bounce back  but they ve still got needs to address if they re going to compete in the ultra tough afc west  they no longer have a khalil mack like presence in the pass rush and could use help both on the edge and from the interior of their defensive line  they also need secondary help   a need that s haunted the team for what seems like the past decade   and a useful dual threat tailback to replace marshawn lynch   whenever  <BRK> the cowboys used this offseason to keep demarcus lawrence locked down and bring jason witten out of retirement  which is a boon for both their receiving corps and any of us who failed to mute monday night football in    signing randall cobb adds an extra weapon for dak prescott  who will be without cole beasley and geoff swaim after both signed elsewhere  and while george iloka isn t earl thomas  he ll still add value to the dallas secondary  <BRK> but prescott still needs targets  particularly at tight end with witten pushing   years old  and that defense could use a long term solution at safety  especially since iloka is only signed for a single year  getting lawrence a pocket crumpling running mate would be a boost as well  <BRK> dave gettleman s reshaping of the giants  roster has been puzzling for much of the   offseason  he traded both odell beckham jr  and olivier vernon to the browns  leaving big shoes to fill at wide receiver and defensive end   although the latter trade landed guard kevin zeitler in new york  helping to upgrade an offensive line that struggled in    the giants also lost landon collins  one of the best young safeties in the nfl  in free agency  <BRK> the giants found replacements by signing receiver golden tate  pass rusher markus golden  and safety antoine bethea  but all three are downgrades  and the team still has work to do at the most premium positions   not to mention quarterback  where a replacement for eli manning needs to be found soon  <BRK> the eagles already have a roster that should continue to be in super bowl contention  so the offseason has mostly just been small tinkering to make it even better  the eagles added malik jackson to the defensive line  traded to bring receiver desean jackson back to where his career began  and added running back jordan howard in another trade  <BRK> there are no holes on the roster that desperately need to be filled  but philadelphia could stand to add defensive depth  michael bennett was traded away to the patriots  leaving room for another pass rusher to be added to the mix  more help in the secondary and a replacement for   year old left tackle jason peters could also be top priorities  <BRK> the offseason started for washington in a big way with the addition of landon collins  a transformative safety who should make a gigantic difference on defense  the problem is the rest of the spring has just been depressing for the team  <BRK> alex smith probably won t be back in    and washington acquired case keenum as the quarterback to temporarily fill those shoes  the team also signed colossal draft bust ereck flowers for offensive line depth  and pulled cornerback dominique rodgers cromartie out of his brief retirement  <BRK> washington is left with plenty of rebuilding to do  a quarterback of the future needs to be found at some point  but a pass rusher to complement ryan kerrigan may be the even higher priority  the team also needs receivers  defensive backs  and offensive linemen  <BRK> last year  the bears dove headfirst into free agency and then landed khalil mack in a trade just before the regular season  the   offseason hasn t been nearly as exciting  but it hasn t had to be  chicago is already a contender and tried nudging itself over the hump by signing safety ha ha clinton dix and receiver cordarrelle patterson  <BRK> clinton dix will help offset the loss of adrian amos  who joined the packers in free agency  the bears also lost cornerback bryce callahan and running back jordan howard  but the additions of buster skrine and mike davis should fill those holes  <BRK> all that leaves little work left for general manager ryan pace to do in the draft  the bears could target help in the secondary  another pass rusher  or hunt for some skill position upgrades  <BRK> the coup of the offseason for the lions was pass rusher trey flowers  who will make a big difference on defense if he provides more consistency than ezekiel ansah did  that was far from the only move detroit made  though  the lions also brought on cornerbacks justin coleman and rashaan melvin  tight end jesse james  and receiver danny amendola  <BRK> still  the roster has plenty of reconstruction left to do  matthew stafford needs more help  and detroit could benefit from drafting another receiver and one of the many top tight end prospects this year  most of all  matt patricia could use more pieces on defense   especially in the secondary and on a defensive line that needs to add more than just flowers  <BRK> it was an uncharacteristically active venture into free agency for the packers  who added safety adrian amos  linebackers za darius smith and preston smith  and offensive lineman billy turner  all those additions free up green bay to use the draft to fulfill its top priority of the offseason  make aaron rodgers happy  <BRK> outside of davante adams  there really aren t many receiving options that the packers can feel comfortable with on the roster  both receivers and tight ends could be on the draft day wish list for green bay  the packers could also stand to round out the defense with linemen and defensive backs to complement their free agent additions  <BRK> the vikings  defense was still good in    but quarterback kirk cousins wasn t the savior who pushed the team over the top  part of his struggled can be attributed to an offensive line that failed to clear space  minnesota hasn t done much to fix that yet  though  it lost nick easton in free agency released mike remmers  and only spent big money to retain anthony barr  <BRK> protecting cousins is clearly the top priority heading into the draft  at both guard and tackle  other places on the roster   like running back  wide receiver  and defensive tackle   could stand to add depth as well  <BRK> the offseason for the falcons has consisted of more subtraction than addition with tevin coleman  robert alford  andy levitre  and bruce irvin all leaving as free agents  atlanta kept the most important impending free agent  though  by giving defensive tackle grady jarrett the franchise tag  <BRK> still  matt ryan has no shortage of weapons  and the defense has speed at linebacker and in the secondary  now  atlanta needs to add beef on both sides of the ball  <BRK> the defensive line will be the more important project of the two with defensive tackles and pass rushers at the top of the wish list  the offensive line needs help too  but adding james carpenter and jamon brown in free agency may serve as a solid band aid for the situation  <BRK> it s starting to feel like a bit of a broken record at this point  the panthers need to upgrade cam newton s supporting cast  keeping offensive tackle daryl williams and signing center matt paradis was a start  but the offensive line could still use more help and receiving options are thin after d j  moore and curtis samuel   especially after the departure of devin funchess  <BRK> but the bigger issue is a defensive line that has kawann short  mario addison  and not much else  julius peppers finally retired and that leaves pass rusher as the clear top priority for the team heading into the draft  <BRK> the saints didn t need to do much this offseason after a   win season  and that s good because they didn t have many resources to use  new orleans needs cap space in the reserves to lock down michael thomas and alvin kamara for the future  but the team still managed to tinker away in free agency and add tight end jared cook and center nick easton  it lost pass rusher alex okafor and running back mark ingram  but replaced the latter with latavius murray  <BRK> new orleans isn t scheduled to make its first draft pick until late in the second round  but there s no single pressing need that the saints have to address  adding a defensive tackle  wide receiver  or cornerback who can contribute as a rookie could be all it takes to push the saints over the top  <BRK> bruce arians  first year coaching in tampa looks like a rebuilding one  the bucs made few big moves this offseason  their most expensive signing of the spring was punter bradley pinion  kwon alexander  adam humphries  and even ryan fitzpatrick have all moved on from tampa bay  leaving arians with an opportunity to shape the team in his image  <BRK> alexander s departure leaves a hole in the middle of the defense  and the receiving corps are pretty limited after mike evans thanks to humphries  departure and the trade that shipped desean jackson back to philadelphia  some high upside defensive backs would also help bolster one of the league s worst passing defenses   and allow quarterback jameis winston to win some games that aren t shootouts  <BRK> while the cardinals made some minor moves to improve an awful roster this offseason  their rebound from   s bottoming out will come through the draft  defenders like jordan hicks  darius philon  and robert alford were strong supporting additions  but players like j r  sweezy  charles clay  and a   year old terrell suggs probably aren t going to be instrumental to the team s rebuild  <BRK> kyler murray would  however  taking a second straight first round quarterback would give debuting head coach kliff kingsbury a passer he s long coveted and make arizona infinitely more entertaining  the cardinals need plenty of help elsewhere  no matter who their   qb is   restocking the team s offensive line and receiving corps should be a priority during the draft  <BRK>   has been a measured offseason for a rams team that built an nfc champion over the course of the previous two years  starters like lamarcus joyner  rodger saffold  and mark barron have departed  replaced by eric weddle  clay matthews  and whomever can step up either in this year s draft or from previous drafts  <BRK> the reigning nfc west champs aren t hurting for talent  but an aging secondary could use reinforcements   many of which will be available at the end of the first round  there s need up front  too  especially since it appears ndamukong suh won t be returning to los angeles this fall  <BRK> san francisco lost a season due to quarterback jimmy garoppolo s knee injury  but   should bring improvements thanks to the expensive addition of linebacker kwon alexander and pass rusher dee ford  and the low risk  high reward signings of tevin coleman  jordan matthews  and jason verrett  the free agent losses were minimal  too   the biggest names leaving santa clara were punter bradley pinion and rotational pass rusher cassius marsh  <BRK> the niners have premier position in this year s draft  which should allow them to pick up the pass rushing talent they need with the no    selection  their second round spot will yield a solid group of young receivers to team up with marquise goodwin  george kittle  and dante pettis and push garoppolo to a resurgent season  a little extra blocking wouldn t hurt  either  <BRK> seattle s latest attempt to protect russell wilson swaps out j r  sweezy for mike iupati  which is a step in the right direction but probably not enough for wilson to avoid being one of the league s most sacked qbs again  while retaining k j  wright and the awaiting sentence for insider trading mychal kendricks helps  that won t offset the losses of defenders like shamar stephen  justin coleman  and especially earl thomas  <BRK> if the seahawks want to stave off a decline  they ll have to add some defensive talent both up front and in the backfield to provide at least a passable imitation of the former legion of boom  wilson still needs help too   not just from a cheesecloth offensive line  but also from a group of wide receiver and tight end targets led by tyler lockett and a   year old doug baldwin  <BRK>     vox
