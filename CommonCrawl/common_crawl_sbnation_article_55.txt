rob gronkowski called it a career sunday  and now the patriots are in trouble  <BRK> losing gronkowski is the biggest blow   s dealt to an already weak new england receiving corps  only three wide receivers or tight ends who caught a pass last fall are set to return for the upcoming season   julian edelman  phillip dorsett  and little used tight end jacob hollister  without gronk on board to give tom brady gaping windows to throw the ball downfield  all three will see more defensive attention than ever  <BRK> replacing him won t be easy  or maybe even possible  even in a diminished state he remained a singular force who could take over games like no other player could  <BRK> gronk s last   seasons averaged       ypa     success rate    passer rtg those rank             best in the nfl for any player with at least   targets the last   years     ypa on  rd down target  best in nfl  mismatch nightmare  absolute stud gone far too soon  <BRK> that leaves head coach bill belichick with an unenviable task  new england has already been proactive on the free agent market in an extremely new england way  the patriots re signed useful wideout dorsett      percent catch rate    yards per reception with brady  to a one year deal  they also added matt lacosse  bruce ellington  and maurice harris to the lineup  the four of them combined for   catches last season  so a couple of them are either going to have to make an unexpected leap or brady is going to need some more help  <BRK> unfortunately  this year s thin free agent receiving corps has been picked over  adam humphries was a top target  but new england s hesitance in contract talks allowed him to sign with the titans instead  golden tate is a giant  jared cook  the best available veteran tight end  flirted with the patriots before signing with the saints for more money  <BRK> so who is left to fill some of the biggest shoes in the league  there are three avenues the pats can take   and they ll need help at both tight and and wide receiver to do so  <BRK> by most accounts  including sb nation s own dan kadar  fant and hockenson will be the first two tight ends off the board  it s easy to see why  the hawkeye duo combined upper tier blocking  elite athleticism  especially in fant s case   and proven production in the passing game  they finished first and second in receiving yards for iowa in    combining for   catches      receiving yards  and   touchdowns   <BRK> they also come from a program belichick has skimmed from in the past  his relationship with hawkeyes head coach kirk ferentz has helped push graduates like cole croston  riley mccarron  and ferentz s son james to the new england roster in recent years  <BRK> the patriots  problem this spring may be that both they and iowa s tight ends were too good this past season  neither player is expected to last until new england s selection at no    in the first round  the pats can change all that by dipping into a vast resource of assets   they have   picks in april  more than any other team  including six of the top     and trading up if they re truly sold on fant or hockenson  if either one slides to the end of the first round  it seems a safe bet they ll be on their way to foxborough  the two hawkeyes are the top two most popular mock draft picks for new england this year  <BRK> the crimson tide product comes from another pipeline to which belichick has long turned   though it s not as though picking a player from nick saban s assembly line in tuscaloosa is an especially rare or special thing  smith is following o j  howard s lead into the nfl as an uber athletic alabama tight end with first round aspirations  with a     second   yard dash time and upper level performances on the bench and in the   yard shuttle at the nfl combine  he s got the power and athleticism to shine at the next level  <BRK> but smith is no sure thing  he s only got one season as a full time starter under his belt in college  and while he put up solid numbers    catches    yards    tds   that may have been a function of a tua tagovailoa aerial attack that made every member of the bama offense look immortal at times   <BRK> still  he s got nfl bloodlines  his dad played tight end for the saints and was seemingly inserted into every pack of upper deck cards i bought from   to    and is interested in a move to the northeast  <BRK>  https   t co tbeiutm nl <BRK> but he could also be gone by pick     kadar s latest mock draft has him getting snapped him by the target needy packers at no     if that s the case  day   candidates like texas a m s jace sternberger or stanford s kaden smith could be in play  <BRK> mclaurin and campbell have each seen their stock rise in the pre draft process  turning in eye catching workout numbers after excellent   seasons with the buckeyes  campbell led the team with   catches for     yards and   touchdowns before showing out with a     second   time at the combine  tied for the top mark among receivers  and pulling off top five showings in the long and broad jumps   <BRK> mclaurin averaged an absurd   yards per catch as a senior and turned heads both at the senior bowl and in his pro day workout  he s gone from a potential late round steal to possible early day   pick   and the patriots have six selections to work with those days   <BRK> other early wideout picks who could be in play with new england s first two selections of this year s draft include riley ridley  n keal harry  deebo samuel  and a j  brown  but if belichick spurns the opportunity to make a day   wideout his waterloo once more  there are a few other less hyped prospects who could fit his needs  <BRK> scrappy undersized wideouts who were lightly regarded as recruits and still face major questions as they transition to the nfl despite prolific college football careers  that would never work in new england  <BRK> if the patriots are looking for wideout prospects deeper in the the draft  they ll have their choice of extremely patriot looking players  isabella showed off his burner bonafides with a       at the combine  and waiting long into day   could mean waiting too long on a player who was prolific at umass   he had   catches and     yards last season  renfrow wasn t as impressive  but his history of showing up in big games means his name has been circled in belichick s day planner since january     <BRK> also up for inclusion here is west virginia touchdown machine david sills v  who would be the latest quarterback turned wideout to join the patriots  receiving corps  <BRK> here s the toughest part to predict  belichick s lack of success drafting a wide receiver has been balanced out by his ability to add impact targets in various different swaps  randy moss  wes welker  and brandin cooks all came to new england via trade  <BRK> gronkowski s retirement opens up the cap space to add an impact veteran this offseason  if belichick decides to pull the trigger  here are some names who could be logical fits  <BRK> sanu has long been one of the best supporting cast wide receivers in the nfl   a player who provides a valuable second option  occasional deep threat  and reliable hands on third down  he s also set to cost the falcons      million this fall  which could be an untenable number for a team with only an estimated      million of cap space in    trading away sanu  whose value is mitigated by the presence of julio jones and calvin ridley atop the atlanta depth chart  would create both immediate and long term savings thanks to the rookie contract of the player eventually drafted by the falcons with whichever picks the pats send south  <BRK> the move would give brady another reliable veteran wideout atop his receiving depth chart and belichick another rutgers product he so values  the edelman sanu combination might give new england the league s top pair of pass throwing wideouts  too  <BRK> it was only two years ago the draft world was in love with ross  whose record setting     second   yard dash prompted cincinnati to ignore concerns about his college production and consistency and make him the no    pick of the   nfl draft  in two years as a pro he s caught just   percent of his targets  making   receptions on   passes thrown his way and generally serving as an idle deep threat in southwestern ohio  <BRK> that lack of impact has reportedly put him on the trading block in cincinnati  but he could regain his value playing in a more stable passing environment with the patriots  his ability to stretch the field could create space for edelman and whomever else winds up on the wr te depth chart on intermediate routes  similar to how josh gordon s presence softened up defenses even when he wasn t a target  of course  ross will have to prove himself repeatedly just to earn a whiff of the respect even an inconsistent gordon got in    but it s not a massive stretch to see how he could fit in the new england offense  <BRK> like sanu  agholor is an expensive player on a team strapped for cap space  the fifth year option on his rookie contract is set to pay him more than    million in    unlike sanu  agholor has yet to be a consistent receiving threat   though his   breakout prevented him from becoming a first round bust  he s recorded   catches      yards  and   touchdowns over the past two seasons to emerge as a versatile deep threat  <BRK> the eagles have shed enough salary to afford agholor s expensive fifth year  but keeping him is no longer a top priority after the trade that reunited desean jackson and the city of brotherly love earlier this offseason  philadelphia could ship him off in   rather than let him leave with no return other than a potential compensatory   draft pick next winter  it s not like these two teams are opposed to doing business  either   general manager howie roseman already took new england s fifth round pick in the michael bennett trade earlier this year  <BRK> tampa bay signed brate to a six year       million contract extension last march   a kinda strange twist after drafting alabama tight end howard less than a year earlier  while the bucs  plan may have been to play the two together as dual threats like new england had with gronkowski and aaron hernandez  brate has mostly been shunted to a supporting role  he had just   catches and   yards   although with six touchdowns   while making only two starts in    <BRK> new head coach bruce arians may have more involved plans for brate  or he may want a fresh start and some extra cap space currently tied up over the final five years and      million on the harvard product s deal  brate isn t a gronkowski replacement up the seam  but he s a valuable red zone target with   touchdowns over the past three seasons   nearly   percent of his catches  the buccaneers backup fills a need in new england  the question is whether arians is interested in parting with him  <BRK> the patriots have roughly    million left to spend this spring  but few big name targets available to spend that money on  the tight end market is relatively barren  with decent  unexciting pieces  dion sims  lance kendricks   former second round picks who never lived up to the hype  austin seferian jenkins  maxx williams   and guys who were once patriots  matt lengel  a j  derby  shrugging their way across a shallow pool of talent  <BRK> from the top   free agents  to mock drafts  to scouting reports  we ve got everything you need to get through the offseason  all in one place  <BRK> there are a few more interesting names at wideout  though new england s recent efforts to bring less wanted veteran help backfired horribly when eric decker  jordan matthews  and kenny britt were all released before the   season began  the team s effort to bring young reclamation projects into the fold didn t pan out either  with corey coleman and amara darboh each earning their releases before playing a single game with the team  <BRK> that makes it easy to understand why belichick would be reticent to dive into a receiver market filled with well known but flawed names  demaryius thomas  level of play dropped significantly in   before he tore his achilles  pierre garcon will be   this year and missed   total games over the last two seasons  ryan grant had the opportunity to play with andrew luck and allow t y  hilton to relieve some of the defensive pressure he faced  but he failed to match his solid   campaign in washington  <BRK> jermaine kearse is coming off his worst non rookie season as a pro  jordy nelson finished   on a high note    catches    yards in his final five games   but is also going to be   in    kelvin benjamin has the strongest combination of talent and youth of anyone on this list  he s also seems like the kind of guy belichick would cut after two practices  <BRK>  bills josh allen just asked kelvin benjamin if he wanted to work on routes pregame during warm ups   kelvin s answer  no <BRK> bringing back chris hogan would help  though he s still trying to find a way to recapture his deep threat magic from   and was rendered entirely anonymous in multiple games last fall  other familiar faces like brandon lafell and michael floyd could also wind up back on the team s list  no matter who the club picks at this stage  it appears diving into free agency is the least exciting option for the patriots  <BRK> losing gronkowski doesn t just leave a hole in new england s tight end depth chart  it forces the patriots to replace the guy who created looser coverage for the rest of his teammates downfield and find a new security blanket for brady when he needs to pull a game changing clutch play out of his hat  <BRK> while versatile players like james white and rex burkhead can take on some of the burden in the passing game and sony michel looks like the team s most potent lead runner since corey dillon  there s plenty of work still to be done   even if gordon is cleared for a return to the field  <BRK> there s no one solution to this problem  in    the patriots have three avenues to begin chipping away at the biggest possible non belichick  non brady loss on the roster  even if they choose correctly  we may not know until     or later  <BRK>
