the houston rockets clinched their seventh consecutive playoff berth after last night s win over the new orleans pelicans  which ties two other stretches of appearances for the most in franchise history  it s a record of consistency and success that rockets fans primarily owe to their two main franchise cornerstones  daryl morey and james harden  <BRK> morey was brought in in   after the departure of long time franchise staple carrol dawson  and although he oversaw the final hurrah of the yao mcgrady years  it wasn t long before morey was tasked with rebuilding the team following the infamous decline of houston s star duo   <BRK> while the rockets would miss the playoffs for three straight seasons from      the houston gm was developing his  moreyball  strategy while he waited for the opportunity to grab an ever elusive superstar  but even though morey s vision was unfulfilled without a star player  we saw the beginnings of what we know as his full fledged philosophy today  <BRK> he prized efficiency  bringing in guys like kevin martin  who s three ball and free throw heavy game was actually a few years ahead of it s time  even if martin wasn t the guy to fully actualize it  and morey also had head starts on players like goran dragic  garrett temple  and kyle lowry  even if they wound up finding their greatest success with other teams  <BRK> morey kept the franchise afloat through the three non playoff years  never suffering a losing record in any of them  never tanking  and always keeping the team competitive despite a slew of mid first round draft picks and nothing near the top  he was expertly biding his time until the moment would arrive for a franchise changing move   <BRK> the moment finally came on october       when morey traded martin  jeremy lamb  two first round picks and a second round pick to the oklahoma city thunder for james harden and filler  harden was coming off a campaign in which he won sixth man of the year and helped lead the thunder to the nba finals  and as he was about the grow into his physical prime  morey saw the potential for the superstar he so coveted   <BRK> and it was the perfect marriage between player and franchise  harden wanted a chance to be  the man   and the rockets were willing to give him that shot  and their gm s philosophy of either shooting a three or getting to the bucket and drawing a foul in the process meshed perfectly with harden s skill set  and the results were instantaneous  <BRK> the rockets were back in the postseason in harden s first year with the club  finishing      and harden averaged almost   points per game in his first year as a full time starter  and that was just the tip of the iceberg  as morey finally had the big gun he desired and could build the ancillary players accordingly   <BRK> even in the ultimately failed dwight howard signing  d  was brought in because of how well he fit next to harden on paper  everyone just under estimated his childishness and overestimated his willingness to run the pick and roll  but even the howard signing  despite dissolving into dysfunction  reached a high water mark of the western conference finals in    <BRK> the howard situation  despite ending negatively  showed off morey s ability to adjust his plan after a failure  as the houston gm built around the beard in a different way  first  he brought in head coach mike d antoni  it was a move widely panned by many  including possibly even this website at the time  but morey proved once again why he s often the smartest guy in the room and a perfect fit for this franchise   <BRK> d antoni s confidence in his players and the freedom he afforded them on the court was another perfect  glove like fit  and harden immediately responded to a somewhat controversial  at least nationally  move to point guard with his finest statistical season of his career to that point  averaging   points    rebounds and   assists   <BRK> a disappointing loss in the playoffs to the san antonio spurs sparked another morey masterpiece  as he swung a mega deal in the next offseason for future hall of fame point guard chris paul  with plenty of questions whether cp  and the beard could share and share alike one measly ball  the pair instead made beautiful music together  leading the rockets to a franchise best   wins and were a singular pulled hamstring away from a likely nba title   <BRK> all this time  harden continued to grow as player  adding more to his game each and every season  he took the criticism of his defense to heart  making drastic improvements to his play on that end  while the addition of paul as another playmaker gave harden the freedom to develop the game s most devastating offensive repertoire  the maturation of clint capela   a morey draft pick  into a pick and roll nightmare for the opposition only made harden that much more effective as a scorer   <BRK> the beard won the   mvp award  but just when you thought it might have been harden s pinnacle  he took things to another level this year  we ve been over his contributions endlessly here at tds  and i think conrad pretty much laid it all out for us this weekend  but he s having the most dominant offensive season we ve seen in the nba for decades   <BRK> as for morey  he once again showed an uncanny ability to move on from a failure  essentially wiping clean a failed offseason of carmelo anthony  james ennis  and michael carter williams and turning them into danuel house  austin rivers  kenneth faried  and iman shumpert  it was an epic mid season pivot by the gm  and that along with harden s record setting nightly supernova saved houston s season  they now stand on the precipice of a top three seed in the brutal western conference  <BRK> it seems extremely silly now  but there were legitimate questions after houston s     start about the direction of this team s future  new owner tillman fertitta was a bit of a wildcard in these matters  but that was laid all to rest after morey s expert mid season maneuvering and fertitta offering up a deserved five year extension as a reward  <BRK> morey s now signed through    while james harden is on board until at least    which is good news for rockets fans  because houston is        percent  since morey took over as gm last decade  crazy    and they re        percent  since trading for harden  they ve exceeded   wins in four of harden s six seasons  with the same number just three wins away this year with eight games remaining   <BRK> this seven season playoff streak now ties them with the group from     and the group from      coincidentally both involving the last rockets all time super great  sorry yao and t mac  love you both  but you re not quite on that level   <BRK> it can t be easy living in the shadow of hakeem olajuwon  rudy t  and les alexander  but the only thing left for this group to achieve is an nba title   <BRK> they have been close  twice advancing to the western conference finals where they would lose to an all time great team  certainly no shame in that   and something tells me the championship title part of this story is very  very far from finished   the rockets have legitimate championship aspirations this year  no one s playing better ball since the all star break   and their key player gm duo is locked up well into the next decade  <BRK> though with how perfect a fit both of these guys are for the city  the team  the fans  and for each other  i wouldn t be surprised to see either one of them stay around even longer  harden loves houston  and houston loves the beard  a case of a city and it s superstar with legit feelsies for one another   <BRK> and of course no one can deny the one indomitable truth we all know as rockets fans  in morey we trust  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
