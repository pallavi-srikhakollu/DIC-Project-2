new england patriots tight end rob gronkowski announced his retirement sunday  and the team is left to find a playmaker replacement  gronk was third on the team in receptions and fourth in yards  but he closed out his career as a talent who would draw double teams regularly  <BRK> his departure has not caused any significant changes in the team s various   gambling odds  the westgate superbook released their latest super bowl  conference championship  and divisional odds  and they have held steady  the patriots remain     to win super bowl        to win the afc championship  and     to win the afc east  <BRK> gronk s retirement is likely to lower patriots fan optimism a little bit  but people bet on the patriots because of tom brady and bill belichick  unless either retires or brady suffers a significant injury  we won t see big changes in super bowl or divisional odds  <BRK> gronk retires as arguably the greatest tight end in nfl history  and costs the patriots a key cog and blocker  however  there are few players who will drastically move futures odds on their own  people might be a little more pessimistic about the patriots  offense  but not enough yet to result in much movement on the odds  <BRK>
