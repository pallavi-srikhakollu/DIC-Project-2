the ncaa division i women s basketball tournament begins friday  which means that the wnba draft is right around the corner  while it s likely that wnba scouts have seen enough of the bigger names in the senior class  as well as draft eligible juniors  to form opinions on them  not everyone s draft position is solidified  <BRK> players who want to pursue professional careers will thus have this one last chance to make a good impression on potential employers  with that in mind  let s take a quick look at three wnba prospects that have the most to gain from a lengthy ncaa tournament run  <BRK> it s tough for mid major prospects to make the wnba  no matter how dominant a player is  if she s not playing in a  power five  conference  there will be questions about how she d look against stronger competition   specifically  against fellow wnba prospects   <BRK> such is the plight for dillard  even after buffalo s improbable ncaa tournament run in    which included blowout wins over higher seeded south florida and florida state   she entered the     season as an underdog  once again  dillard was rarely listed as a player to watch or a surefire wnba draft pick jockeying for position on the big board  <BRK> dillard s response  forcing her way into the conversation by dominating the stat sheet  it s been an incredible season for buffalo s lead guard  per her hoop stats  dillard s     points per game ranked second in the nation  while she ranked in the  th percentile in both assists       and steals       per game  dillard also led the country in total free throw trips  imposing her will on defenses just as she has on draft boards  <BRK> even after posting such gaudy numbers and winning mac tournament mvp honors  though  dillard still faces an uphill battle when it comes to her wnba draft stock  her final opportunity to appeal to wnba gms will be in the ncaa tournament  another buffalo upset or two might be more convincing than anything else to those at the professional level  <BRK> espnw s pick for national player of the year  gustafson has been nothing short of brilliant all season long  the numbers she s put up have been monstrous      points  first among all division i players  and     rebounds  along with a ridiculous     points per scoring attempt  gustafson s dominance on the low block was on full display during the big ten tournament  when she dropped a cool   points on perennial favorites maryland en route to tourney mvp honors  <BRK> still  when it comes to wnba mock drafts  gustafson is typically listed below fellow centers teaira mccowan  kalani brown and kristine anigwe  most pre tournament projections have her going late in the first round  from a physical perspective  it s not difficult to see why  she s not as big as mccowan and brown  nor as athletic as anigwe   <BRK> what gustafson does have  however  is a soft touch at the rim  patience with the basketball  and an endless array of low post moves that have frustrated big ten opponents for years  gustafson s balance  footwork and ability to finish with either hand make her arguably the most skilled center in the class  <BRK> what she ll have to do  then  is prove herself against the country s best  for all of gustafson s individual accolades  the one thing she s missing on her résumé is ncaa tournament success  a deep run in this year s tourney could be of great benefit to her draft stock  <BRK> it s been an up and down season for missouri in the sec  losses to florida  lsu and tennessee hurt them  but they also beat sec champs and ncaa runner up mississippi state  they ve been rewarded with a no    seed in the greensboro region  which features plenty of intriguing potential matchups for the tigers  <BRK> missouri s one consistent factor throughout the season has been cunningham  she finished conference play on a tear  and as a wnba prospect  there s plenty to like about her  cunningham is a   foot   perimeter player who can shoot the   pointer at a high level       percent this season and     percent the season prior  <BRK> still  there s something keeping cunningham from entering the discussion of top draft prospects  perhaps missouri s good but not great regular season has played a part in that  or it could be that cunningham s physicality doesn t blow people away  if the latter is true  then cunningham has likely been slotted as a late first  or early second round draft pick for some time now  <BRK> even so  should missouri advance to the later rounds in the greensboro region  cunningham could make a late push up the draft boards  an upset of iowa  for instance  would be huge for the tigers  and their fiery leader could get a final reevaluation by potential wnba coaches as a result  <BRK>
