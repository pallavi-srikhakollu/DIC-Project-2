the nfl s official start to their new league year is here  but due to the league s negotiating or  legal tampering  period  many of the big name free agents are already off the market  that s because the negotiating period allows agents and teams to enter into contract talks even though pen cannot be put to paper until the start of the new league year  <BRK> last year was a frenzy during the negotiating period  with most of the top players gone by the time the market actually opened  a whole bunch of deals were cemented right at   p m  et when the league year started  and that s the case this year as well  players can continue negotiating with other teams after agreeing in principle to a new deal   nothing is final until the contract is signed and submitted to the league office  but once something is reported as a done deal  there is minimal flip flopping  <BRK> it s likely this trend   the biggest players agreeing to deals before free agency actually starts   will continue   <BRK>
