when russell turner lead his uc irvine men s basketball team into an ncaa tournament matchup against the oregon ducks  he decided he was going to use sexist and homophobic taunts to rattle opposing player louis king   <BRK> in his post game presser  turner bragged that his taunts   calling king a  queen    had in fact worked for a while  he admitted to repeating the taunt  at least throughout the first half of the game  <BRK> now that his embarrassing behavior has garnered the attention of uc irvine administrators  alumni and the media  turner has issued an apology that demonstrates no understanding whatsoever of the underlying issues of his behavior   <BRK> his statement  in full  released by the uc irvine athletics department late monday   <BRK> i would like to address my post game comments  i recognize my actions were inappropriate and insensitive   i share uc irvine s belief that inclusivity and diversity are paramount values  and i apologize for not understanding that my actions during the game suggested otherwise  <BRK> i respect oregon s men s basketball program  its student athletes  and its coaches   since the conclusion of the game  i have spoken to louis  his parents  and to oregon s head coach dana altman   they have graciously accepted my explanation and apology  <BRK> i take seriously my responsibility as a campus and community leader  and i regret that my actions during the oregon game did not meet the standard of leadership i should consistently set  for that  i apologize to the uc irvine community  including the student athletes and coaches of our men s basketball program   when student athletes on our team make mistakes  i expect them to take responsibility and to learn from their mistakes in order to improve themselves   i will do the same   i accept full responsibility for my ill considered actions  and i will learn from this situation to be a more thoughtful coach and competitor  <BRK> while it s important that turner called the direct target of his taunts  he did absolutely nothing to acknowledge the harm words like his cause gay  bisexual  trans and queer boys and young men  some of whom may be on his team or coaching staff  on the oregon team or staff  or fans who had to endure his nonsense  <BRK>  it s great to see coach russel apologize   said openly gay basketball coach anthony nicodemo  who was one of the first voices to speak out about the coach s taunting   but does he understand why it was wrong  it sets a dangerous precedent to athletes that this type of bullying is okay  i d love the opportunity to have that discussion with coach russell  <BRK> one response to uc irvine s tweet of turner s statement might bring the gravity of the implication of the coach s language into focus  <BRK> nope   kids are killing themselves over sh t like this  <BRK> no  this is not the  absurd  response of a  snowflake   people in the lgbtq community   and in particular in sports   have quietly felt the heartbreaking impact of this kind of language for generations   <BRK> the problem with the taunting by a   year old coach of a   year old player isn t just the age difference or the surface level unsportsmanlike conduct that deserved a technical foul  <BRK> calling an opposing male player a  queen    whether the player s last name is king or prince or smith   tells everyone in earshot that being feminine is wrong  being associated with a woman is weak  and in the minds of closeted young lgbtq men in the stands  on the bench and dribbling on the court  it tells them they do not belong anywhere in that arena  <BRK> turner s apology to king was a non apology to the lgbtq community and  frankly  a non apology to the wider uc irvine community that long ago decided this kind of language has no place on campus or as part of the anteater community  <BRK> while some people  like martina navratilova  want to see turner fired  i prescribe a different path forward for coach turner  uc irvine  and any men s basketball program with any interest in hiring him  <BRK>    speak with lgbtq people in and out of sports who can give the coach a true understanding of this kind of behavior  he might start with anthony nicodemo  former nba player jason collins  and lgbtq people on campus  <BRK>    invite a professional in the space to work with turner  his staff and other coaching staffs at uc irvine to  <BRK>    talk publicly about the impact of his words on the lgbtq community  and reaffirm his commitment to regularly build a more inclusive environment on his team   <BRK> i personally don t think firing people for mistakes should be the first step  people can make mistakes  and allowing them to make amends can yield incredible results  failing that  of course  may take more drastic measures   <BRK> hopefully coach turner will spend the next couple of weeks bettering himself  his coaching staff  and his team  even as he s in the conversation for more high profile jobs elsewhere  <BRK>
