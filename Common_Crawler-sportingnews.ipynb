The only blemish on his ledger was a September 2013 loss to Floyd Mayweather Jr. — something that Alvarez has attributed to inexperience, as he was just 23 at the time.Since that loss, Alvarez has gone 9-0-1, with the draw coming in his first clash with “GGG,” before walking Golovkin down and scoring a unanimous decision win in their grudge match. Alvarez has shown the ability to box and punch with knockout power from all angles, with improved defense as well. The Villanova Wildcats reigned supreme in March Madness, so gear up for the champs with our wide range of NCAA Basketball Apparel including official Villanova National Champs Gear that allow Wildcats fans to ring in their second title in three years!

Previously, she spent 12 years as producer with SNY television in New York where she won four Emmy Awards.The Road to Wrestlemania has become a symbolic journey for countless WWE superstars. The gap between Royal Rumble and the biggest show of the year has long been a space of activity where WWE's creative force thread together a number of storylines in the hope that a massive payoff arrives when the big show gets underway in spring. A central part of that build-up is the February PPV, either No Way Out, and most recently the Elimination Chamber, and with 2019's version on the horizon, Sporting News takes a look back at some of the event's most memorable moments.No Way Out 2004 was designed to achieve two things: Give Eddie Guerrero his moment in the spotlight and promote the Wrestlemania dream match between Brock Lesnar and Bill Goldberg. All of this was achieved in one match as one of wrestling's hardest workers was finally rewarded with the company's top prize after years of professional and personal heartbreak.Join DAZN and watch Joshua vs. Miller on June 1Booked as the underdog from the opening bell, Guerrero sold for Lesnar like his life depended on it as the contrasting pair took fans on an unforgettable journey that was laced with hope, emotion, and drama. The contemporary version of Lesnar that modern fans can relate to was evident in this match as he gave Guerrero an almighty beating for the bulk of the contest.Not one to be deterred, Guerrero fought back valiantly, and although the crowd's darling required the assistance of an interfering Goldberg, the noise that greeted him when climbing the ropes to perform his frog splash finisher was deafening. Guerrero typically took advantage of Lesnar's misfortune by hitting the aerial move on the stricken Minnesotan and becoming WWE champion for the first and only time in one of WWE's most heart-warming moments.At Wrestlemania 25 in 2009, Shawn Michaels and The Undertaker delivered an impeccable classic that is rightly regarded as one of Wrestlemania's greatest ever matches. With the man from Death Valley taking the win and maintaining his undefeated streak at the event, Michaels was left to rue a missed opportunity and he was desperate to put it right at the following year's event.After his demands of a rematch were rebuffed by The Undertaker, Michaels entered the 2010 Royal Rumble and intended to challenge his long-time nemesis for his world heavyweight title, but after being eliminated he would need to come up with an altogether different plan to lure The Undertaker into a second Wrestlemania showdown. Michaels would carry out his strategy at The Elimination Chamber PPV in February.Left with Chris Jericho as one half of the final two, and carrying horrific injuries after accidentally being burnt by his entrance pyrotechnic show, Undertaker looked set to retain his belt with Jericho seemingly beat, but Michaels had other ideas. He emerged from underneath the steel structure and attacked the battered Undertaker with Sweet Chin Music allowing Jericho the opportunity to go for the pin. Undertaker had lost his title, but he finally agreed to give Michaels a shot at redemption as they met again at Wrestlemania 26 where Taker repeated the victory and ended Michaels' career.Fans of WWE during the critically acclaimed Attitude Era did not see Stone Cold Steve Austin lose clean often. Like Hulk Hogan a couple of generations before, WWE's hero either side of the new millennium was protected at all costs and if the time did arrive for him to have his shoulders pinned then you can wager that it would be surrounded in controversy and a ton of handicapping factors. Things were different at No Way Out in 2001.After carrying the company for the bulk of 2000, along with The Rock, HHH was relegated in the pecking order as Austin, the face of the company since 1998, made his long-awaited return from injury. Winning the Royal Rumble in January, Austin was set to head to Wrestlemania to face The Rock, but along the way, he had to settle a feud with HHH, a rivalry that was intended to be reignited following Wrestlemania when The Rock was off to Hollywood.In a match that was essentially a gimmicked 2 out of 3 falls match, HHH took the victory in the final stage that took place inside a steel cage and the result, the right call from a booking perspective, left audiences shocked. HHH and Austin would align the night after Wrestlemania as a heel duo guided by Vince McMahon, but their alliance was short-lived as HHH tore his quad the following month and would not return until the following year. A host of grand plans were shelved, but the initial seeds for them were planted at No Way Out.HHH's rivalry with Mick Foley at the backend of 1999 leading into the following year was arguably the most important work of both men's careers. HHH was the recipient of a massive push dating back to SummerSlam 99, but his work with a host of wrestlers before Foley lacked the desired effect that was required to make the former leader of DX a star all by himself. He finally became that star with two stunning back to back PPV performances alongside Foley that culminated with the latter placing his career on the line at No Way Out 2000.After stealing the show at the previous month's Royal Rumble, the pair delivered another classic inside Hell in a Cell as HHH ensured he was heading to Wrestlemania every bit the main event performer he believed he was. This near half-hour battle moved in many directions, but it was the crafty HHH that stole the victory and hobbled onto Wrestlemania as the crowd stayed behind to applaud Foley for what everyone assumed was his final match. The stipulation carried no leverage and Foley was back wrestling the following month as he made up one-quarter of Wrestlemania's four-man main event. Six years after their formation in WCW, the original three members of the NWO -- Hulk Hogan, Kevin Nash and Scott Hall -- arrived in WWE less than three months after the botched invasion angle had concluded. Despite previous backstage grumbles about the faction's disruptive behavior, Vince McMahon took a gamble on his previous employees and brought them back as the characters they had excellently portrayed whilst working for Eric Bischoff, but it was obvious early on that the trio's original magic had faded horribly.With the exception of Hogan, who turned face just weeks afterward at Wrestlemania 18, the whole NWO in WWE experiment was an embarrassment from the start. Hall's personal life had a massive impact on his professional conduct, Nash could barely move, and WWE fans, ardent disciples of Hogan, could not tolerate their former hero as a cowardly heel.Although greeted with excitement in the beginning, it became apparent early on that the same three men who transformed the fortunes of wrestling's iconic television rivalry in the mid-90s were not going to make a similar splash in an altogether alternative landscape. In the end, WWE fans were treated to one last nostalgic Hogan run that included a memorable match with The Rock played out in front of one of wrestling's rowdiest crowds, and it was No Way Out 2002 that provided that platform.Manuel Neuer acknowledged that Bayern Munich must improve in defence if they are to stand a chance of progressing past Liverpool in the Champions League.Neuer returned to Bayern's team on Friday, following a three-game absence due to a thumb injury, but conceded after just 13 seconds in the 3-2 Bundesliga win over Augsburg when Leon Goretzka deflected into his own net.Watch Champions League | Soccer Live Streaming | DAZN CAIt was the fastest own goal in Bundesliga history, leaving the club with an early hill to climb. Kingsley Coman - who went off injured late on - restored parity and the France winger again levelled when Augsburg went back ahead courtesy of Ji Dong-won.David Alaba's second-half goal proved the winner for the German giants, who closed the gap on league leaders Dortmund to just two points, though their rivals will hold a game in hand until they take the pitch on Monday against Nuremberg​. But Neuer was not pleased with how his club played at the back and says Bayern must cut out on the \"madness\", especially if they are to come away with anything from the first leg of their Champions League last-16 clash with Jurgen Klopp's side at Anfield on Tuesday.\"The game was all great, but conceding the goals was, of course, madness,\" Neuer told reporters. \"You cannot do that.\"We wanted to keep a clean sheet again, the good thing was that we still had time after the 1-0.2 - @FCA_World have scored more than once against FC Bayern for the first time in the #Bundesliga , in what is their 16th game. Dreamland. #FCAFCB pic.twitter.com/hGofY4tWGA\"Liverpool will have more chances to score. We were caught cold twice on the wings, we need to stand better, occupy the box better and organise ourselves very well, especially with passes over the side so we can prevent that.\"While Neuer was annoyed, manager  Niko Kovac​ floated the belief that his side might have been overlooking their opponent on the day with a clash against the Premier League side looming. The injury to Coman will also come as a blow as the club enter a busy time, with matches against top half clubs Hertha, Borussia Monchengladbach and Wolfsburg all on tap between the first leg against Liverpool on Tuesday and the return leg on March 13. Conor Coady and Matt Doherty have signed contract extensions with Wolves until June 2023, the Premier League club have confirmed.Stars of Wolves' Championship promotion campaign, club captain Coady and wing-back Doherty have excelled in the top flight under Nuno Espirito Santo.EUROPEAN SOCCER LIVE & IN HD ON DAZN | DAZN CALiverpool academy graduate Coady, 25, has been an ever-present, with Wolves seventh in the Premier League table, while 27-year-old Doherty brought up his 200th league appearance earlier this season for a club he joined from Bohemians in 2010.\"Everybody knows how much I love being here. As soon as the club came to me and told me about the situation I wanted to get something signed as soon as possible,\" Coady told Wolves' official website.\"I love coming here every day, I love coming in to train, I love playing games, I love being part of this football club.\"To get it done and be sorted is fantastic, it's great for me and my family to be part of this football club for four more years.\"Republic of Ireland international Doherty told the club website how he and Coady could reflect on an impressive journey playing alongside one another.\"Me and Coads have both been here a long time now, but we still think about the times we were in the Championship and losing at home to Wigan,\" he said.\"The place was half-empty, and you'd get booed off - rightly so for some of the performances that we were putting in.\"Looking at how we've progressed to what the club is now, especially as it's not that long ago; maybe two, two-and-a-half years, and I think a lot of credit has to go to the manager, his backroom staff and the players for the efforts they've put in.\"Wolves travel to Bristol City in the fifth round of the FA Cup on Sunday and return to Premier League action at Bournemouth six days later.Harry Wilson is determined to be a \"Liverpool player\", with a loan spell at Derby having seen him make it clear where his allegiances lie during a memorable outing against Manchester United.The 21-year-old playmaker was allowed to head out of Anfield in the summer of 2018 on a season-long agreement.EUROPEAN SOCCER LIVE & IN HD ON DAZN | DAZN CAHe was tied to a new five-year contract before a deal was struck that allowed him to form part of an ambitious project being pieced together by Frank Lampard at Pride Park.Wilson has impressed during his time at Derby, alongside fellow youngster and Premier League hopeful Mason Mount of Chelsea, and is convinced that he has a future on Merseyside.He told the Daily Mail: \"The main focus this season is to get promoted with Derby.\"But Mason's goal is to play for Chelsea and my goal is to play for Liverpool. I have always felt like a Liverpool player. Everything is going along the right path.\"Wilson has already become the youngest player to represent Wales at senior level when making his bow as a 16-year-old against Belgium in October 2013.He is now seeing regular football at Derby and has recorded 10 goals and two assists in the Championship this season.A notable strike was also delivered during a Carabao Cup clash with Manchester United in September, as he crashed home a spectacular free-kick.Wilson said of that effort, which saw him celebrate by holding five fingers up to the home support in reference to Liverpool's collection of European Cup triumphs: \"I didn't realise the goal at United was as good as it was because I went off celebrating.\"It wasn't until I was on the bus on the way back here that I watched it on Twitter and saw the movement that I had got on it. With it being at Old Trafford made it even more special.\"Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp was among those left impressed by an eye-catching outing at Old Trafford and the German has remained in contact with Wilson throughout his time at Derby.\"He dropped me a text to tell me he'd watched it and he was delighted with the performance - and the goal!\" Wilson added on his dealings with those back at Anfield.\"A couple of weeks ago there was another message saying, 'Good result, good goal - keep going'. When you get those texts, it is a massive boost. You know you aren't forgotten.\"Tiger Woods begins his quest for Masters victory No. 5 on Thursday.
