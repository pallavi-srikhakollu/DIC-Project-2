          While Green said he's ready to play, Hobson notes that the receiver is expected to be eased back into action just four months removed from undergoing a surgical procedure that was initially believed to require a three-to-four month timetable for recovery.                       -- RotoWire.com

          Kershaw made his second minor-league rehab start Tuesday at Double-A Tulsa, tossing 81 pitches while striking out six over six innings of two-run ball. The Dodgers were apparently satisfied with how Kershaw's shoulder responded to the outing, so he'll re-enter the big-league rotation as the effective replacement for the injured Hyun-Jin Ryu (groin).                       -- RotoWire.com

          This is a good sign that Bruce should be able return to the lineup in the coming days. He is an excellent pinch-hitting option against right-handed pitchers, so it would not be surprising to see him get at least one at-bat in this day game.                      -- RotoWire.com

          Senzel was recently cleared to shed his walking boot and resume working out, but he'll likely need until late April to work through a full progression of activities before the Reds clear him for action in simulated or rehab games. The Reds will likely ease Senzel into a rehab assignment by first sending him to a lower-level affiliate before he eventually makes his way to Triple-A Louisville, where he finished the past season.                       -- RotoWire.com

The only blemish on his ledger was a September 2013 loss to Floyd Mayweather Jr. — something that Alvarez has attributed to inexperience, as he was just 23 at the time.Since that loss, Alvarez has gone 9-0-1, with the draw coming in his first clash with “GGG,” before walking Golovkin down and scoring a unanimous decision win in their grudge match. Alvarez has shown the ability to box and punch with knockout power from all angles, with improved defense as well. Sporting News previews Nebraska's schedule, roster, recruiting and storylines ahead of the 2019 college football season.Sporting News previews Tennessee's schedule, roster, recruiting and storylines ahead of the 2019 college football season.Sporting News previews USC's schedule, roster, recruiting and storylines ahead of the 2019 college football season.We noticed you're in .

          While Green said he's ready to play, Hobson notes that the receiver is expected to be eased back into action just four months removed from undergoing a surgical procedure that was initially believed to require a three-to-four month timetable for recovery.                       -- RotoWire.com

          Kershaw made his second minor-league rehab start Tuesday at Double-A Tulsa, tossing 81 pitches while striking out six over six innings of two-run ball. The Dodgers were apparently satisfied with how Kershaw's shoulder responded to the outing, so he'll re-enter the big-league rotation as the effective replacement for the injured Hyun-Jin Ryu (groin).                       -- RotoWire.com

          This is a good sign that Bruce should be able return to the lineup in the coming days. He is an excellent pinch-hitting option against right-handed pitchers, so it would not be surprising to see him get at least one at-bat in this day game.                      -- RotoWire.com

          Senzel was recently cleared to shed his walking boot and resume working out, but he'll likely need until late April to work through a full progression of activities before the Reds clear him for action in simulated or rehab games. The Reds will likely ease Senzel into a rehab assignment by first sending him to a lower-level affiliate before he eventually makes his way to Triple-A Louisville, where he finished the past season.                       -- RotoWire.com

The only blemish on his ledger was a September 2013 loss to Floyd Mayweather Jr. — something that Alvarez has attributed to inexperience, as he was just 23 at the time.Since that loss, Alvarez has gone 9-0-1, with the draw coming in his first clash with “GGG,” before walking Golovkin down and scoring a unanimous decision win in their grudge match. Alvarez has shown the ability to box and punch with knockout power from all angles, with improved defense as well. Sporting News previews Nebraska's schedule, roster, recruiting and storylines ahead of the 2019 college football season.Sporting News previews Tennessee's schedule, roster, recruiting and storylines ahead of the 2019 college football season.Sporting News previews USC's schedule, roster, recruiting and storylines ahead of the 2019 college football season.We noticed you're in .

Previously, she spent 12 years as producer with SNY television in New York where she won four Emmy Awards.The Road to Wrestlemania has become a symbolic journey for countless WWE superstars. The gap between Royal Rumble and the biggest show of the year has long been a space of activity where WWE's creative force thread together a number of storylines in the hope that a massive payoff arrives when the big show gets underway in spring. A central part of that build-up is the February PPV, either No Way Out, and most recently the Elimination Chamber, and with 2019's version on the horizon, Sporting News takes a look back at some of the event's most memorable moments.No Way Out 2004 was designed to achieve two things: Give Eddie Guerrero his moment in the spotlight and promote the Wrestlemania dream match between Brock Lesnar and Bill Goldberg. All of this was achieved in one match as one of wrestling's hardest workers was finally rewarded with the company's top prize after years of professional and personal heartbreak.Join DAZN and watch Joshua vs. Miller on June 1Booked as the underdog from the opening bell, Guerrero sold for Lesnar like his life depended on it as the contrasting pair took fans on an unforgettable journey that was laced with hope, emotion, and drama. The contemporary version of Lesnar that modern fans can relate to was evident in this match as he gave Guerrero an almighty beating for the bulk of the contest.Not one to be deterred, Guerrero fought back valiantly, and although the crowd's darling required the assistance of an interfering Goldberg, the noise that greeted him when climbing the ropes to perform his frog splash finisher was deafening. Guerrero typically took advantage of Lesnar's misfortune by hitting the aerial move on the stricken Minnesotan and becoming WWE champion for the first and only time in one of WWE's most heart-warming moments.At Wrestlemania 25 in 2009, Shawn Michaels and The Undertaker delivered an impeccable classic that is rightly regarded as one of Wrestlemania's greatest ever matches. With the man from Death Valley taking the win and maintaining his undefeated streak at the event, Michaels was left to rue a missed opportunity and he was desperate to put it right at the following year's event.After his demands of a rematch were rebuffed by The Undertaker, Michaels entered the 2010 Royal Rumble and intended to challenge his long-time nemesis for his world heavyweight title, but after being eliminated he would need to come up with an altogether different plan to lure The Undertaker into a second Wrestlemania showdown. Michaels would carry out his strategy at The Elimination Chamber PPV in February.Left with Chris Jericho as one half of the final two, and carrying horrific injuries after accidentally being burnt by his entrance pyrotechnic show, Undertaker looked set to retain his belt with Jericho seemingly beat, but Michaels had other ideas. He emerged from underneath the steel structure and attacked the battered Undertaker with Sweet Chin Music allowing Jericho the opportunity to go for the pin. Undertaker had lost his title, but he finally agreed to give Michaels a shot at redemption as they met again at Wrestlemania 26 where Taker repeated the victory and ended Michaels' career.Fans of WWE during the critically acclaimed Attitude Era did not see Stone Cold Steve Austin lose clean often. Like Hulk Hogan a couple of generations before, WWE's hero either side of the new millennium was protected at all costs and if the time did arrive for him to have his shoulders pinned then you can wager that it would be surrounded in controversy and a ton of handicapping factors. Things were different at No Way Out in 2001.After carrying the company for the bulk of 2000, along with The Rock, HHH was relegated in the pecking order as Austin, the face of the company since 1998, made his long-awaited return from injury. Winning the Royal Rumble in January, Austin was set to head to Wrestlemania to face The Rock, but along the way, he had to settle a feud with HHH, a rivalry that was intended to be reignited following Wrestlemania when The Rock was off to Hollywood.In a match that was essentially a gimmicked 2 out of 3 falls match, HHH took the victory in the final stage that took place inside a steel cage and the result, the right call from a booking perspective, left audiences shocked. HHH and Austin would align the night after Wrestlemania as a heel duo guided by Vince McMahon, but their alliance was short-lived as HHH tore his quad the following month and would not return until the following year. A host of grand plans were shelved, but the initial seeds for them were planted at No Way Out.HHH's rivalry with Mick Foley at the backend of 1999 leading into the following year was arguably the most important work of both men's careers. HHH was the recipient of a massive push dating back to SummerSlam 99, but his work with a host of wrestlers before Foley lacked the desired effect that was required to make the former leader of DX a star all by himself. He finally became that star with two stunning back to back PPV performances alongside Foley that culminated with the latter placing his career on the line at No Way Out 2000.After stealing the show at the previous month's Royal Rumble, the pair delivered another classic inside Hell in a Cell as HHH ensured he was heading to Wrestlemania every bit the main event performer he believed he was. This near half-hour battle moved in many directions, but it was the crafty HHH that stole the victory and hobbled onto Wrestlemania as the crowd stayed behind to applaud Foley for what everyone assumed was his final match. The stipulation carried no leverage and Foley was back wrestling the following month as he made up one-quarter of Wrestlemania's four-man main event. Six years after their formation in WCW, the original three members of the NWO -- Hulk Hogan, Kevin Nash and Scott Hall -- arrived in WWE less than three months after the botched invasion angle had concluded. Despite previous backstage grumbles about the faction's disruptive behavior, Vince McMahon took a gamble on his previous employees and brought them back as the characters they had excellently portrayed whilst working for Eric Bischoff, but it was obvious early on that the trio's original magic had faded horribly.With the exception of Hogan, who turned face just weeks afterward at Wrestlemania 18, the whole NWO in WWE experiment was an embarrassment from the start. Hall's personal life had a massive impact on his professional conduct, Nash could barely move, and WWE fans, ardent disciples of Hogan, could not tolerate their former hero as a cowardly heel.Although greeted with excitement in the beginning, it became apparent early on that the same three men who transformed the fortunes of wrestling's iconic television rivalry in the mid-90s were not going to make a similar splash in an altogether alternative landscape. In the end, WWE fans were treated to one last nostalgic Hogan run that included a memorable match with The Rock played out in front of one of wrestling's rowdiest crowds, and it was No Way Out 2002 that provided that platform.The Road to Wrestlemania has become a symbolic journey for countless WWE superstars.

Kingsley Coman - who went off injured late on - restored parity and the France winger again levelled when Augsburg went back ahead courtesy of Ji Dong-won.David Alaba's second-half goal proved the winner for the German giants, who closed the gap on league leaders Dortmund to just two points, though their rivals will hold a game in hand until they take the pitch on Monday against Nuremberg​. But Neuer was not pleased with how his club played at the back and says Bayern must cut out on the "madness", especially if they are to come away with anything from the first leg of their Champions League last-16 clash with Jurgen Klopp's side at Anfield on Tuesday."The game was all great, but conceding the goals was, of course, madness," Neuer told reporters. "You cannot do that."We wanted to keep a clean sheet again, the good thing was that we still had time after the 1-0.2 - @FCA_World have scored more than once against FC Bayern for the first time in the #Bundesliga , in what is their 16th game.

Everything is going along the right path."Wilson has already become the youngest player to represent Wales at senior level when making his bow as a 16-year-old against Belgium in October 2013.He is now seeing regular football at Derby and has recorded 10 goals and two assists in the Championship this season.A notable strike was also delivered during a Carabao Cup clash with Manchester United in September, as he crashed home a spectacular free-kick.Wilson said of that effort, which saw him celebrate by holding five fingers up to the home support in reference to Liverpool's collection of European Cup triumphs: "I didn't realise the goal at United was as good as it was because I went off celebrating."It wasn't until I was on the bus on the way back here that I watched it on Twitter and saw the movement that I had got on it. With it being at Old Trafford made it even more special."Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp was among those left impressed by an eye-catching outing at Old Trafford and the German has remained in contact with Wilson throughout his time at Derby."He dropped me a text to tell me he'd watched it and he was delighted with the performance - and the goal!" Wilson added on his dealings with those back at Anfield."A couple of weeks ago there was another message saying, 'Good result, good goal - keep going'. When you get those texts, it is a massive boost. You know you aren't forgotten."Tiger Woods begins his quest for Masters victory No. 5 on Thursday.

Perform Media ("we", "us" or "Perform Media") is a business division of the Perform Group, headquartered in the UK.  Perform Media is a group of companies within the Perform Group which own, operate (either for ourselves or on behalf of third-parties) or represent a number of free-to-use digital sports media properties, which are either websites or mobile applications.  We also operate a video-content streaming service called ePlayer, which allows third-party digital publishers to stream sports video content on their own digital platforms.  In this notice, each of the properties and ePlayer platforms is referred to as a "platform".  When we refer to the "Service" in this Privacy Notice, this means the provision of the content on the platforms to the user.This notice explains why Perform Media collects information concerning the users of the platforms (each a "user", "you" or “your”), what type of information we collect and how we use that information.  This Privacy Notice applies to any such information collected via any platform which displays it (or a link to it). Additional information for users located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) about their rights and other information can be found in the Annex to this Privacy Notice. This notice has been last updated on 25 May 2018.When a user interacts with any of the platforms, Perform Media may collect certain data about that user.  This data falls into 2 broad categories: (i) data about a user themselves, which the user gives us; and (ii) data about the user, or the way a user interacts with the platforms or Services, which is collected by us electronically (collectively "User Information").Some examples of User Information include:We may also collect personal information from a variety of third-party sources.  These include social networks (subject to the user's privacy settings and the privacy policy of the social network), service providers which allow us to verify, enhance or supplement the User Information collected on our platforms, and business partners to whom we are offering a service.We use the User Information for three main purposes: (i) to operate and improve the platforms and to ensure that we can provide the Services; (ii) to optimise the content on the platforms; and (iii) send marketing and show advertising to our users.More specifically, we will use the User Information to do one or more of the following things:The digital sports media platforms we operate are designed to attract as many users as possible.  In our case, our users are typically sports fans or interested in sports news and other sports-related content.

We have a legitimate interest in ensuring that we deliver this advertising in a responsible way, and in allowing us to deliver it to the users most likely to be interested in it, and in doing so we employ User Information, such as the user's location, how the user engages with the platforms and the content that the user views.More specifically, in relation to advertising:Much of the User Information that we collect, and most of the information we employ in connection with advertising, is obtained via the use of cookies and similar technologies.

Perform Media ("we", "us" or "Perform Media") is a business division of the Perform Group, headquartered in the UK.  Perform Media is a group of companies within the Perform Group which own, operate (either for ourselves or on behalf of third-parties) or represent a number of free-to-use digital sports media properties, which are either websites or mobile applications.  We also operate a video-content streaming service called ePlayer, which allows third-party digital publishers to stream sports video content on their own digital platforms.  In this notice, each of the properties and ePlayer platforms is referred to as a "platform".  When we refer to the "Service" in this Privacy Notice, this means the provision of the content on the platforms to the user.This notice explains why Perform Media collects information concerning the users of the platforms (each a "user", "you" or “your”), what type of information we collect and how we use that information.  This Privacy Notice applies to any such information collected via any platform which displays it (or a link to it). Additional information for users located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) about their rights and other information can be found in the Annex to this Privacy Notice. This notice has been last updated on 25 May 2018.When a user interacts with any of the platforms, Perform Media may collect certain data about that user.  This data falls into 2 broad categories: (i) data about a user themselves, which the user gives us; and (ii) data about the user, or the way a user interacts with the platforms or Services, which is collected by us electronically (collectively "User Information").Some examples of User Information include:We may also collect personal information from a variety of third-party sources.  These include social networks (subject to the user's privacy settings and the privacy policy of the social network), service providers which allow us to verify, enhance or supplement the User Information collected on our platforms, and business partners to whom we are offering a service.We use the User Information for three main purposes: (i) to operate and improve the platforms and to ensure that we can provide the Services; (ii) to optimise the content on the platforms; and (iii) send marketing and show advertising to our users.More specifically, we will use the User Information to do one or more of the following things:The digital sports media platforms we operate are designed to attract as many users as possible.  In our case, our users are typically sports fans or interested in sports news and other sports-related content.  The creation of this content, and the work that goes into ensuring that the platforms continue to be class-leading digital sports destinations, are funded by advertising revenues which we receive as a result of showing users advertising or other sponsored or branded content on the platforms.  We have a legitimate interest in ensuring that we deliver this advertising in a responsible way, and in allowing us to deliver it to the users most likely to be interested in it, and in doing so we employ User Information, such as the user's location, how the user engages with the platforms and the content that the user views.More specifically, in relation to advertising:Much of the User Information that we collect, and most of the information we employ in connection with advertising, is obtained via the use of cookies and similar technologies.  Cookies are usually a string of numbers and/or letters that a website transfers to a User's hard drive. Similar technologies include pixel tags and web storage and other technologies, and we refer to all these things as “cookies” in this section. The cookies enable the platforms to "remember" you, either for the duration of your visit (session cookies) or for repeat visits (persistent cookies).On this platform, we use the following types of cookies:These types of cookies may also be placed on the platform by our business partners or service providers.If you register with us or if you continue to use our platforms, you agree to our use of cookies.

You may not be able to take full advantage of our platforms or use certain functions if you disable cookies.We may share User Information with any member of the Perform group (www.performgroup.com/).  We may also allow other members of the Perform group to contact users with relevant offers, competitions and latest news (where they have consented to doing so, if required by applicable laws).We may also share User Information with selected third parties including:Where relevant, we will disclose User Information and anonymized information associated with a user's use of and interaction with the platforms to the partner on whose behalf we operate that platform, for the purposes of marketing and advertising, and to promote their own products and services.If you would like us to stop sending you marketing communications you may use the opt-out link here, the unsubscribe link in our marketing communications or by amending your app settings. Although we encourage you to use the opt-out link and App settings because it is automated, you may also contact us here.If you, or another user of your device, wish to withdraw your cookies consent at any time, you have the ability to accept or decline cookies by modifying your browser setting. You may also go to www.allaboutcookies.org or www.youronlinechoices.eu if you are in Europe, or to www.aboutads.info/choices if you are anywhere else for instructions on how to disable cookies. You may opt-out from Google Analytics here. In some instances, when you opt-out, a new cookie (Opt-Out-Cookie) is placed in your web browser. This tells the third party provider to cease data collection from your browser and prevents advertisements from being delivered to you.Users in the EU can adjust their third-party cookie consent settings here.We understand that the security of your User Information is important to you.
