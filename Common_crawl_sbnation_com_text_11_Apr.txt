The surprising part? No one is talking about him.Executives around the league aren’t holding back on their opinions of current Lakers general manager Rob Pelinka.If the Lakers fire Luke Walton, he already has interest from the Kings, who just parted ways with head coach Dave Joerger.The Lakers already have interest from two valuable impending free agents. Now they just have to decide if they want to keep JaVale McGee and Reggie Bullock.Multiple reliable NBA insiders have speculated about Warriors team president and general manager Bob Myers being a potential target to replace Magic Johnson with the Lakers, but it still seems unlikely for a few reasons.At Lakers exit interviews, Brandon Ingram gave an update on his health, how he felt his season went and more.Kyle Kuzma proved his doubters wrong this season, but he believes he’s just getting started with the Lakers.While things are obviously turbulent right now, Lonzo Ball says he took advantage of his relationships with LeBron James and Magic Johnson while he could.Magic Johnson deciding to step down caught LeBron James off guard, but he’s not ready to push the panic button for the Lakers just yet.If the Lakers really do believe injuries were all that derailed this season, they had to make this move and revamp their medical staff. It’s worth wondering if more changes could be comingIt sounds like Rob Pelinka isn’t going anywhere and there’s a possibility that he’ll step into a larger role with the Lakers now that Magic Johnson is gone.Luke Walton cannot afford to be this stubborn about his coaching staff. If he remains as such, the Lakers would be wise to show him the same door Magic Johnson walked through.Jemerrio Jones did his best to help the Lakers down the stretch, but there was really no other way for this season to end than with a buzzer-beating punch below the belt.The Lakers said they "will work in a measured and methodical fashion" as they move forward after Magic Johnson announced that he was resigning on the final night of the NBA season.On one hand, the Lakers are devoid of leadership abruptly and without warning. On the other, they have an opportunity that has literally never been granted before.At an impromptu press conference before the final Lakers game of the 2018-19 season, Magic Johnson announced he would not be continuing on as the team’s president of basketball operations.The Lakers will play their final game of the season and Luke Walton could realistically coach his last game for the purple and gold.This is now a few stories where it seems Rob Pelinka just outright lied when he didn’t have to, and it paints the Lakers in a really bad light.Other than Magic Johnson not speaking to Luke Walton and maybe not being around that much, though, things are totally normal with the Lakers. Nothing to see here!LeBron James is hours away from being done with his first Lakers season. Let’s look back on it as an experience, and look ahead to how things can get better.
        Los Angeles area events happening soon:
      Spearheaded by a spirited cast of G League players and rookies, the Lakers have unfathomably knocked off two playoff teams in their last two games, but in the process have also lowered their lottery odds. This is fine.Magic Johnson really considered Jabari Parker reinforcements for LeBron James. The Lakers really might be in trouble.Luke Walton was seen as a dead man walking for most of this season. But if the Lakers bring him back these would be the reasons why.Apparently, all the Lakers needed to do was pretend they could ruin someone else’s day in order to play better down the stretch when it mattered.Before the Lakers and Golden State Warriors faced off at Staples Center, Steph Curry and Steve Kerr shared their thoughts on Luke Walton.Brandon Ingram isn’t doing any basketball activities and hasn’t been around the Lakers yet since his surgery, but Luke Walton has been in contact with him and empathizes with what he’s going through.A season mired in disappointment is ending on a bright note, as the South Bay Lakers have shown what passion for the game looks like. Luke Walton has enjoyed this greatly.The Lakers seem to have unearthed a couple diamonds in the rough in Alex Caruso and Jemerrio Jones. They have to take advantage.The Lakers have also enjoyed having Jemerrio Jones on their team, as the undersized guard’s unorthodox game draws comparisons to Tony Allen and more.It sounds like despite the season ending early for the Lakers, LeBron James won’t be using any of his extra offseason to head to the FIBA World Cup. He might play for Gregg Popovich in the 2020 Olympics, however.It sounds like unless the Lakers have a ton of injuries or massive foul trouble, Tyson Chandler and Rajon Rondo are done for the year.Contract Kenny could not miss in the fourth quarter and helped the Lakers bury the playoff-bound Jazz.This Lakers season has been a funhouse mirror image of the Clippers, and that may continue into the offseason.The Lakers didn’t live up to their lofty expectations this season, and LeBron James believes their struggles started with his injury.Lakers controlling owner Jeanie Buss has put the pressure on Magic Johnson to deliver in free agency this summer.In spite of the lack of success the Lakers had, JaVale McGee saw this as a fruitful season for him.We out here Zo!

             The St. Louis Cardinals announced a mysterious press conference for today at 3:00pm. Since everyone is signing extensions nowadays, that seemed to be the popular guess as to the reason. Turns out we were right. At the press conference the Cardinals announced they have agreed to a contract extension with Matt Carpenter.  
 The Cardinals drafted Carpenter back in 2009 and he has been with the team ever since, making his debut in 2011. In 2012 he got his first real taste in the big leagues as the Cardinals toughest bench bat. He broke out for real in 2013 and has not looked back. In eight seasons with the Birdos he has amassed 28.5 fWAR and put up a 132 wRC+. 2019 marks his age 33 season, keeping him a Cardinal until he is at least 35, hopefully 36 (because that would mean he has played well enough to trigger the vesting option).
