 <BRK>  <BRK> on baseball <BRK> by tyler kepner <BRK> surprise  ariz    after the kansa city royal departed for a spring training road game last month  their general manager  dayton moore  stayed behind at the team s training complex to watch prospect on the back field  it wa from there  more than a decade ago  that a longtime coach  bill fischer  had called him excitedly to share a vision  <BRK>  fish said   i just saw the latin version of johnny bench    moore said  sitting in a dugout and smiling at the memory   i said   who s that   he said   salvador perez   fish recognized it right away   <BRK> bench may have been the greatest catcher ever  but perez is the only other catcher to make at least six all star team while winning five gold glove and a world series most valuable player award  <BRK> he is a rare modern specie  a high impact offensive catcher who play a lot of game  <BRK> a recently a      player appeared in at leat   game a a catcher  lat seaon that number had dwindled to    the fewest since the major expanded to   team in    perez did it for the sixth seaon in a row  but his streak will end in    at the moment moore spoke  perez wa in los angeles to undergo tommy john surgery  which will cost him the seaon  <BRK>  it s a big blow to the morale of the organization  because salvy s our energy giver out there   moore said   the fan adore him  and they show up to watch him play regardless of where we are in the standing   <BRK> without perez   who hit   homer in each of the last two season   catcher  offensive production could slip again this season  in    major league catcher produced a    batting average and a    on base plus slugging percentage  both the lowest figure of the   team era  <BRK>  it s a very physically demanding position  but that s been true for year   said matt klentak  the general manager of the philadelphia phillies   on top of that  there ha been a shift throughout the league in recent year in the way catcher defense is evaluated  prioritizing catcher framing  the impact of framing on a game is real  and in some case team are willing to trade out some offense in exchange for better receiving skill   <BRK> catcher who can hit are still valued  a evidenced the phillies  trade with the miami marlin for j  t  realmuto  the game s best offensive catcher  but the boston red sox showed lat seaon that a slugger behind the plate is not always necessary  they won the world series despite a    average and    o p s  from their catcher  the worst mark for any champion in the live ball era  <BRK>  we look at catcher a a defensive position   said dave dombrowski  boston s president of baeball operation   and so the defensive efficiency they bring to u  not only the thing you can meaure with framing  throwing guy out and time to second bae  but handling the staff  following the game plan that we want   we put a high priority on that   <BRK> and the job is only getting more challenging  team use more pitcher per season than ever  and while fastball velocity ha risen in recent year  pitcher are also throwing a greater percentage of breaking ball  that is one factor explaining why wild pitch and passed ball are on the rise  <BRK> more important  though  is the emphais on framing   that is  getting borderline pitch called for strike  when a catcher try to present a pitch on the corner a a strike  he will try to keep most of his glove in the strike zone  catching such pitch in the tip of the webbing  and not the pocket  naturally lead to more pitch that clip the edge of the mitt and roll away  <BRK>  it may be the most demanding position in all of sport   moore said   there are more good n f l  quarterback than there are complete major league catcher with the standard we were raised with   <BRK> those standard are changing  a reflected the red sox  who were so satisfied with catcher blake swihart and christian vaquez that they brought them both back despite their weak bat  boston catcher excelled on defense  ranking third in the major at framing  according to baeball prospectus  the two team above them were the national league champion los angeles dodger and  in first place  the arizona diamondback  <BRK> it is no coincidence that one of arizona s catcher last season  jeff mathis  attracted the attention of the team that ranked worst at framing  the texas ranger  mathis hit    and ha a    average across   season  but his exceptional defensive skill earned him a two year       million deal from the ranger  <BRK> that is a modest deal industry standard  but it is the richest one mathis  who turn   this month  ha ever signed  he might have had little market appeal anymore if not for today s method of measuring defense  <BRK>  i ve always taken a lot of pride in the defensive side of my game   mathis said   obviously i d love to contribute a lot more offensively  and i think i can  but for them to acknowledge defense the way they have the last few year is something that i ve definitely benefited from and definitely thankful for   <BRK> jon daniel  the ranger  president of baeball operation  said the team determined at the start of the off seaon to target a defensive oriented catcher  the ranger are entering their final seaon at outdoor globe life park   a hitter s paradise   and plan to integrate young pitcher onto their roster a they move to an indoor ballpark in    <BRK> besides mathis  the ranger considered martin maldonado  who lingered on the market and eventually signed with the royal a perez s replacement  for      million  maldonado had a meager    o p s  for the los angeles angel lat seaon but still appealed to the houston atros  who traded for him in july and started him in six of their eight playoff game  <BRK> the previous october  brian mccann caught every inning for the astros through their victory in game   of the world series  the   year old mccann  who is second on the active list in game caught behind the st  louis cardinal  yadier molina  slumped to a    average last season and signed for one year and    million with his original team  the atlanta brave  <BRK> jeff luhnow  the astros  general manager and a former cardinal executive  spoke wistfully recently about  the day of having a yadi molina   he could not bring himself to say that those day are over  but he doe not see a successor  <BRK>  i m sure there will be some guy like that in the future  but i don t know why we re not developing catcher a much   luhnow said   of all the position in baeball  that s probably the thinnest   <BRK> this may simply be a down cycle  baseball america ranked seven catcher among it top   prospect this season  the most since    then again  that crop from seven year ago   travis d arnaud  yasmani grandal  devin mesoraco  jesus montero  wilin rosario  gary sanchez and swihart   ha not yielded many star  <BRK> neal huntington  the pittsburgh pirate  general manager  said the rise of year round amateur baeball could be burning out catching prospect  the relentless physical demand  he said  do not help developing hitter  if a catching prospect show a promising bat  he added  talent evaluator may want him to change position   bryce harper  the phillies  new    million outfielder  wa a catcher a an amateur   <BRK>  the guy who may be a midrange defender but can swing the bat a little bit  we may be thinking about shifting him out from behind home plate because we want the bat to play   and we ve become so strict on receiving analytics that we re almost unforgiving in some case   huntington said  <BRK>  so we ve shifted the pendulum way to the defensive side because we recognize the value it brings  there s also value in that guy who can receive and hit  but that guy who s an exceptional receiver  he get the benefit of the doubt every single time  and we ve been able to quantify that  so the guy that used to kind of fade away are now hanging around longer   <BRK> mathis wa not the only veteran catcher to receive a multiyear deal in free agency  kurt suzuki     got a two year     million contract in november from the wahington national  who did not stop there  ten day later  they traded for yan gomes  an all star catcher for cleveland last season  <BRK> suzuki   who caught   game for oakland in    his first full season in the major   said he wa happy to share the role  the same analytics wave that identifies and value catcher  defense also make the job more demanding because of the volume of information to process before game  <BRK>  it used to be a dvd   suzuki said   you d watch video and go   this is how we re going to get him out   now you ve got all these heat map  velocity  and you re like   wow  this is a brain cram   it s a lot of studying  a lot of stress and strain on the brain  to have that mental rest is awesome   <BRK> the national  time sharing plan is becoming more of the rule than the exception  the productive hitter who catch nearly every game is harder and harder to find   even  at least for this season  in kansa city  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
