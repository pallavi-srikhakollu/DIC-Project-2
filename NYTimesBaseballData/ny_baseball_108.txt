shot that cut seattle s early     lead to     <BRK> we have so many good player  starting with springer   altuve said   he hit the two run homer to get some momentum  then we kept swinging  kept getting on base  and it seems like even with two out the inning is not over for u and we keep scoring run  <BRK>the combination of starter wade miley  a former mariner pitcher  and brad peacock       helped houston hold down seattle s muscular lineup  which came into the series with it al west rival with   home run and   run scored <BRK>the mariner  who entered the game with a six game winning streak  appeared to be up to the trick that helped them to the major league s best record three week into the season  jumping on miley early  they forced him to throw   pitch in the first inning  taking a     lead on tim beckham s rbi single  domingo santana s two rbi single extended the lead to     in the second <BRK>from there  though  miley tightened thing up through the fourth inning  when he wa pulled for peacock  the right hander began the seaon a a starter  taking two turn through the rotation before being moved to the bullpen during a stretch in which manager aj hinch plan to use four starter due to a fortuitous run of day off <BRK>miley and peacock combined to pitch       inning  giving up seven hit with nine strikeout and two walk  they held the mariner hitless for four

his sixth home run of the season deep to left field  it wa the second grand slam of the second baseman s career <BRK> unfortunately  out of the whole outing  i think that  altuve s grand slam  wa the only bad pitch that i threw  and i threw it to the wrong hitter   armstrong said   he s really good up there  he s really aggressive  and when you leave a ball middle middle like that he s going to make good contact on it in that situation <BRK> one pitch  he made me pay for it  <BRK>trainer s room<BRK>bregman wa able to sprint full speed in workout before the game  hinch said  but remained out
