final three out of the world series at dodger stadium last fall  starter chris sale came in from the bullpen instead  and this season the red sox  despite bringing back almost their entire championship roster  must continue to improvise in relief  they lost joe kelly to the dodger in free agency  have kept kimbrel in limbo  and have signed no replacement <BRK>yankee in tampa  fla   the yankee have no such worry  they brought back zack britton and signed adam ottavino  who will join chad green  dellin betances and aroldis chapman to form an imposing bullpen  the yankee have fully embraced the modern pitching structure  emphaizing quality over quantity from starter  only luis severino worked   inning last season  and the newcomer james paxton   a six year veteran   ha never reached the   inning threshold to qualify for an earned run average title <BRK>mets in port st  lucie  fla   the mets have a similar look  they also signed two veteran reliever   their former closer  jeurys familia  and the left hander justin wilson   and traded for the all star closer edwin diaz  the national league east should be one of baseball s most competitive division  but with jacob degrom  noah syndergaard and zack wheeler at the front of his rotation  the new general manager brodie van wagenen concedes nothing  van wagenen ha also improved the position player depth for the mets  who plan to spread around playing time to finally keep their roster healthy <BRK>miami marlin down the road in jupiter  fla   the marlin changed their uniform but kept the same dominant color  funereal black  the teardown derek jeter  their chief executive  continued with lat week s trade of j t  realmuto  the best catcher in baeball  to philadelphia for prospect and catcher jorge alfaro  who lat seaon became the first player to record more than   strikeout  fewer than   walk and no more than   home run in a seaon  on tuesday  at leat  jeter did add a catcher with a sterling résumé  his old pal  jorge posada  who joined the organization a a special advisor <BRK>st  louis cardinal while realmuto is gone from jupiter  another star arrived  on the cardinal  side of the complex  first baeman paul goldschmidt  acquired in a trade from arizona in december  goldschmidt is the kind of slugger the cardinal have missed since albert pujols left after the   seaon  and also brings a good glove to the team that led the major in error lat seaon  the cardinal also signed reliever andrew miller a they seek to get back to the playoff for the first time since   <BRK>seattle mariner that postseason le stretch is a small fraction of the longest playoff drought in the major  the mariner  who train in peoria  ariz   have not been to the playoff since    when a rookie named ichiro suzuki arrived from japan  suzuki     is back this spring after an awkward shutdown last may  the mariner open this season in japan  where expanded roster will make it easy to accommodate a homecoming for suzuki  who ha piled up     hit since he began with the orix blue wave in    suzuki actually fit the theme of this roster  which ha been loaded with veteran placeholder jerry dipoto  the aggressive general manager who is building for a brighter future that never seems to arrive <BRK>los angeles angel dipoto wa the angel  general manager for their last playoff appearance  in    when they were swept in three game kansa city  that remains the only postseason experience for the incomparable center fielder mike trout  who report to tempe  ariz   with just two season left on his contract  trout  the pride of millville  n j   attended the philadelphia  er  n b a  game against the laker on sunday  and he wan t rooting for the team in purple  the angel hope to convince trout to resist the pull of home and spend his entire career in anaheim  but they have made only modest investment this winter  spending about    million in one year deal for catcher jonathan lucroy  starter trevor cahill and matt harvey  remember him   and closer cody allen <BRK>cleveland indian cleveland shed allen and miller from it bullpen  and also parted with eight different hitter who started in the playoff  yonder alonso  michael brantley  melky cabrera  yandy diaz  josh donaldson  edwin encarnacion  yan gomes and brandon guyer  another  the star shortstop francisco lindor  strained his right calf recently and might not be ready opening day  the indian can still smile when they watch their talented starter train in goodyear  ariz   but the fragile state of the rest of this roster just might give an opening to someone   anyone    in a very weak american league central <BRK>chicago cub like cleveland  the cub have returned to the playoff in both season since the two club faced off in a thrilling world series in    last season  though  chicago collapsed over two dreary day at wrigley field  losing a one game division playoff to milwaukee before dropping the wild card game to colorado  the cub train in mesa  ariz   where manager joe maddon life  the cub have replaced several of maddon s coach recently and did not extend his contract beyond this season   if they start slowly in chicago  might they give him a one way ticket back to mesa <BRK>cincinnati red the n l  central should be a challenge again  because even the worst team is trying  before their current stretch  the red had not finished in lat place across four consecutive seaon since the  s  they re tired of it  and bring a rebuilt rotation to goodyear  ariz   with sonny gray  tanner roark and alex wood joining luis catillo and anthony desclafani  the red also acquired outfielder matt kemp and yaiel puig from the dodger  and hired friendly face to new manager david bell s staff  the pitching coach derek johnson worked with gray at vanderbilt  and the hitting coach turner ward know puig from los angeles  puig liked to kiss ward after homer a a dodger  so perhaps he will show up early to red  camp on thursday   valentine s day <BRK><BRK>
