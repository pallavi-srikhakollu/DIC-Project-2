 <BRK>  <BRK> by the associated press <BRK> new york   the yankee  stunning injury list grew again friday  and thing are only getting worse for a few of the player already on it  <BRK> general manager brian cashman said right handed reliever dellin betances will get a cortisone shot in his right shoulder saturday  which will keep him out another   to   week  that came hour catcher gary sánchez became the  th new york player added to the il with a strained left calf  <BRK> betances opened the season on the il after dealing with inflammation in his shoulder during spring training  cashman said after a rain shortened     loss to the chicago white sox that oral anti inflammatories did not solve the issue  a determination made after betances struggled through a simulated game thursday  <BRK> betances had an mri on friday that showed inflammation centered around a bone spur in the back of his shoulder  cashman said the yankee have been aware of the spur since drafting the   foot   pitcher in    but it hadn t caused him discomfort until this spring  betances is expected to be shut down for three week  then begin rehabbing with hope of returning in late may  <BRK>  the strong belief is that it will resolve   cashman said   but obviously it s a killer for a period of time   <BRK> the bullpen ha struggled without betances  part of why new york is     with four straight loss despite leading in   of   game  chad green ha an     era after allowing two homer friday  jonathan holder ha a     era  and zack britton is at      not that the rotation ha been much help   only masahiro tanaka ha reliably pitched deep into game  <BRK>  we re not getting the competitive play from the healthy guy that we should expect at the same time   cashman said  <BRK> sánchez wa added to the il a day after a precautionary mri revealed his injury  sánchez said through a translator that he wa  surprised  the mri result  believing the tightness he felt in his calf this week wouldn t require him to miss more time  he wa held out of the starting lineup wednesday at houston and struck out a a pinch hitter  he said he felt fine after that game  <BRK> he had the mri during a day off thursday  and the yankee decided the strain wa severe enough to warrant placing him on the   day il  retroactive to thursday  sánchez hope to return when he s eligible  <BRK> manager aaron boone said sánchez didn t want to go on the il  but the team convinced him to take the cautious route early in the season  <BRK>  it s frustrating because you want to play   sánchez said   you want to play all the time   <BRK> cashman also revealed that there is an ongoing mystery surrounding ace luis severino s strained lat  <BRK> severino wa scratched from what would have been his first spring training appearance with right shoulder inflammation  he wa progressing well in his rehab  going through a promising long toss session saturday  before suddenly reporting discomfort playing catch monday  <BRK> test revealed a grade   strain  which will prevent the young ace from throwing for six week  cashman said he is perplexed because such a substantial strain usually happens  where you re maxed out   something that wasn t a part of severino s rehab protocol  <BRK>  i don t know how a lat strain during his rehab process could have occurred   cashman said   it s a new injury  it s a significant one  <BRK>  there is nothing that i can provide for you that would explain how he wound up with a grade   lat strain   he added  <BRK> more than half the yankee starting lineup is hurt  sánchez joined outfielder giancarlo stanton  strained left biceps  and aaron hick  left lower back strain   shortstop didi gregorius  recovering from tommy john surgery last october   third baseman miguel andújar  torn labrum in right shoulder  and shortstop troy tulowitzki  strained left calf  on the il  <BRK> new york will get left hander cc sabathia off the il on saturday  sabathia is set to make his first start since having an angioplasty and right knee surgery during the offseason  <BRK> the   year old sabathia had been rehabbing with class a tampa  he returned to new york on wednesday  and his message to the clubhouse wa simple  <BRK> andújar threw lightly friday and also took swing off a tee  he s attempting to avoid surgery for a small labrum tear in his right shoulder  boone said the biggest concern is the throwing  and it s still too soon to determine if the third baseman can rehab rather than have a season ending operation  <BRK> boone also said stanton and hick are recovering well  although neither is nearing an immediate return  <BRK> new york recalled catcher kyle higashioka from triple a scranton wilkes barre before the series opener against the white sox  <BRK> the yankee injured list also includes pitcher jordan montgomery and ben heller  and oft injured outfielder jacoby ellsbury  who last played in    <BRK> new york is more than halfway to it   total of   player who had disabled list stint  <BRK> the yankee sent left hander stephen tarpley to triple a after friday s game  <BRK> ___ <BRK>  <BRK>
