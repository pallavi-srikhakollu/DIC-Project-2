book excerpt<BRK>pitcher have used all sort of trick to adulterate ball and make their job easier  these day  though  it s harder to create the necessary mess <BRK>gaylord perry pitching for the indian at yankee stadium in    perry is one of several hall of fame pitcher with a reputation for doctoring baseball creditcreditassociated press<BRK><BRK>by tyler kepner<BRK>the brooklyn dodger met an old friend on a trip to st  louis early in the   season  preacher roe  a sly and slender lefty who had just retired to west plain  mo   entertained his former teammate at the chase hotel  he needed their advice <BRK> we sat around a big table  all talking to preacher   recall carl erskine  a top dodger starter then   he said   fella  i want to ask you a question  sport illustrated ha offered me      to tell them how i threw the spitter  you think i should do that or not  with that      i can blacktop my driveway and i can fix up my house  i could really use that       what do you think  <BRK> the guy all said   yeah  go ahead  preach  sure  why not   i did not  i admired preacher  he wa a great study to watch pitch  he wa very clever and won a lot of game  he wa really a pitcher s pitcher  so i didn t say yes to that  a we were leaving the dining room  preacher said   i didn t hear you speak up   i said   no  i didn t  preacher  you were such an outstanding pitcher without the spitter  i d hate to see you taint your whole career talking about throwing it  <BRK> so anyway  preacher did the article  he got the       and sometime later when i talked to preach he said   carl  you know what  i just ruined my chance for the hall of fame admitting i threw the spitter  and you re the only one that advised me not to do it   and i said   well  preacher  i saw you pitch  you were a pitcher s pitcher  you could have won without the spitter   <BRK>maybe  maybe not  while erskine believed in roe  the man himself didn t  in his confession  roe said he turned to the pitch after slumping to     with the pirate in    reviving the spitter  which he had practiced with harry brecheen a a cardinal farmhand  wa his lat chance  he made the most of it  becoming a regular all star  though not quite a cooperstown candidate  for the dodger  cheating only made sense <BRK> why shouldn t i have   roe told dick young in the sport illustrated article   i wa about through when i decided to get me the pitch   if i get caught   i told myself   they ll kick me out  if i don t  i m through anyway  so how can i lose   <BRK>he didn t lose very often  roe won so much   he had a    winning percentage over seven season with brooklyn   that he guessed the spitter had earned him       on the bench between inning  roe would pop a stick of beech nut gum into his mouth and announce   i m going to get me a new batch of curveballs   in the game  he d spit on the meaty part of his thumb while pretending to wipe his brow  then  while hitching his belt  he d subtly wipe his index and middle finger on the saliva  two wet finger on top  a dry thumb underneath  and roe wa ready  he compared it to squeezing a peach pit or a watermelon seed with your fingertip <BRK> the idea is to get part of your grip wet  and the other dry   he said   when the ball leaf your hand  it slip off your wet finger and cling  just tiny like  to the dry part of your thumb  the ball jump on account of it  if it s a good  un  it drop like a dead duck just when it cross the plate  <BRK>roe s confession only confirmed his reputation  a stan musial wrote decade later   i d always be first pitch hitting against roe  because when he had two strike on you  he d usually load up  and i hated to get a shower   anticipation of the spitter helped roe  and he knew how to destroy evidence  he wa never caught in the act <BRK> the umpire would call for the ball  and preacher would stomp around and look at his hand like   uh oh  you probably got me this time    erskine say   and then instead of tossing the ball in  he d roll it to the umpire on the ground  <BRK>like steroid user decade later  roe stayed ahead of the cop and thrived  but his pang of regret to erskine   at least for going public and bursting his cloud of mystery   showed that he knew what he had done  the specter of the dark art would indeed follow roe to his grave  when he died in    the word  spitball  appeared in the headline of his new york time obituary <BRK>after two chaotic decade or so  the spitball wa banned for    the same year the country went dry under prohibition  the rule simply turned the mound into a speakeay  with many pitcher going undercover to get the same slippery edge a their predecessor <BRK>the physic behind the spitball is simple enough  when the ball slide off wet finger  it loses backspin and therefore rotates le   something like a knuckleball  which should not rotate at all  or a forkball tumbling in it final plunge <BRK>defacing the surface of a ball produce the same kind of effect   added movement  to the opposite side of the scuff  this also date to the game s early day  imagine what the baseball looked like in the early  th century <BRK> we d play a whole game with one ball  if it stayed in the park   wahoo sam crawford  a hall of famer who played from   to    say in  the glory of their time   a book lawrence s  ritter <BRK> lopsided  and black  and full of tobacco and licorice stain   crawford continues   the pitcher used to have it all their way back then  <BRK>even the possibility of scuffing give pitcher an edge  these word come from chet brewer  a star for the kansa city monarch of the negro national league in the late  s  and they sound timeless <BRK> a cut ball  i got credit for that   he told john holway in the book  black diamond    if i picked up a rough one  i didn t throw it out of the game  i didn t exactly put the cut on it myself  but i could pitch it  <BRK>scuffing charge never dogged mike mussina  a hall of fame right hander for the oriole and the yankee from   to    but like any smart pitcher  he would never reject a ball that came to him with a mark  this wa mussina s order for every catcher  if a ball scrape the ground  never volunteer it to the umpire <BRK> say a guy hit a ground ball to short and they throw it back to me from first bae   a soon a i grab the ball  i m running my thumb over these   mussina say  he is holding a ball and referring to the white area within the horseshoe   do i have a sinker out of this ball  and if i find one i think s pretty good  i flip it to the other side to see if it s scuffed up on the wrong side  <BRK>by that he mean the opposite side  if both horseshoe area are scuffed  they ll counteract each other  to no advantage  if there s a scuff where the seam narrow   the sweet spot   it creates a four seam sinker  a pitch that spin like a straight fastball but veers away  in the direction opposite the scuff <BRK>a common lament among retired pitcher is that too many ball are now thrown out of play  to them  it underscore a lack of craftsmanship on the mound <BRK> i ve literally seen teammate  when there s a scuff on the ball they get rid of it   say jamie moyer  who won   game in a career that ended in    the year he turned     they ll say   oh  it doe funny stuff   and you go   wait a minute  that funny stuff can be a benefit to you   <BRK>hitter are conditioned now to ask umpire to discard any ball that skip  umpire and catcher know this  so catcher tend to have an almost reflexive response  they will spear a ball from the dirt  transfer it quickly to their throwing hand  and hold it up for the ump to keep or reject <BRK>of course  some fielder still try to create a scuff  catcher may deliberately short hop their throw before inning  and outfielder may do the same on routine throw to the infield  but time have changed <BRK> when i played  a ball hit the dirt  it wa still in play   say chili davis  the mets hitting coach  who played from   to     today s game  if a catcher throw a ball down to second on a short hop  or a ball get blocked in the dirt  that ball s out of the game  it s just automatic now  <BRK>pitcher also seek way to look natural while applying moisture or tackiness to their finger  one former player  now a broadcaster  reached into his team s ball bag for me and pulled out a canister of colorless tuf skin  a spray that help secure athletic tape  with one spritz of tuf skin on my arm  i had an invisible island of instant tackiness for my finger <BRK>that s also why pitcher like putting clear bullfrog sunscreen on their arm  grab the rosin bag  aimlessly touch the bullfrog spot  and you ll have just enough stickiness to help guide your pitch  one catcher say he ha seen pitcher leave the dugout between inning and wrap their finger around a ball coated with pine tar  leaving just enough residue on their hand to get a better grip when they return to the mound <BRK>next time you go to a game  notice all the surface a pitcher touch with his hand  pitcher are fidgety creature  constantly tugging and swiping and scratching their cap  their sleeve  their skin  something  corey kluber  the two time cy young award winner for cleveland  grab his tongue on the mound before every pitch   which became legal again year ago   then wipe his hand on the side of his pant <BRK> the way they rub the ball up now  they rub them up all in advance   kluber say   they re not rubbed up all day  and they sit in the bucket with all the dust and stuff  and they get so slippery  just get a little bit of moisture on your hand  at leat  you ve still got to wipe it off  obviously  but you get a little bit of moisture on your hand so the ball s not a dry  <BRK>kluber doe this no matter the weather  but such tactic are especially handy in the cold and at high altitude  where it s harder to generate moisture <BRK> i tell you what   say one   year veteran   if they could get a camera behind the dugout in colorado  it would be like a mad scientist s laboratory down there  people doing anything they can to find a grip  <BRK>most player  even hitter  tend to accept this practice  a pitch can be an instrument of destruction  after all  and a hitter would rather the pitcher know where it s going than accidentally fire a cue ball at his head  it is a fine distinction  to be sure  but this is the logic  tackiness help command and finish on a pitch  and that s o k  sandpaper or k y jelly help enhance movement  and that s not <BRK> in the cold weather in minnesota  you had to have something to grip the curveball   say jim kaat  who starred for the twin in the  s   pitcher for year have lobbied  if hitter can use pine tar to grip the bat better   it doesn t help  em hit it any farther   we should be able to use pine tar  <BRK>then again  it come back to discretion  in    when the yankee  michael pineda brazenly smeared pine tar on his neck on a chilly night at fenway park  it wa so overt that the red sox felt compelled to object  pineda got a   game suspension and widespread ridicule  but generally  a long a a pitcher is discreet  the other side ha no problem with pine tar <BRK>pine tar is one thing   cheating the letter of the law  yes  but not the spirit  whatever happened to the spitball  the hall of fame pitch of jack chesbro and ed walsh  stan coveleski and red faber  burleigh grime and gaylord perry  richie ahburn  who had the most hit of the  s  always thought of pitcher a shifty character  never to be trusted <BRK>where have all the scoundrel gone <BRK>when i aked perry in   why more pitcher were not a  shall we say  crafty a they were in his day  he had a short but telling answer   well  maybe they don t need it   dan plesac  who pitched in more than     game  agreed <BRK> you re not looking for a don sutton now  a guy that can sink it and cut it and make the ball move   plesac say   if you don t have velocity  you can t pitch anymore  how many guy  how many real power pitcher  need to scuff the ball to be successful  not many  you don t need to  if your stuff is that good  <BRK>plesac work for mlb network  founded in    the hub of baseball s vast and ever expanding visual empire  every fan can watch game on the at bat app  every team ha a bank of video screen  usually just off the dugout  showing every conceivable angle for replay and analysis  good luck evading the most sophisticated alarm system in baseball history <BRK> when there s so many tv camera  it s so hard to get away with it   say jason giambi  who played   season in the major   you have so many set of eye on these guy  and especially if they see a pitch that look really abnormal  the  team video analyst  rewinds it     time   o k   what did he do different  oh  he went to the side of his pant  he went to his belt  he went to the top of his hat   then they start to put together the timeline of every time he s pitched  doe that ball do the same thing  what about his last start  his start before that  and before you know it  they ve got it down   all right  go tell the umpire to check his hat  or check the side of his pant  or check inside his glove  you can t hide anymore  <BRK>but what if you could  what if the next preacher roe or gaylord perry wa hiding in plain sight on a diamond near you  fiendishly fooling all the viewer and video technician at the ballpark and beyond <BRK>he could blacktop a lot of driveway selling those secret   and he d probably keep the supply after finishing the job  the sticky sealant just might come in handy <BRK>the article is an excerpt from  k  a history of baseball in ten pitch   tyler kepner  a new york time sportswriter  the book will be released on april   <BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK>
