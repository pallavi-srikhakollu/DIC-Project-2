<BRK><BRK>sport of the time<BRK>by michael powell<BRK>just for kick i listened a brodie van wagenen  the mets  general manager  went on about signing the oft injured   year old second baeman jed lowrie and reporter sounded entranced his jive <BRK>have you  they asked  thought of bidding on outfielder bryce harper or infielder manny machado  the two young star free agent who improbably have attracted not much attention this winter <BRK>van wagenen  a smooth talking agent who ha become a smooth talking general manager  smiled genially   let s be candid here   he said   the outfield is probably not our top priority at this point   jeff mcneil  a career minor leaguer until last july  wa going out to the outfield  van wagenen said  and  he give u another really good weapon  <BRK>that the mets  a little market club hard flushing bay  will play it cheap is a well established fact  but van wagenen speaks the management palaver of choice this parsimonious winter  no one want to spend money <BRK>the cub  the yankee  the dodger  the giant  the cardinal  the brave  the ranger and the angel   all have apparently passed on making a bid for harper and machado  each franchise is owned a wealthy man  or family  in a wealth laden sport and all could presumably find a place in the lineup for one of these young star  and yet for the second season in a row  at a time of the off season when the best free agent typically would have already signed handsome new contract  most owner have tucked away their wallet and claimed to need no more talent <BRK>candidly  van wagenen s reasoning for the mets  disinterest is good for a giggle  mcneil is a late blooming minor league second baseman who in a few nice month in the major hit three home run and knocked in   run  he s a career infielder without a career to speak of <BRK>harper  way of no comparison  last season hit   home run  walked   time  scored   run and knocked in    he is a former rookie of the year and league m v p   and he s all of    to suggest you will pas on harper in hope that mcneil find his outfield leg is   with no offense intended to the mcneil family   whacked <BRK>machado and harper are not the only quality free agent left flapping in the wind  dallas keuchel  a good starting pitcher  and mike moustakas  a fine third baseman who hit   homer last year  have elicited little interest  craig kimbrel  that world champion red sox closer with   save  give him a call  he d probably like to chat  yasmani grandal  the best catcher on the market  wa expected to command a multiyear contract  he could scrounge up no better than a one year     million deal with the milwaukee brewer <BRK>the major league baseball player association project at least   of baseball s   team will start   with a  substantially lower payroll  than    only four or five are expected to show a significant increase   player are well past  concerned    bruce meyer  the union s director of collective bargaining  told me   at a time when industry revenue and club valuation are growing for the second straight off season  an alarming number of club are declining to compete for the many talented player  <BRK>major league baseball official claim to see no problem  the deputy commissioner  dan halem  helped negotiate the last collective bargaining agreement with the player union  and he say labor s portion of nearly    billion in baseball revenue ha held steady  his estimate includes player in baseball s vast minor league system  though  none of whom are in the union and some fair number of whom   thanks to baseball s lobbying with congress   make le than the minimum wage <BRK>baseball drove down a road that looked suspiciously like this one between   and   and that ended in a multicar collision with three separate finding that it owner had engaged in illegal collusion to hold down player salary  the owner paid penalty of    million plus interest to the player  and in the  s the sport weathered brutal strike that owed to the residual bitterness <BRK>the former baseball commissioner fay vincent  appointed the owner and no marxist  wa moved at that time to remark to the owner   the single biggest reality you guy have to face up to is collusion  you stole    million from the player  and the player are unified to a man around that issue  because you got caught and many of you are still involved  <BRK>i posse no proof the current generation of extremely rich owner have acted a stupidly a their predecessor  for now the flaccid free agent market is simply   odd <BRK>the management of this column readily acknowledges the best of the marooned free agent will not be left to scratch nickel together  harper seek a contract north of    million for   year  and machado entered free agency entranced similar sugarplum vision  it is all but assured that one day their descendant will decant a fine bordeaux and offer a heartfelt thanksgiving toast to dear old grandpa bryce and manny <BRK>and so what  megawatt talent in many profession profit handsomely  a point lost on a writer from bleacher report who loosened an ancient grouse  these free agent are paid  silly  money to  play a child s game  <BRK>yes  and playing pretend a a child can lead to movie stardom and an adolescent s toe shoed spin can lead to the city ballet   provided you have great talent and a work ethic to match <BRK>i digress <BRK>baseball official jutify the new parsimony with a bow to analytics  we will not sign this or that star becaue we or some other team once paid out a bad contract  this player became too old  this one too slow  that one too bald  and the thought of a bad contract give u a stomachache <BRK> general manager are extremely analytical  and they tend a a group to make the most efficient decision possible   m l b  s halem told me <BRK>six year ago  the angel gave albert pujols a   year     million contract and that indeed edged to frontier of nuttiness  he wa   when he signed it and already past his prime  his once fabulous eye for ball and strike slowly deserted him  and a man who once led the league in hitting ha not surmounted    the past two season  with year to go  pujols s contract is a mothball special <BRK>harper and machado are not pujols  each man is entering his golden prime and with a reasonable expectation they will produce at a high level for many season to come <BRK>the owner have perhaps snookered a baseball union grown a touch complacent  they regularly manipulate the service time of young player  which work this way  team control player for six season before they become eligible for free agency  so club put thumb to scale and wait to bring up even their very best player until late may or early june  this push back the rookie s service time and save the club many million of dollar <BRK>the difference when a player reach free agency is grand  in    harper led the league with   homer and a    on base percentage and wa voted the national league s most valuable player  he earned      million  next year  he is likely to pull down close to    million <BRK>the union ha tended to tolerate service manipulation  figuring it member would recoup any lost money in free agency  unlike football and basketball  baseball ha no salary cap  it also ha no floor  though  and now owner are squeezing player on either end like so many papaya in a juicer <BRK>baseball owner and the abacus boy would do well not to grow self satisfied  attendance took a decided drop last year  and the lack of a competitive market ha set player in pro sport  most powerful union to grumbling  christian yelich  this year s national league m v p   stopped the new york time last week and said player are talking about the strange sloth in the free agent market <BRK> they re two of the best player that we have in the game   he said   the process hasn t played out  <BRK>last winter  amid another slow free agent market  dodger closer kenley jansen tossed a high fastball at the chin of owner   maybe we have to go on strike  to be honest with you   he said then <BRK>perhaps a knockdown pitch is the best way to wake up a team of complacent billionaire <BRK>an earlier version of this article misstated the number of team in major league baseball  there are    not   <BRK>email  powellm nytimes com<BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK>
