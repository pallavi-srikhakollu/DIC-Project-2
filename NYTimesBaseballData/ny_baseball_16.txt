 <BRK>  <BRK> baseball s hall of fame shouldn t continue to overlook someone whose influence on the game ha been profound  <BRK> by jamie malanowski <BRK> mr  malanowski  a former little league player with a    batting average over   game  is a speechwriter  <BRK> this week  the baseball hall of fame will announce a new class of inductee  setting off round of celebration   and debate  fan will argue over whether mariano rivera deserves unanimous approval  or whether the use of performance enhancing drug should permanently block the enshrinement of barry bond  <BRK> oddly  amid these debate  one of the hall of fame s key omission is likely to be overlooked  how is it that it ha left out   and perhaps not even discussed   the man who ha had the greatest influence on baseball in the last   year  who ha changed how the game is understood  how it is enjoyed and even how it is played  i m talking about the statistician and historian bill james  <BRK> a graduate of the university of kansa  james began his professional involvement with baeball in the late   s  while working night a a security guard at a cannery  when not foiling pork and bean burglary  he used his free time to record and analyze baeball statistic  he had a quirky curiosity that led him to ak offbeat question  whose answer he extracted from the number he kept  he wan t afraid to deflate reputation or debunk conventional wisdom  he turned his finding into article  and eventually best selling book  his writing wa smart  funny  contentious  and unlike anything fan had ever read  <BRK> it may be hard for younger fan to grasp how innumerate baseball wa  there were homer and r b i s and batting average for hitter  win and loss and e r a s for pitcher  team had winning and losing streak  instead of analyst  broadcast had color commentator  <BRK> a a result  fan had little understanding of the game s subtlety  suddenly  here wa james  unearthing hidden explanation  revealing lame asumptions  uncovering the value of overlooked variable  how much did it cost the cub to play day game in wrigley field  did ted williams lose more homer playing in fenway park than joe dimaggio lost playing in yankee stadium   <BRK> james did his best work re evaluating reputation  he showed that the infielder famous for diving catch actually lacked range  that the genius manager who strategically bunted wa actually squandering out  that more of your favorite slugger s homer could be ascribed to close fence than to his prodigious power  <BRK> james revealed a game in which your eye deceived you  a banjo hitting second baseman who walked a lot wa a bigger offensive asset than the long ball threat who struck out a lot  the wily catcher who knew how to frame pitch might be more responsible for strikeout than the pitcher who threw them  <BRK> james did not invent analytics   other student of the game formed the society for american baseball research year before he began his study  but his lively  provocative writing helped him elevate the field at just the right time  the new network espn integrated stats into it programming  player of the new pastime  fantasy baseball  hungered for stats  agent and general manager alike gobbled up stats to justify free agent contract  number enriched the whole show  <BRK> i met james once  at a corporate event in the early   s  we were part of a group that attended an ordinary game at shea stadium between a poor new york mets team and the first place los angeles dodger  james wa a typical fan  he drank a beer  he did the wave  but he also carried a bedraggled notebook  in which he recorded the lineup and the game condition  drew stick figure showing the pitcher  windup  and noted every pitch that wa thrown  <BRK> we were in the middle of a scoreless game when james did something astounding  the dodger pitcher had just recorded out no    for the inning  and james said   the mets are going to score this inning   yeah  right  i thought  one out  nobody on  average hitter coming up  but then  yes  the mets scored  and again  and again  <BRK>   the dodger  starter took   pitch to retire the first hitter   james explained   pitcher usually need   pitch to get through a whole inning   with the pitcher faltering  he said   the mets  chance dramatically increased   <BRK> this year  watch any game  and you will almost certainly hear the announcer discus spin ratio  exit velocity  win above replacement and other analytical concept  team will shift defender  arrange lineup  substitute player and choose pitch all based on the number  you may even gripe about the preponderance of strikeout and homer   another stat derived trend  james did not uncover all these finding  but his analytics revolution pervades baseball   and all major sport are now influenced analytics  did you know goalie who start on back to back night record save percentage on average   point lower on the second night  n h l  general manager do  <BRK> fundamentally  baseball is the same game it ha always been   hit  throw  catch  but thanks to bill james  there have been change  for one thing  james is now an executive with the boston red sox  but more important  a new era of fan know that inside good old country hardball there s a deeper  richer game  cooperstown  the next move is yours  <BRK> jamie malanowski is a speechwriter for gov  andrew
