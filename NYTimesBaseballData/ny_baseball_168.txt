He allowed two runs on four hits, including a home run, and two walks while striking out six."I feel good," Kershaw said postgame. "It was a good first step. Got through everything I needed to, got up to that fifth inning, got some guys on base, worked out of the stretch, did multiple different things. So it was a good day."Helped by a solo home run from Tyrone Taylor off Kershaw, the visiting San Antonio Missions spoiled Oklahoma City's season opener by emerging with a 5-3 win.It is unclear if Kershaw's next start will be in the minors or if he will return to the Dodgers' major league rotation.--Field Level MediaAdvertisement
