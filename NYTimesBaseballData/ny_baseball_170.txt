<BRK><BRK>by victor mather<BRK>the   mets are regularly prefixed with the alliterative nickname miracle <BRK>but that doesn t mean their unlikely world series championship wa the only astonishing run in sporting history  plenty of other team and athlete have defied the odds and the prognosticator to roar to unlikely triumph <BRK>in paying tribute to them  we ll pas over the underdog who were most known for beating the unbeatable  rulon gardner stunning alexander karelin  the united state olympic hockey team topping the soviet  buster douglas knocking out mike tyson  the aptly named upset dealing man o  war his only loss <BRK>instead  we ll look at the team and athlete who came out of nowhere  the longest of the long shot  the miracle <BRK>before the miracle mets of shea stadium  there were the miracle brave of fenway park in boston  and their story were uncannily similar <BRK>two year before  like the mets  the boston brave were awful  going      again  like the mets  they improved some the next year  to      and in their shocking championship year they were     for an unexpected    winning percentage  the mets were     finally  like the mets  they won the world series <BRK>in one way  their miracle outdid the mets  by july    the mets had established themselves at leat a a decent team  they were      eight game out in the national league eat <BRK>not the brave  by july       they were      eighth out of eight in the national league  somehow  they went     the rest of the way  a mind boggling    clip  and won the league  Â½ game  then they swept the philadelphia athletics in the world series <BRK>in the pre ruthian era  the brave were led nine homer from joe connolly  and the good eye of   year old johnny evers  of tinker to evers to chance fame  in his first year away from the cub <BRK>the new york time said  the  makeshift team  compactly welded together with a unity of purpose and a perfect harmony of action  had triumphed over one of the greatest ball club the game ha known  <BRK>before the men s     meter at the   olympics  the world record holder ron clarke of australia and the defending champion pyotr bolotnikov of the soviet union were attracting attention  not attracting attention wa billy mill of the united state  in the day before the race  no reporter asked him a single question  according to the olympic historian david wallechinsky <BRK>but with a lap to go  mill wa right there  the leader had to wind their way through a mas of lapped runner  clarke  finding himself boxed in  shoved mill out of the way  then the tunisian mohamed gammoudi pushed through a well  mill looked to be running for a bronze  the announcer bud palmer speculated about an american record  no one wa thinking gold <BRK>but then mill came tearing up on the outside  he passed clarke  he closed on gammoudi   look at mill  look at mill   hollered the color man  dick bank   bank later said he wa fired nbc for that outburst  which they considered unprofessional  <BRK>mill won in   minute     second  he had never run under   minute before  an official of the tokyo game approached him after the win to ask   who are you  <BRK>the time wrote   mill  who is part sioux indian and   percent american marine  won a race that no one except himself and mr  mill  who wa in the stand  thought he had a chance to win  <BRK>many cite boris becker  who won wimbledon a an unseeded   year old in    a the most unlikely grand slam champion  but not everyone wa taken surprise his win  after becker defeated hank pfister in a first round match  pfister said   there are   other guy in the draw i d rather play  he s got to be among the top four or five in the world right now  <BRK>for a tennis long shot  consider jelena ostapenko  the   french open champion  her previous best grand slam performance  in seven attempt  wa the third round  she wa ranked  th coming into the tournament  but she benefited from some lucky break in the draw  not meeting a seeded player better than no    until the final  where she upended third seeded simona halep to win the title <BRK>even more extreme wa mark edmondson  who won the   australian open a the  th best player in the world  with the caveat that in that era many non australian skipped the event  edmondson did beat the player seeded no     no    and no    on his way to the semifinal  then topped no    ken rosewall and no    john newcombe to win it all <BRK>edmondson had played in two previous grand slam  making the first and second round  just a few week before the tournament he wa mopping floor at a hospital to make end meet <BRK> no way will something like that happen again   bud collins  the journalist and tv commentator  said in   <BRK>the time said  associated press article on edmondson    one of the greatest upset in tennis history  <BRK>villanova in   wa the lowest seeded team to win the n c a a  men s basketball tournament  from it no    spot  it knocked off top seeded michigan and second seeded north carolina on the way to the final four  then beat another no    seeded team  memphis state <BRK>the final  against no    georgetown  wa the last n c a a  tournament game played without a shot clock  villanova took advantage  choosing it shot with care  in the end  it shot a remarkable   for   and a mind boggling   for   in the second half <BRK>it wa a good decade for n c a a  underdog  clemson in   and miami in   each started the football seaon unranked and ended it a national champion <BRK>the time said   in what will surely be remembered a one of the most improbable outcome in the history of the national collegiate athletic asociation tournament  the wildcat  who failed to finish in the nation s top   in any poll this seaon  completed their emotion filled postseaon playing the elusive  perfect game  at the perfect time  <BRK>john daly wa a big hitter  but seemed to offer little else a a golfer  he wan t even going to play in the p g a  championship in    but sneaked into the field a the ninth alternate when others dropped out  a a result of the late entry  he drove all night from memphis to carmel  ind   and teed off without a practice round <BRK>he then barreled his way around the course for a three stroke victory  launching him to a popularity that he maintains today  more than   year later <BRK> i think everybody think of this a a cinderella story   he said   i think the fan won this tournament for me  i really do  <BRK>the time said   playing with a fearless ease that bespoke destiny  a   year old rookie golfer named john daly completed an underdog story of rocky like proportion today  <BRK>where else to find long shot but at the racetrack  the biggest longest shot to win the kentucky derby wa donerail in   at odds of      but that is topped the breeder  cup classic winner of   <BRK>arcangues had raced around britain and france without winning anything major  and all his race had been on grass  the classic is on dirt  and regularly feature the very best dirt horse in the world  so it wa no surprise that arcangues went off at odds         that made donerail look like a comparative sure thing <BRK>but arcangues ran down the speedy bertrando  winner of several important dirt race in the united state  and won  prompting race caller tom durkin to say   here is arcangues to win it  in an absolute shocker  <BRK>the time said   arcangues s winning payoff of      for    wa the biggest in the   year history of the breeder  cup  his price wa so high that his actual odds did not even fit into the infield tote board  which only go a high a      <BRK>the st  louis ram won seven game in    then six game the following season  then five  then four  going into the   season the trend line did not look good <BRK>when quarterback trent green tore up his knee in the preseason  the ram turned to someone named kurt warner  who wa undrafted out of northern iowa and whose main professional experience wa with the iowa barnstormer of the arena football league and the amsterdam admiral of n f l  europe <BRK>so no surprise that the bookmaker had the ram at     to win it all <BRK>warner proceeded to lead the team to a     regular season record  which earned him the league s most valuable player award  the ram then beat the tennessee titan in the super bowl  and warner won another m v p  award <BRK>the time said  in a week   preview    kurt warner make his first n f l  start  it won t be a memorable one    warner beat the raven with   passing yard and   touchdown  <BRK>all these story are amazing  but this one is just a little more amazing than the others  the modern english premier league is essentially a closed shop  the big team not only take first place every year  they take second  third and fourth a well <BRK>so no one blinked when leicester   th the previous year  wa listed at     to   to lift the league trophy  heck  why not a million to one  for a team that wa hoping to avoid relegation  winning the title seemed impossible <BRK>but behind the smart midfield leadership of n golo kante and riyad mahrez and the goal of jamie vardy  who had been discovered playing in england s fifth division  leicester won some game  and then some more  much credit wa given to the unconventional management style of claudio ranieri  and his nonsensical catch phrase   dilly ding  dilly dong  <BRK>leicester ended up not just winning the premier league  but winning it an improbable   point margin  leaving arsenal  tottenham and the manchester team far behind <BRK>the time said   soccer crazed  working class leicester is verging on one of those ridiculous season  an unimaginable championship that wa given worse betting odds at the start than finding elvis alive  <BRK>miraculous <BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK>
