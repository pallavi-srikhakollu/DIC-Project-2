 <BRK>  <BRK> by tyler kepner <BRK> mariano rivera  the career save leader whose elegant efficiency helped the yankee win five world series  on tuesday became the first player ever elected unanimously to the baseball hall of fame  <BRK> two other right handed pitcher  roy halladay and mike mussina  also were elected  halladay on his first try and mussina on his sixth  edgar martinez  the longtime seattle mariner designated hitter  gained entry in his  th and final year on the ballot  halladay  a former ace of the toronto blue jay and the philadelphia phillies  died in a plane crash in    <BRK> rivera wa named on all   of the ballot cast member of the baseball writer  association of america  eclipsing the previous record percentage       ken griffey jr  in    halladay and martinez both received     percent of the vote  and mussina   a stalwart for the baltimore oriole and the yankee       percent  candidate need   percent for election  <BRK>  after my career  i wa thinking that i had a shot to be a hall of famer   rivera said on a conference call with reporter   but this wa just beyond my imagination  i wa amazed the way all this ha been  through my whole career   and this being the pinnacle of every player that play the game of baseball  to be unanimous   <BRK> the player will be inducted to the hall of fame on july   in cooperstown  n y   along with designated hitter harold baines and reliever lee smith  who were passed over the writer but were elected a smaller committee last month  <BRK> barry bond and roger clemens  whose dominant career stretched from the mid  s through    were again denied entry in what wa the seventh appearance on the ballot for both player  both have strong tie to performance enhancing drug  which baseball did not test for until    bond got     percent of the vote  and clemens     percent   their highest total yet  but still shy of   percent  <BRK> rivera     signed with the yankee from panama in   for a      bonus  he reached the major five year later and started   game  the lat batter he faced a a starter wa martinez  who singled home a run in the fifth inning against him on sept        knocking rivera from the game and sending him to the bullpen forever  <BRK> it wa a perfect fit  rivera thrived a a setup man in the yankee    championship run and took over a the team s closer in    the year he discovered his devatating cut fatball  which broke hundred of bat with it hard  late movement into the hand of left handers  rivera remained the closer through his retirement in    compiling   save with a     earned run average  the lowest in baeball history for anyone born after    and with a minimum of     major league inning   <BRK> rivera wa even better across his record   postseason game  with a     e r a  and   save   matching his uniform number  he wa the last player to regularly wear no     which is retired across major league baseball for jackie robinson  <BRK> rivera wa so prolific that m l b  named an award after him to recognize the american league reliever of the year  likewise  martinez is the namesake for the award recognizing the best designated hitter  martinez     made only   career start in the field  mostly at third bae  but nearly     a the mariner  d h  <BRK> martinez won a l  batting title in   and    when he helped lead the mariner to their first playoff berth  securing the team s future in seattle  for his career  he hit    with a    on base percentage and a    slugging percentage  only two other right handed hitter in the game s history   jimmie foxx and rogers hornsby   were better in all three category with at least     plate appearance  <BRK> even so  it took a while for martinez s cae to build momentum  the writer had never elected a player with a many game a martinez a a d h   a position created in   to boost offense in the american league  in    only     percent of the writer voted for martinez  <BRK> but that support ha grown steadily  and martinez became the fifth player elected in his final year of eligibility the writer  joining red ruffing      ralph kiner      jim rice     and tim raines      martinez made it just in time   but  he said  the time wa right  <BRK>  the fact that i m going in with mariano  that mean a lot  especially because not only wa he the top reliever in the game  but also he s a great human being  a great person   said martinez  who went   for   in his career against rivera   it s also the fact that he got   percent of the vote   that make it also extra special   <BRK> mussina     earned   victory and finished with a flourish  securing his first   win season on the final day of his career in    his strikeout to walk rate       to     is the best in history among pitcher with at least   start  and he did it all in the a l  east  taming it brawny hitter in small ballpark with a wide array of pitch and a knack for improvisation  <BRK>  i just kept trying to make adjustment   said mussina  whose curveball wa perhaps the best of his generation   you keep trying to do thing a you get older and certain skill start going away  you have to find other way to do your job and be good at it  that s really all i wa ever trying to do   to be one of the five starter every year   <BRK> halladay reached the major in   but tumbled to clas a in   to rebuild his mechanic and confidence  he re emerged a baeball s pre eminent starter from   through    averaging   victory a seaon and winning the cy young award in both league  <BRK> he led his league in complete game nine time and finished with    a figure unlikely to be matched anytime soon  no active pitcher ha more than   complete game  and no staff last season collected more than five  halladay  who threw a perfect game and a playoff no hitter for the phillies in    now seems like a relic in a craft that relies more and more on relief pitcher  <BRK>  it s funny  nobody s getting to   inning anymore  and to me   wa like the minimum   halladay said in march     you watch the minor league and young player now  there s such an emphasis on swing and miss and strikeout  so there s more pitch  there s deeper count  i felt like my best game were when i threw under   pitch and threw a complete game  to me  that wa a better game  <BRK>  sometimes i d go out and throw seven or eight inning and be at   pitch  but if i wa efficient i wanted to throw nine in under   pitch  but that wa   challenge  em  pitch to contact   where now there s so much put on   with two strike  you can t let him hit it   for me  i felt like with two strike              if they didn t swing at it  it wa going to be strike three   <BRK> halladay  the son of a pilot  took up aviation after back and shoulder problem forced his retirement in    he wa only   when he crashed his small plane into shallow water near holiday  fla   on nov        he is the first player elected posthumously the writer since roberto clemente  the pittsburgh pirate outfielder who died in a plane crash in    <BRK>  if only roy were here to personally express his gratitude for this honor   said brandy halladay  his widow  in a statement   what an even more amazing day this would be   <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
