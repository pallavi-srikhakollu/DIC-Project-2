<BRK><BRK>on baseball<BRK>by tyler kepner<BRK>clearwater  fla    bryce harper will soon be the most scrutinized athlete in philadelphia  or the most hated  neither role sound fun  if he sign a record contract with the phillies  harper will be both hailed a a savior and held to nearly impossible standard  if he sign somewhere else  he will be a pariah <BRK>maybe harper simply want no part of the phillies  or maybe he is just waiting for their owner  john middleton  to blow pat the   year     million agreement manny machado reached this week with the san diego padre  a harper and his agent  scott bora  take their time  the phillies are not dangling a blank check <BRK> the most important thing for any organization is to have continuity and a consensus from ownership through management   phillies general manager matt klentak said on wednesday in his office at spectrum field after a long day of meeting   we know what we re willing to do  and we know what we re not willing to do  and everybody s on board  <BRK>the phillies loved machado  perhaps even more than they do harper  they tried to trade for machado last summer  they met with him in person this winter  and they offered him a lucrative deal   but would not go to    million  the phillies might do so for harper  but insist they will not act out of desperation <BRK>middleton did give that impression in november  when he told bob nightengale of usa today that the team wa  expecting to spend money  and maybe even be a little stupid about it   the phillies have spent money  but they have not been stupid <BRK>after stumbling down the stretch to an     finish last season  the phillies have added four high impact player  all with all star pedigree  left fielder andrew mccutchen  catcher j t  realmuto  reliever david robertson and shortstop jean segura  they signed their ace  aaron nola  to a four year     million contract extension  and added other reliever in trade <BRK>the move improved a dreadful defense and a lineup that produced the fewest hit in the major lat seaon  they were prudent  responsible move  but middleton s statement wa widely viewed a a promise of something bolder  setting up a binary view of the phillies  winter  success  machado or harper  or failure  anything else  <BRK> i m well aware of the perception this off season   klentak said   i would shift the focus to the body of work in our off season  we ve spent about    million this off season  we ve spent plenty of money  this is not an ownership that is sitting on it hand and going cheap  <BRK>so far  the phillies  biggest free agent splash wa a three year    million contract for mccutchen     a former most valuable player for the pittsburgh pirate  mccutchen will play left field  with the slugger rhys hoskins shifting back to first base  his best position  carlos santana  who played first base last year  went to the seattle mariner in a deal for segura  who hit    with   steal last season and once led the national league in hit <BRK> i think we have the piece to go a far a we want to  and that s to the championship   mccutchen said   it s a very strong team all around  you look at the lineup and there s some good name in there  and the pitching s unreal  i remember facing these guy when i wa on the giant and looking at the starting rotation and the bullpen  i wa like   man  they ve got some arm  there s no break here   <BRK>in realmuto  who arrived this month in a trade with the miami marlin  the phillies have the major  best catcher  robertson solidifies a deep bullpen  the phillies seem comfortable with their rotation   nola  jake arrieta  nick pivetta  vince velasquez and zach eflin   but if they lose out on harper  they could theoretically upgrade that group <BRK> we are always going to be open minded to opportunity to make our team better   klentak said   but this is not the last free agent class of all time  there will be other opportunity for the philadelphia phillies to spend money in the future  whether it s july at the trade deadline  or next off season  or the off season after that  we have to take that into account <BRK> are there player remaining in free agency that would make u better  are we going to have need next year and are there going to be player in next year s class that we re going to want to sign  yes  we have to balance the short term and the long term in everything that we do  <BRK>the phillies  long term fantay is to sign mike trout if he leaf the los angeles angel a a free agent after the   seaon  but trout  an unabahed philadelphia sport fan from millville  n j   might never hit the open market  and with realmuto under team control for only the next two seaons  the phillies  short term window is open  harper could help them burst through it <BRK> i think we re a good team with or without adding harper   robertson said   obviously  he s a great player and fit in on any roster  who wouldn t want a guy that s capable of hitting   home run and hitting     but you can t look at stuff like that  we re in the now  <BRK>the player seem to understand that  for now  the fan are preoccupied with one guy not in that room  harper <BRK> to me  personally  i don t really care  but i think for the city  they want a guy like that   reliever pat neshek said   with all the talk  i feel like they re expecting one of the two  and now manny s gone  but they re trying their best  they ve made awesome move so far  and the n l  east is going to be tough no matter what  <BRK>it is hard to see clearly now  with the harper haze hanging over the team and the sport  but what if the phillies have done enough already with mccutchen  realmuto  robertson and segura  that is their stance  and they might be right <BRK> in a typical off season  that is a very thorough  complete and successful off season   klentak said   we addressed everything we wanted to address  <BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK>
