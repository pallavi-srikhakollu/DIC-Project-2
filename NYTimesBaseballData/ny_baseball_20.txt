Manny Machado signed a $300 million, 10-year contract with the San Diego Padres, only to be outdone a week later by Bryce Harper, left, who reportedly is signing for 13 years and $330 million with the Philadelphia Phillies.The last time two offensive players of this caliber were free agents at the same time was probably after the 2000 season, when Alex Rodriguez and Manny Ramirez were available. The Rangers signed Rodriguez to a record $252 million, 10-year contract, and the Red Sox landed Ramirez for eight years at $160 million.Whether contracts like these are worth it for teams is open to debate. Rodriguez led the American League in home runs in each of his three seasons with Texas before he and his contract were sent to the Yankees. But the Rangers finished in last place in all three of his seasons there.Ramirez led the American League in homers in 2004, the season in which Boston won its first World Series title since 1918.One way to determine how well big contracts work out for teams is to measure a player’s WAR (wins above replacement) during the years of that contract. WAR is a measure of value that compares how much better (or worse) a player is compared to one who would typically be available to replace him.Harper and Machado are 26 years old. That hits the sweet spot for getting high WAR and better value on contracts of at least $100 million.10AVG. WAR DURING CONTRACT864202425262728293031323334AGE AT START OF CONTRACT10AVG. WAR DURING CONTRACT864202425262728293031323334AGE AT START OF CONTRACTThere have been 72 separate contracts* of at least $100 million before this off-season.Nine of those contracts were given to players who were 26 or younger.Eight of the nine have amassed a robust average WAR of 4.5 or higher during those deals.The remaining 63 contracts were given to players older than 26.Only eight of the 63 are at 4.5 or higher.The chart below includes the players who have played, or are playing, under contracts of at least $100 million. It compares their relative value by using their average yearly salary during the contract and their average yearly WAR during that time.10  AVERAGE YEARLY WAR DURING CONTRACTMike TroutAlbert Pujols(1st contract)8Alex Rodriguez(1st contract)Max ScherzerJ.D.

YEARLY SALARYOF THESE CONTRACTSEvaluating Contracts    While there are many ways to value a player’s contributions, WAR is a single metric aimed at comparing players across different eras, positions and ballparks.No one metric is without its limitations, but there’s little doubt that Albert Pujols’s first $100 million contract worked out a lot better for the Cardinals than the Homer Bailey deal worked out for the Reds.Costing More, Producing Less    Pujols versus Bailey aside, value arguments can be made for and against players in every corner of this chart, even those in the red-highlighted box.The players in the red box cost more per year than the average of all these $100 million players but have produced less than the average WAR of these players.The Worst Deal?    There is a strong case that the Phillies’ contract with Ryan Howard is one of the worst of all. He had a respectable average WAR of 2.4 in the eight seasons before his big contract.But he had a negative WAR in four of the five seasons during the contract. Injuries played a big role in that, but injuries are among the risks of big contracts.There’s Still Time   These contracts are still active, so underperforming players have time to prove their worth. Just ask David Price.The David Price Case   After the first three years of his deal with the Red Sox, David Price is teetering on the edge of the red box. Boston fans had not been very happy with his performance, especially his 0-2 record in the playoffs in the first two seasons with the team.Price’s Redemption    But Price changed a lot of minds in October, going 3-1 in the playoffs and finishing second in the World Series M.V.P. voting. A lot can be forgiven once you hoist the championship trophy.Beware the Second Big Contract   Production, of course, can fall as well, even for the best players. These three signed two separate contracts of $100 million or more. Each was a high-performing player during his first one, but each fell into the red box during his second.No matter how well Harper and Machado perform during the length of their new contracts, teams may want to be careful about offering them another one.* Zack Greinke opted out of his Dodgers contract before $100 million was paid out. We did not include that contract here. We included only his deal with the Diamondbacks. Justin Upton and C.C. Sabathia renegotiated their contracts. We included them only once in these charts. Contracts were not adjusted for inflation. If a player did not play for one or more seasons during the contract, we assigned them a WAR of 0 for those seasons (this includes players who retired before the end of their contract). We did not account for any insurance reimbursements the teams may have received. There are several variations of WAR; we used the version from Baseball-Reference.com.Additional reporting by Tyler KepnerAdvertisement
