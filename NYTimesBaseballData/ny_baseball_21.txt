it wa quickly apparent that the mets  roster  put together mostly from player left unprotected the other national league team  wa a mess  <BRK> left to do the best he could with it wa baseball s most colorful manager  casey stengel  who had won seven world series with the yankee but had been dismissed after the   season  at the age of    because the yankee felt he wa too old  now  he wa even older  but on the mets that hardly mattered because they had plenty of player past their prime  <BRK> stengel  with his amusing  and endless  observation became the perfect narrator for a season of amazingly bad baseball  it began with nine straight loss and it close  the mets had won just   game and lost    the most defeat in a single season in the modern history of baseball  <BRK> adding to the absurdity wa that the mets had two pitcher named bob miller   righty bob miller and lefty bob miller  and a first baeman known a marvelous marv throneberry  with the marvelous meant a a joke  not

before     half frozen fan saw the mets commit three error and permit three stolen base  <BRK> adding to manager casey stengel s misery  roger craig  the starter and losing pitcher  committed a balk that led to one of two st  louis run in the first inning  in addition  the mets bounced into two double play  louis effrat <BRK> polo ground  april   <BRK> civic pride erupted in one lusty ovation after another at the polo ground today a     baeball fan hailed the return of the prodigal national league  <BRK> in the eye of the hurricane of hurrah were the new york mets   a team conceived in frustration and dedicated to the proposition that this teeming metropolis is a two league town a well a a summer festival  <BRK> murky sky  autumn temperature and a relentless drizzle kept the welcoming committee from reaching major league proportion  <BRK> however  what the crowd lacked in number it offset with enthusiasm  generously pouring out affection that had found no satisfactory outlet since the new york giant and brooklyn dodger absconded to the west coast at the close of the   season  <BRK> of those present on this historic friday the  th  only the pittsburgh pirate

were at least four such footnote to baseball s memorabilia  they obscured the mets   th defeat  a dreary     drubbing the chicago cub  <BRK> the saddest of the four is what met official disregard a a  negative statistic   al jackson  one of the two best pitcher on the club  wa clobbered for five run on seven hit during the two and a third inning he pitched  <BRK> the slim left hander wa charged

the brave tonight and wound up with exclusive right to another record  asterisk  footnote and all  <BRK> casey stengel s men suffered their  th defeat  this negative statistic made the mets the losingest baseball team in modern history  the philadelphia athletics of   lost   game  <BRK> the game drew only     fan  the smallest night game turnout since the brave moved to milwaukee  play wa
