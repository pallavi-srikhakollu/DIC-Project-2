<BRK><BRK>the lean year<BRK>the mets still struggled  but they never again reached the depth of    after stengel retired  seaver and koosman arrived <BRK>by the new york time<BRK>the mets were back in the polo ground in   and so were their many fan  who know why everyone showed up  or why so many of them brought banner  but some of the fervor wa just sheer irreverence  the antiestablishment joy of rooting for a team that wa so awful <BRK>and for sure  the mets were terrible again  although this time they managed to win   game instead of    the nuttiest moment came when jimmy piersall ran around the base backward after hitting the  th home run of his career  the most exhilarating occurred when ten of thousand of mets fan invaded yankee stadium for a charity exhibition game against baseball s defending champion  had their banner confiscated and then went berserk anyway when the mets actually won <BRK>a year later  the mets moved to shea stadium  their new home in queen  and took their ineptitude with them  they went      they lost their home opener while creating a massive traffic jam  at the end of may  they lost a doubleheader at shea that went on forever because of a   inning second game that lasted   hour   minute  a record at the time  three week later at shea  the mets were the victim of a perfect game thrown philadelphia s jim bunning <BRK>in    the mets were even worse  winning just   game while also losing casey stengel  who retired after breaking his hip  without stengel  the mets were le entertaining and still stunk  they did move up from last place to ninth in   but then fell right back into  th a year later <BRK>still  that seaon the mets had the rookie of the year in pitcher tom seaver  in    the left hander jerry koosman wa just a impressive in his first seaon  the teammate of seaver and koosman now included other emerging player  like jerry grote and bud harrelson and cleon jones  and it showed in the mets    record   a     mark that still wan t very good but suggested that maybe something wa changing  and something wa <BRK>the journey from hopelessness to champion of the world without having to pas through mediocrity might have been the miracle  and the devil s bargain <BRK>by robert lipsyte<BRK>mocking the mets wa considered cool in the early day of that ragtag expansion franchise becaue it concealed our painfully conflicted true feeling  at the same time that we were deeply ashamed at having been stuck with such a louy team   how could baseball have scammed u like this    we also embraced a lunatic joy at once more feeling major league  after all those year being the only three team city in the show  we hadn t found the yankee enough for u <BRK>so we celebrated the mets in an appropriately early  s way   ironic  self aware  rambunctious  rock ish  the crowd with their made for tv bedsheet banner seemed charmingly self deprecating   we don t want to set the world on fire  we just want to finish ninth   but they also foreshadowed darker time to come   pray    the price of allowing  then encouraging  grandstand populism would eventually be their strident demand <BRK>but those two polo ground year were fun  energized medium member were thrilled with their new job and the west coat trip to visit the dodger and giant that came with them  writer replated the former yankee manager caey stengel a a madcap guru even a he spoke the truth after yet another loss   the attendance wa robbed  we re still a fraud    often with sarcam   come out and see my amazin  mets    a teenager who would never fulfill his hype  ed kranepool  wa held up a the face of the future <BRK>most notorious of all  an inept first baeman  marv throneberry  wa extolled a the symbol of the bumbling present  year later  he told me how miserable he had been a a met  he had entered the big league a a yankee  mickey mantle s heir  no le  after a sensational minor league career  being celebrated a marvelous marv  the mets  fool  broke his spirit <BRK>perhaps the most telling signal that celebrating the  lovable loser  a comforting symbol of  everyman    jut like u    would be short lived wa the creation of  neggies   precursor of the moneyball analytics of today  we needed those negative statistic to prove that the mets were not merely profoundly second rate but actually the worst of all time  so gloriouly bad that we could claim them a champion  inverted champion to be sure  of game lost  chance bobbled  baes missed  hope dahed  for the mets  even mediocrity wa a dream deferred <BRK>but the founding mets writer and fan couldn t paint over the mid   s slump in real american life  the glow of post world war ii triumphalism had given way to the bay of pig  the murderous resistance to civil right activism  mounting cold war anxiety  the assassination of j f k  there wa too much dread  mets fan began to clamor for some win on their scoreboard <BRK>there wa a jolt of hope in   when the mets moved into their home for the next   year  shea stadium  paid for the taxpaying fan  named for a wheeler dealer lawyer  the ballpark wa riddled with imperfection  the team wa even worse  lurching through five more losing season  the mets couldn t even claw their way up to mediocrity <BRK>the so called new breed fan  named and championed the swaggering  righteous daily news columnist dick young  grew restive  beyond the ballpark  the riot and assassination were taking their toll on the public psyche  and the mets  our safety valve  our comic relief  were becoming just another black hole of despair <BRK>and then came tom seaver   fresh  ebullient  hard working  immensely talented  nothing mediocre here  he wa the mets  first homegrown superstar and many of u still think the only one  in    he wa national league rookie of the year  an all star  and a   game winner for a last place club  the next year he again won   game  this time for a ninth place club <BRK>but tom terrific set the world on fire  not only the top gun of a strong young pitching staff   jerry koosman  nolan ryan  gary gentry  tug mcgraw   but the anti marv  he wa the new breed s dream of the new met  a california college boy with a playful cackle who would lead u to the promised pennant in   <BRK>wa it a miracle  don t sport miracle happen suddenly  one hockey game  a shot heard  round the world  a perfect punch  this miracle unspooled through seven year of suffering a preparation for   victory punctuated seaver s    beating the highly favored oriole wa almost anticlimactic  it wa truly about the journey from hopelessness to champion of the world without having to pas through mediocrity  maybe that wa the miracle   and the devil s bargain <BRK>in fact  a case could be made   here it come   that the   world series is still the high point of mets history  that nothing in the next   year came close  the mets lost the   series to oakland and won in   under morally nullifying circumstance  not only did they win because of a red sox error  but a member of that team in his final major league season  at a still serviceable    wa seaver <BRK>he should have still been a met <BRK>in    a contract dispute with the cartoonishly imperious mets chairman  m  donald grant  wa viciously spun dick young into a desperate player wife plot  nancy seaver  he claimed  wanted tom to make more than nolan ryan  a man of dignity  seaver opted out and began an exile s journey to the red  the white sox  briefly back to the mets  then the red sox and finally to his california winery <BRK>the mets went on to lose the world series in   and    each four game to one  failing against the yankee in   doomed the mets to their current fate  only winning the subway series would redeem a history of steady disappointment  their owner have been lackluster  they have managed a record of     victory against     defeat  a    average  not to mention involvement with the ponzi schemer bernie madoff  the closest the mets ever came to a seaverish star wa the talented  handsome  good hearted david wright  unfortunately bedeviled injury <BRK>even now    year after what  yes  must have been a miracle  that glory is tinged with sadness  seaver  a longtime victim of lyme disease  recently announced his withdrawal from public life because of encroaching dementia  the creator of so many of our most amazin  memory  is losing his

for the first time ever <BRK>it is of mere academic interest that the yank actually won more game and finished closer to first place in the american league than the mets did in the national  what count is that in the national league  the chicago cub were worse <BRK>the columbia broadcating system acquired the yankee in   a they were winning their fifth straight pennant  the merger of corporate
