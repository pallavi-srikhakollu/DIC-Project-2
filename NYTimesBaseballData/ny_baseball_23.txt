 <BRK>  <BRK> by kevin draper and kevin armstrong <BRK> when the mets hired brodie van wagenen a their new general manager lat october  they wholly embraced  even promoted  his status a an unconventional outsider   a converted player agent  the team made a similarly unorthodox addition on tuesday  announcing that jessica mendoza  a baeball analyst for espn  would join the team s front office a a baeball operation adviser to van wagenen  <BRK> the mets said mendoza  a softball gold medalist in the   olympic game who joined espn in    would focus on player evaluation  roster construction  and health and performance  but in noting that mendoza also would retain her high profile role on  sunday night baseball  telecast  the announcement gave a new dimension to question about objectivity for espn  the network ha long covered sport while also paying league billion of dollar each year to air them  and it ha increasingly seen it own employee blur the line between covering and participating in sport  <BRK> van wagenen said at a news conference tuesday morning that hiring mendoza furthered the team s effort to shake up the way it doe business  <BRK>  i wa an outside the box hire   van wagenen said   i ve been a believer that you need to get new voice and fresh perspective in any room  especially when you are making decision   <BRK> mendoza     ha a sterling history in softball and baseball  she wa one of the best college softball player ever  and later won a gold medal at the   athens game and a silver in    she ha been with espn for about   year and became a color analyst on  sunday night baseball    the network s flagship baseball program   in    <BRK> while mendoza will evaluate player and provide input on roster construction  van wagenen said she would be especially influential in the area of health and performance and technology  he also said she would work for the mets during baseball s annual general manager and winter meeting in the off season  suggesting her role would be more consequential than those of others   including the ex yankee alex rodriguez   who are both broadcaster and adviser for team  <BRK> mendoza s deal with the mets includes a confidentiality agreement  van wagenen said  adding that she would not share on her broadcast  anything she gleans from our operation   she also will not be allowed to share with the mets anything she learns about other team through her espn duty  mendoza will be in the mets  training camp in port st  lucie  fla   on friday  <BRK> espn ha long had a revolving door between the playing field and the broadcast booth  just last week  jason witten left  monday night football  to return to his n f l  playing career  one year after jon gruden did the same to return to coaching  <BRK> still  mendoza s hire is different  she is perhaps espn s highest profile baseball voice  one of the network s most important employee on it most important baseball broadcast  she is currently scheduled to be in the booth for a june game between the mets and atlanta brave  <BRK> espn shrugged off suggestion of conflict of interest  and argued that mendoza wa far from the first baeball broadcater to navigate such concern   there are numerous example across network of these type of arrangement where commentator work closely with team  and we will be fully transparent about jessica s relationship with the mets   said josh krulewitz  an espn spokesman   we have complete faith in her ability a a leading m l b  voice for espn   <BRK> espn s relationship with baseball is especially intimate  the network also employ rodriguez  who is a special adviser for the yankee  and david ross  a special assistant for the cub  on tuesday  espn also announced that the yankee pitcher c â€‰c  sabathia would contribute to various espn television show this season  mostly in coverage of sport other than baseball  <BRK> other network have similar situation  the retired baeball player frank thoma and david ortiz  who both work for fox  also have role with their old team  but van wagenen s insistence that mendoza would have input on important baeball decision seems to set her apart from other broadcater  or ex player  role a  special adviser   a role that tends to be more ceremonial than substantive  ross and rodriguez are not listed a part of the front office on their respective team  website  and thoma is an adviser for business operation  when ortiz s role wa announced  he focused on his duty of recruiting free agent and making community appearance  <BRK> like espn  the mets are accustomed to the revolving door in the baeball industry  van wagenen wa hired from creative artist agency  where he represented mets star like jacob degrom and yoenis cespedes  in taking the job  van wagenen divested himself from his stake in c a a   and he ha said that he will recuse himself from any contract negotiation with pat client  including degrom  if that wan t confusing enough  mendoza is also represented c a a  and then there s tim tebow  working his way up through the mets  minor league rank while remaining with espn a a college football analyst  <BRK> kevin draper reported from new york  and kevin armstrong from port st  lucie  fla  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
