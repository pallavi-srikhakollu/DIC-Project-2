 <BRK>  <BRK> by tyler kepner and james wagner <BRK> a lot ha changed for christian yelich in a year  especially since nov     when he wa named the national league most valuable player  he ha been on the road for nearly two week this winter  an off season circuit of photo shoot  award show and interview  on saturday  he wa in manhattan to formally accept the m v p  plaque at the annual new york baseball writer  dinner  <BRK> around this time lat year  yelich wa a young and talented but not so well known outfielder for the dysfunctional and eternally changing miami marlin  a part of a team fire sale  he wa traded to the milwaukee brewer on jan        he produced a dazzling seaon  particularly in the second half when he hit a if he had unlocked the cheat code to a video game  he finished with a n l  best    average and     on bae plus slugging percentage  plus a career high   home run and   run batted in  <BRK> he led the surprising brewer  the team in the smallest market in the country  to the n l  central title  they came to within one game of the world series  falling to the big spending los angeles dodger in game   of the n l  championship series  yelich  a native of the los angeles area  received   of   first place vote for the m v p  award  <BRK> yelich     stopped the new york time on friday to answer some question about his big year  the business of baseball and the wildfire relief charity  california strong  that he helped create with several other major leaguers  this interview ha been edited and condensed for clarity  <BRK> baseball player generally don t have renown of football or basketball player  why are you doing this post m v p  medium tour  <BRK> it s important  not only for yourself  but for the game  if you ve been blessed to be in a position and put on the field to speak out on these topic  a far a california strong or the direction the game is headed  obviously you want to bring a much attention to the game a possible and grow baeball a much a you can  it s important  it come with the responsibility that being a league m v p  come with  i m just learning on the fly  trying to the best i can  <BRK> is there something culturally different about baseball that discourages player speaking out like they do in the n f l  or n b a   why don t you see that much activism  or player inserting themselves into the political or culture conversation  <BRK> i don t think it s a conscious effort not to be engaged in that stuff  you still see a lot of baseball player doing good  at the end of the day  when you re trying to do good  that s all that matter  whether it s in a different aspect than in the n b a  or n f l   you should use your platform for good  <BRK> how is the california strong campaign going  you said you ve raised      million  <BRK> it all started wa basically a group text with ryan braun  mike moustakas and  the son of the brewer  owner  mike attanasio  just basically trying to find information on if everybody s house were o k  since everyone had to be evacuated  information wa kind of minimal  once we found out that everyone wa o k   it kind of turned into  how can we help  we thought we needed to give back  because the borderline shooting happened basically a few hour before that night when all the fire started  so we thought about doing something to give back to the hometown and help get people back on their foot  <BRK> the n l c s  wa mostly on a cable network  fox sport    while the a f c  and n f c  title game in the n f l  were more widely watched on fox and cbs  do you think baseball need more of a national audience  <BRK> i don t think baseball is ever going to be the fast paced game that football or basketball is  it s never going to be constant action  that s never how the game is played  with player being allowed to express themselves a little bit more freely on the field  there s also been a bigger push for them to be on social medium to sharing their life and personality  it s going to attract the younger fan because they re going to feel like they re engaged and maybe a little bit more invested in these player because they know them a little better  and when there s a game like that  they tune in and see how their favorite player or team doe  <BRK> what s life like after winning an m v p    <BRK> it is different and everything changed one afternoon  basically  there is the show and the announcement and then everything is completely different the next day  you just take it in stride and it s not anything that s been overwhelming or i can t handle this  it s not like that any mean  but it s definitely been a lot of fun  <BRK> ha there been much chatter between you  your teammate or other player about the slow free agent market or how two superstar  bryce harper and manny machado  remain unsigned  <BRK> we talk about it  i don t want to share exactly what those conversation are  they re two of the best player that we have in the game right now  the process hasn t played out  player talk  i d like to leave it at that  <BRK> this pat seaon wa the first in which there were more strikeout than hit  it s an issue with the commissioner s office  they d like to see more hit and more action  do you see it a a problem  <BRK> i don t know how you solve it  but you ve definitely seen an increae in velocity year year  there s been an emphais on the whole launch angle thing and pitcher combating that with throwing fatball up in the zone  there s been a greater push on analytics and team to look into it and how to get guy out  hitter have that a well  but hitting ha always been hard  hitting a baeball is still incredibly hard  it s just one of those thing where hitter have to make an adjustment and we have to find a way  since i ve been in the league for part of six year  you can tell already the difference a far a just the amount of power arm you face on a nightly and daily bais  <BRK> given the oversaturation of statistic and measurement in baseball  what do you look at to evaluate your own performance  <BRK> i feel like probably the biggest one is o p s  it s the biggest stat that people take value from in the game  from the people who evaluate it and the people who play it  just because it s slugging and on base   two of the thing that make up a productive baseball player  we ve gotten away from batting average a little bit  i still think batting average is important  other people will tell you it s not anymore in the game  but you don t want to make out  basically  you still have to get on base and be productive  somehow getting on base and getting a hit are really not that big of a deal  it s still really hard to get a hit in the big league  whether it s a single or homer  there s still something that can be said for that  you ve seen that  where the game ha gotten away from it  where it s become acceptable to hit    or    and hit   homer  <BRK> every hit almost feel like a miracle because pitcher are throwing so hard  do you ever sit back and think  this is a really freakish skill i have  <BRK> sometime it feel a lot harder than other time  there s time when you re in the on deck circle or on the bench and you re like   i have no shot  i don t know how i m going to do this but i ve got to figure it out   and other time you re more locked in and it doesn t feel a hard  it s the same feeling every spring training when the pitcher are throwing their bullpen or live batting practice and you re like   oh man  this might be the year i go   for    i don t know how i m going to do this   and then you get back to the process  i feel like  from the side or in the dugout  this guy is throwing is so hard  and then when you get in there  it s not really what you think it is because you re so used to it  it just slows down every day when you re in there  <BRK> in the second half last year  did the ball look like a beach ball to you  <BRK> there are time even during that second half where there were week stretch where it kind of leaf you and doesn t feel right  but it come back quicker  when you go on stretch like that  there s still time where it doesn t feel great but it still come back to you quicker  some year  you re constantly searching for  it    and  it  is different for everybody  <BRK> can you purposefully foul off a pitch  <BRK> i can t  i feel like the only guy that probably could purposefully foul off a ball is     who do you think  <BRK> ichiro  <BRK> no  but he might be one of the guy  but i wa going to say joey votto  i haven t talked to joey about this  but i feel like sometimes joey is up there just trying to walk and he s just trying to foul the ball off until he walk  <BRK> do you guess at the plate  <BRK> i don t like to guess  just react  some guy are guess hitter  i just could never do it  if you guess and guess wrong  you have no shot of hitting anything else  <BRK> when you look back on your childhood  what do you think wa a difference maker in term of allowing you to become an elite athlete in term of your development   <BRK> the most important thing for kid would baically be have fun and enjoy it  travel ball ha become a business and not a much fun for kid these day  they think their kid are getting scouted when they re      or   year old  you should just enjoy the game at this point in your life  why is there any pressure to play well when you re      or    it doesn t matter if you hit five homer or strike out five time in a game  the milwaukee brewer are not watching your travel ball game right now and saying   johnny is a first round pick and we re taking him this year   <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
