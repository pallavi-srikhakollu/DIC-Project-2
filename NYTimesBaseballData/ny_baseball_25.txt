   more than any other player  he set the tone for the mets  transformation into champion <BRK>jerry koosman wa the left handed complement to seaver and the two of them formed the most powerful pitching tandem in the major league in    he wa not named the most valuable player of the world series  but he could have been  going  ⅔ strong inning in game   to get the mets even with the oriole and then going all   inning in game   to give the mets the most unlikely of championship <BRK>cleon jones wa born on aug        five day before tommie agee  below  and the two of them grew up playing sport together in mobile  ala   before becoming outfield partner on the mets   jones in left  agee in center  in    jones hit     drove in   run  and wa the best player in the mets  lineup  it wa jones who started the winning rally in the final game of the world series  with an eighth inning double <BRK>agee s first season in new york     wa a disaster  but   wa a different story     home run while batting leadoff  a    average  great catch in the world series  agee and jones did have a close call in the n l c s  when agee  attempting to steal home  nearly got hit a line drive off jones s

extremely well  a such  his offensive number that year      average    r b i    were almost a footnote <BRK>it wa the consistently solid defense provided bud harrelson  at shortstop  and grote behind the plate that became a subtle source of strength for the   mets  that season  harrelson batted a modest    with no home run    double and just   r b i  but that hardly mattered  far more significant wa the role he played in the field  he weighed only   pound  but he wa the anchor <BRK>gil hodges projected strength in his size and his quiet determination  and his player  many of them in their mid  s  took heed  if the   mets had a pillar  it wa hodges  he wa still the mets manager when he died of a heart attack in   at age   <BRK>al wei shared second bae with ken boswell a part of a righty lefty combo and wa one of the weakest hitter in the   lineup  still  he hit a big home run in july to help beat the cub and an even bigger one in the final game of the world series <BRK>ed charles s nickname wa the glider for the way he moved on defense at third base  and that defense wa vital in the ninth inning of game   of the world series when  with the oriole threatening  he snared a hard ground ball and threw to first for the final out  charles died in   at the age of   <BRK>a a rookie in    ron swoboda hit   home run  but   he wa a platoon player  even so  he continued to work hard on his outfield defense and in the  th inning of game   of the world series he made one of the great catch ever <BRK>duffy dyer wa the third catcher in    which meant his playing time wa limited  still  in just   at bat he hit effectively   a    average    home run    r b i  and he caught one game of the mets           doubleheader sweep against the pirate on sept    <BRK>wayne garrett and ed charles formed the lefty righty platoon at third bae  a a rookie in    garrett hit only one home run in the regular seaon  but he hit a two run blat in game   of the n l c s  against the brave <BRK>an original met  ed kranepool got six at bat in   when he wa just    he wa still a met when he retired after the   season  in the middle came    when he platooned at first base with donn clendenon and homered in game   of the world series <BRK>ken boswell wa a formidable hitter from the left side who batted    in   while manning second base with al wei  it wa boswell who singled in the winning run

shamsky shared right field with ron swoboda  a righty  and shamsky thrived in that platoon in    batting    in   game with   home run and   r b i  even better  he hit       of    against the brave in the n l c s <BRK>gary gentry wa a rookie pitcher in   and an instant workhorse    start   ⅔ inning  a     record  a     e r a  he also won game   of the world series  amos otis  a rookie outfielder
