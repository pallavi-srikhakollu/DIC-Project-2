<BRK><BRK>  american league preview<BRK>lat year s division champion   boston  cleveland and houston   seem poised to repeat  but the yankee  a s  angel  twin and ray loom a challenger <BRK>by tyler kepner<BRK>the houston atros blitzed through their first four playoff game lat october  including the opener of the american league championhip series at fenway park in boston  then they lost four in a row to the red sox  who went on to replace them a world series champion <BRK>george springer  the most valuable player of the   world series  did not watch a moment of boston s triumph over the los angeles dodger  he wa not despondent  though  he wa simply taking time for himself after a largely satisfying season <BRK> a lot of people think when you lose you re sitting at home all destroyed for a long time  but a lot ha to go right to get where we got the previous year   springer said this spring at the astros  training complex in west palm beach  fla   we just got beat  one of the thing about this game is you ve got to be able to accept failure  we didn t have a bad year  we lost in the a l c s  you move on  <BRK> m l b  season preview  stuffed to it seam <BRK>the astros never expected to string together championship  general manager jeff luhnow  who often make blackjack analogy  understands that sometimes  the card will not flip his way  but the astros keep getting a seat at the table and tipping the odds in their favor <BRK>they turned to the free agent market to find an ideal fit for their lineup  michael brantley  the former cleveland left fielder who signed a two year     million deal  brantley is a lefty in a right leaning lineup  and a premier contact hitter who accentuates what the astros do best <BRK>houston ranked sixth in the major in run last season  and only the indian  hitter had fewer strikeout  brantley had   extra base hit and the second lowest strikeout percentage in the major  trailing only the los angeles angel  andrelton simmons <BRK> good thing happen when you put the ball in play   said brantley  who struck out only   time in   plate appearance   rally can start with an error or a miscommunication on a fly ball  you don t know how  you look around this locker room  not too many guy strike out in this lineup  we put the ball in play hard and take our chance  <BRK>opponent could make up a bit more ground against houston this season  the astros  pitcher led the major in strikeout  but the team subsequently lost charlie morton to free agency and lance mccullers jr  to tommy john surgery  both averaged at least   strikeout per nine inning  to fill those spot   and the one left the unsigned free agent dallas keuchel   the astros will use collin mchugh  wade miley and brad peacock or framber valdez  with power arm waiting in the high minor <BRK> we re a pretty complete team  and that sometimes brings question   manager a j  hinch said   i understand why they re there  but they don t necessarily have to be there  we have five really good starting pitching candidate and we have some youngster that are coming fast  the rotation s not keeping me up at night  <BRK>hinch can rest easy  there may be no clear favorite among the power team in this league  but the astros look like the safest bet to push through to the world series <BRK>they have far more depth than their rival in the a l  west  the oakland athletics  who won   game last season  are like the buddy in your fantasy league who load up on some category but ignores others  in this case  the a s have lot of slugger  reliever and star defender  but no semblance of a rotation <BRK>the a s are good enough in those area to at least contend  assuming a strong return the gold glove winning first baseman matt olson  who will miss six week after breaking a bone in his right hand on the team s trip to japan  a rotator cuff strain to jesus luzardo  their top pitching prospect  hurt their depth  but if the a s have a chance  they will find a way to make shrewd addition  one thing is certain  designated hitter khris davis   the major  home run leader since     will bat     it ha been his precise average in each of the last four season <BRK>the los angeles angel have committed about    million to center fielder mike trout through    that give them plenty of time to find a way to finally win a playoff game with the game s best player on their roster  they think it could happen this fall <BRK> we re going to be a strong offensive club  we re going to increae our on bae percentage  and our home run are going to be there again this year   general manager billy eppler said   a a lot of club can say  health is going to be very  very important to u  we ve been the example of what can happen to a club when you don t have good health  if we can get north of   start out of our starter  we re going to be in a really  really good position  <BRK>for the angel  that could be aking too much  their starter have a dubious health history  and adding matt harvey a a free agent most likely won t alter that trend  andrew heaney ha had elbow inflammation in spring training  and tyler skaggs dealt with forearm fatigue  shohei ohtani will hit this seaon  but his recovery from tommy john surgery will keep him off the mound <BRK>the team that truly taunted the pitching god  though  is the texas ranger  all four of their new starter   lance lynn  shelby miller  drew smyly and edinson volquez   have had tommy john surgery in the last three and a half year <BRK> n l  preview  a deep talent pool should keep the dodger afloat <BRK> it help  becaue we can lean on each other   hey  do you feel this  what do you do between start    said smyly  who spent the last two season with seattle and the chicago cub  yet never threw a pitch for either team   but at the same time  i think all of u are over talking about it  we jut want to put it behind u and go play again  <BRK>the ranger  likewise  are eager to bury their recent pat  their   loss lat seaon matched their most since    their hope for improvement rest on young hitter like joey gallo  ronald guzman  nomar mazara and rougned odor  who strike out too much but could break into stardom a the team prepares to move to a new arlington ballpark   with a retractable roof   next seaon <BRK>the seattle mariner made a noble effort to end baseball s longest playoff drought  since     but they should now replace the ranger in the division cellar  they allowed   more run than they scored last season but still finished   game over     recognizing the anomaly  general manager jerry dipoto spent the winter dumping robinson cano  nelson cruz  edwin diaz  james paxton  jean segura  mike zunino and others <BRK>some veteran  like jay bruce and edwin encarnacion  came back a part of salary swap  but dipoto  baeball s most active general manager  could trade them this summer in an effort to build a more stable foundation <BRK>encarnacion came to seattle in a trade with the cleveland indian  who shed   of the   player who appeared in their three game division series loss to the astros  those   player will earn more than    million for their new team this season  and the indian added few veteran replacement besides carlos santana and carlos gonzalez <BRK>the indian won t win the division without major contribution from shortstop francisco lindor  who wa slowed this spring a calf injury  and third baseman jose ramirez  who hit    from last aug    through the end of the playoff  but their rotation is so dominant that they should still have enough offense to get <BRK>only   major leaguers worked   inning while recording   strikeout last season  and four were indian  corey kluber  trevor bauer  carlos carrasco and mike clevinger  with those starter and the all star closer brad hand  the indian should win the central for the fourth year in a row <BRK>the minnesota twin  under new manager rocco baldelli  are the only team that could catch them  the twin added the veteran nelson cruz  marwin gonzalez  c j  cron and jonathan schoop to their lineup  and a progressive new pitching coach   wes johnson  who came from the university of arkansas   should help them get more from their staff <BRK>to win  though  the twin need more from their talented but erratic young core  jose berrios  byron buxton  max kepler  jorge polanco  eddie rosario and miguel sano  all should be in their prime  and the twin would like to stop guessing how good they can be <BRK> you can dream a lot on the potential upside of that group  and you see spurt of it   said derek falvey  the twin  president for baseball operation   the key  in my mind  is how do you get all those guy firing together at the same time  because if you do  that s a really talented crew  and we haven t quite seen the potential of that entire group all working at the same time  <BRK>even if they cannot catch cleveland  the twin could claim a wild card feasting on the weak in the division  the bottom three team each lost at least   game last season  and none have done much to improve <BRK>while the chicago white sox flirted with bryce harper and manny machado in free agency  they still have never given a free agent contract richer than    million  they are deep in prospect  but some of the most promising one from last spring   infielder yoan moncada and starter lucas giolito   were major disappointment in the summer  eloy jimenez  an electrifying rookie outfielder who signed a six year     million contract in late march  will try to change that <BRK>the kansa city royal should at least be interesting in the way they deploy the speedsters whit merrifield  billy hamilton and adalberto mondesi  three of the   major leaguers with more than   stolen base last year  this will be a painstaking rebuilding process  but the last one resulted in two pennant and the   world series title <BRK>the detroit tiger owe miguel cabrera    million for the next five season  a staggering figure for a player who turn   in april and missed most of last season with a ruptured biceps tendon  he s a future hall of famer  and a renaissance season     home run   would give cabrera   for his career  but there s not much else to draw interest <BRK>the tiger  former architect  dave dombrowski  is now the president for baseball operation for the boston red sox and in    he earned the championship he could never quite get in detroit  it s fair to expect the red sox to repeat in the east  but no team ha successfully defended a world series title since the   yankee <BRK> there s a lot of reaon behind that  but first and foremost it s tough to win  period   dombrowski said   you get a lot of break when you win  even having a good club  you need a break here or there  sometimes  you just don t get a many  <BRK>the red sox lost no significant player from the major  best offense  and re signed the postseaon star nathan eovaldi to keep their rotation intact  starter chris sale  david price  rick porcello  eovaldi and eduardo rodriguez cannot double a reliever in the regular seaon a they did lat october  but the offense and rotation should make up for an imperfect bullpen <BRK> on a nightly basis  the guy on the mound is going to go give u a chance to win the game   manager alex cora said   they go six or seven  and we know offensively who we are  it s a good feeling  <BRK>unless the yankee reach the world series this year  the  s will be their first decade since the  s without at least one a l  pennant  their last wa in    when they won their  th title <BRK> it ha flown  man  but it s been way too long   said outfielder brett gardner  the longest tenured yankee   from the front office to the ownership  they go out of their way to put the best possible team on the field every year and it s been a disappointing   year  <BRK>the yankee very well could reach the world series  but they might have to start hosting the wild card game for the third year in a row  the volume of injury this spring   dellin betances  didi gregorius  aaron hick  c c  sabathia  luis severino   could be easier to handle because of a forgiving early schedule  the yankee play   of their first   game against baltimore  the white sox  detroit  kansa city and san francisco <BRK>the yankee  lineup will be fearsome  and their bullpen  with betances  zach britton  adam ottavino  chad green and aroldis chapman  will lock down   victory or more  expect a back and forth pennant race with boston all summer <BRK>can the tampa bay ray elbow into the chase  they won   game last season  partly defying conventional pitching role with their opener strategy  an innovation that sprang from a logical premise <BRK> the whole goal is  how can we maximize the talent of our player and how can we put them in a position to succeed   and put u in a position to win a much a possible   said chaim bloom  the ray  senior vice president for baeball operation   our group in the clubhoue ha really high expectation  and so do we  <BRK>the ray plan to use two opener every five day  they could follow the opener with a so called  bulk guy   one pitcher who work the bulk of the middle inning  or a parade of reliever  but they need their traditional starter   charlie morton  tyler glasnow and the cy young award winner blake snell   to produce <BRK> reliable starter are the key to letting u do the opener   manager kevin cash said   not to put added pressure on them  but if we get good starting pitching  we can be a little bit more aggressive on the other day and mix and match a little bit more  <BRK>fan of the toronto blue jay will start the season pining for third baseman vladimir guerrero jr  and shortstop bo bichette  whose father combined to play nearly     game in the major  guerrero and bichette   dante s son   have played none  but both are top   prospect on baseball america s list <BRK>guerrero     wa overweight at the start of spring training and then strained an oblique muscle  bichette     wa hitting    in exhibition game when he wa sent to minor league camp  when the new manager  charlie montoyo  can write both name on a lineup card in toronto  this rebuild will accelerate <BRK>the baltimore oriole also have a new manager  brandon hyde  and a new general manager  mike elia  hyde came from the chicago cub and elia from the astros  so both have seen the payoff from patient roster makeover  they ll need a lot of patience in baltimore  where the oriole just endured a franchise record   loss  elia understands the magnitude of the task <BRK> it s a challenge i m looking forward to  but we do have titan in our division year in and year out   elia said   we ve got two really good farm system and front office in toronto and tampa bay  a well  so all four of our division competitor are mighty  we re going to have to be very shrewd and draft and sign and develop very well  <BRK>tyler kepner ha been national baseball writer since    he joined the time in   and covered the mets for two season  then covered the yankee from   to      tylerkepner <BRK><BRK>
