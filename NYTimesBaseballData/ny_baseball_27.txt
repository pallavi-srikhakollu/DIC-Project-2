 <BRK>  <BRK> by james wagner <BRK> tampa  fla    when the yankee  young slugger aaron judge look up and down the team s roster  he see many player like him  there s the soon to be   year old third baseman  miguel andujar  who wa the runner up for the american league rookie of the year award last season   just ahead of a teammate  second baseman gleyber torres     <BRK> the opening day battery will most likely consist of   year old luis severino  the staff ace  on the mound and gary sanchez     crouched behind the plate  the heart of the lineup will include judge     already one of baseball s most recognizable star after only two full season  <BRK>  we re going to be set for quite a few year to be doing a lot of good thing in new york   judge said at the yankee  spring training base here  <BRK> after year of being carried older player or building rapidly through free agency  the yankee now have their best core of young player since the day of derek jeter  jorge posada  mariano rivera  andy pettitte and bernie williams coming up through the team s system  <BRK> and while judge is understandably optimistic about his team s odds of competing for a world series title  it is already fair to wonder how long this core group of player will remain together   and at what cost  <BRK> the yankee  decision maker  of course  have already been weighing these question  the biggest hint the yankee are already thinking ahead came this month  the four year     million extension  which could extend to five year  given to severino  and they have approached other key player  like outfielder aaron hick and relief pitcher dellin betances  about possible extension   which will weigh much heavier on the yankee  payroll than their current deal  <BRK>  there s going to be payday coming down  and we have to prepare for those   said brian cashman  the yankee  longtime general manager  <BRK> the yankee did not seriously pursue the star free agent manny machado for many reason  his asking price  he signed for   year and    million with the san diego padre   a desire to spend money in several area of the roster instead of just a few  and the fact that they already posse a talented third baseman  andujar  and a huge contract  most of giancarlo stanton s   year     million deal   <BRK> but one factor wa the financial future of their own young standouts  to borrow cashman s phrasing  every dollar affect somebody else s dollar  <BRK>  everything is connected   he said   our payroll continue to increae  and we re preparing and have been preparing for that a these player that we think are very special continue their journey   <BRK> it might seem unusual for the yankee  who are valued forbes at    billion and had a tradition of chaing the best free agent regardless of price under the former owner george steinbrenner  to be concerned about the future salary of their player  but since steinbrenner s heyday  baeball ha implemented rule that limit spending in the amateur draft or the international market and a luxury tax that team generally treat a a hard cap  <BRK> that is not to say the yankee couldn t afford to pursue high priced free agent and retain their young star  but jim duquette  a former mets general manager  said the highest luxury tax penalty could be a legitimate deterrent  even for team a wealthy a the yankee   the red sox paid    million in penalty for their    million payroll in   and will be penalized in the   draft  but it helped them win lat year s world series   <BRK>  to be able to handle the luxury tax penalty in these large market  you have to grow your own player   duquette said   and if you re competitive  you re picking at the low end of the draft  and it s hard to hit on the aaron judge of the world down at the  s in the first round  where they drafted him  <BRK>  so when you have a core like the yankee   this strategy make sense  they absolutely could afford to pay the tax  but the penalty is what make it somewhat prohibitive   <BRK> last year wa the first time since the luxury tax wa put in place in   that the yankee avoided penalty  having dropped under the    million threshold  after being first or second in end of year payroll ranking for decade  the yankee had a    million payroll that ranked sixth in baseball  according to cot s baseball contract   <BRK> the yankee  estimated payroll for luxury tax purpose this season is    million  over the first tax threshold of    million  according to rosterresource com   but some relief is on the horizon with hefty contract  like jacoby ellsbury s  coming off the book in two year and c c  sabathia retiring after this season  <BRK> but big payouts also loom  judge and sanchez  among others  will see big jump in pay in    when they become eligible for salary arbitration   hence the yankee  stated desire to consider multiyear deal for their arbitration eligible player or pending free agent player  <BRK>  free agency is tough   duquette said   it s hit or miss  if you like your player and know they fit in the organization and play well in new york  then why not try to keep them together   <BRK> in a labor market that seems increaingly tilted toward the club  player no longer see free agency a the hallowed ground they once dreamed about  since drug testing began  team are increaingly wary of player  production after age    and one effect ha been an increaing number of player signing deal considered team friendly before reaching free agency  <BRK> the yankee have broached extension talk with betances and hick  both of whom are set to become free agent after this season  both declined to elaborate on the level of the discussion but said they would be interested in remaining with the yankee  <BRK>  it s an amazing place with a great future and  of course  it s something i d like to be a part of   hick said  <BRK> both are intriguing case  hick ha blossomed in new york after being acquired in a   trade  putting together the best season of his career the past two year  he had a career high   home run and   run batted in despite only playing   game last season  but he ha dealt with several injury and will be a free agent at    <BRK> drafted and developed the yankee  betances ha been one of the best and most durable reliever in baseball  since    he ha a     e r a   better than all but four relief pitcher  what may work against betances is his age  he will be   during the   season  and his workload  his surgically repaired arm ha thrown a lot   <BRK>  nowadays  middle reliever are getting a lot of love   betances said  this off seaon alone  setup men such a jeurys familia and joe kelly  a well a betances  teammate adam ottavino and zack britton  all scored contract of at leat    million  <BRK> another pending free agent the yankee like  shortstop didi gregorius  who ha also improved since his trade to new york in    to go along with stout defense  gregorius ha hit    and averaged   home run over the past three year  but he will be   next season  and his recovery from tommy john surgery will most likely cut his   season in half  <BRK> judge and sanchez will make at leat the league minimum of      this seaon  the yankee may wait until next winter to begin long term contract talk with the two  a they did with severino  <BRK>  i m focused on the season and i haven t heard anything   judge said last week when asked if the yankee had approached about his contract future  <BRK> coming off a rough   season  sanchez would seem unlikely to entertain long term offer now  but will judge feel some impulse to cash in on his earning power relatively soon  given that he will not be a free agent until before his age   season in    or will he wait to see how the market change when the current collective bargaining agreement  which ha increasingly drawn the ire of player  expires in december    <BRK> in severino s case  if the yankee pick up his    million option for    he will be a free agent entering his age   season  for the time being  severino seems perfectly happy with having secured a new deal  <BRK>  it give me a lot of confidence   he said   every time i got to the gym  i ll be smiling  it s a lot security for my family   <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
