 <BRK>  <BRK> by brad lefton <BRK> tokyo   major league baseball began it   season on wednesday in japan with the first of two game between the oakland athletics and the seattle mariner at the tokyo dome  but don t say they are playing on foreign soil  <BRK> that s because   ton of clay  silt and sand mixture were shipped boat from the united state to make the batter s box  pitcher s mound  bae pit and bullpen feel like home  the dirt swap wa news to the veteran seattle pitcher mike leake  who nonetheless gave his stamp of approval after starting the first of two exhibition game each club played against team from japan s nippon professional baeball a a tuneup  <BRK>  oh  you mean we weren t pitching on the same mound the japanese team use during their season   leake said sunday   it felt like the same mound that we pitch on in the state  the only thing i would say is that maybe they put a little too much water at first  so some of the clay stuck to my spike in the first inning  but that happens at home  too  after that  it wa perfect   <BRK> for murray cook and his traveling crew of three  that is the highest praise  cook ha been a consultant for m l b  on field construction and maintenance for nearly three decade  and he serf a the unofficial head groundskeeper for any league sanctioned event played on a diamond not ordinarily manicured one of it   team  <BRK>  the commissioner s office and player  association have a big plan to develop the game worldwide and with that they need field   said cook  who is also the president of the commercial landscaper brightview s sport turf division in pennsylvania   so i get tasked with these fun project from them to create these canvas for the player to go out and perform   <BRK> he wa quite familiar with the stadium for wednesday s game  the fifth time m l b  had opened a season at the tokyo dome   the most of any ballpark outside it   member stadium in north america  a packed crowd of     came out to see what is likely to be ichiro suzuki s final pro appearance in japan  the fan were treated to an offensive showcase won the mariner       <BRK> it wa a different story in    when the chicago cub and the mets split a pair of game here in the first regular season game outside north america  <BRK> aside from thrilling play like benny agbayani s extra inning  pinch hit grand slam for the mets  that series included embarrassing moment that baseball would prefer not to repeat  robin ventura twice slipped in a batter s box that wa made of the softer dirt used in japanese baseball  <BRK> player described it a similar to the loose soil used with potted plant  and it caused more headache when an all star team came over for a postseaon tour in    roger clemens s foot wa sore and dontrelle willis developed pain in his back  cook said  because they were sliding more than usual on the pitcher  mound  <BRK> cook wa camping with his family in the blue ridge mountain when the league summoned him to japan in an emergency  <BRK>  they were all complaining about how soft the mound were   cook recalled   i said   well  we can fix that   i came over and whipped up a concoction that got them through the rest of that tournament   <BRK> since then  the league ha taken greater step to ensure that leake s experience is the norm  cook estimated he had been to tokyo four time since the game were announced last spring  in between  he spent time in london  mexico  new zealand  the dominican republic and peru   among other place   to work on field for game  clinic and other event over the past year  his challenge is to ensure that wherever the game is taking place  the field is always up to m l b  s competitive and safety standard  <BRK> there are plenty of other issue to address besides the dirt  for this series  cook s work began on march   and included helping lay a new  previously planned artificial turf surface at the arena  the base used in japan are also fluffier and rise to a crown  while american base are harder and flatter  they also anchor into the base pit differently  so cook not only ha to bring base from home but also ha to change the hole into which they are fitted  <BRK> japan also us   permanent nylon marker   four around each batter s box and four around the catcher s box   a guide for laying chalk line around those space  in the united state  a metal template is brought out before each game for the marking  in pat event here  m l b  catcher complained that the half inch high tuft were distracting  and they would pull them out of the ground and toss them away  cook now store one of his metal template at the tokyo dome  along with an array of other handy supply  <BRK> cook s job may be easier in japan than it is almost anywhere else because of baseball s deep history here  the   ton of dirt for this series is a smaller shipment than previous one because he ha been able to find suitable domestic material to complement his imported soil  <BRK> but when the yankee and the red sox play a series at london stadium in june   m l b  s first regular season game in europe   cook will need to export   ton of dirt to england to build a field entirely from scratch  <BRK> with his vast experience  cook will be up to the task  but he noted that there wa one item in his field conversion process that still bedevils him  <BRK> while he ha become an expert in the nuance of importing american soil product through custom in many country  he estimated that japanese security agent had confiscated seven metal tape measure from him over the year  this week  he vowed  he would remember to tuck it into his checked luggage after the mariner and the a s are finished  <BRK> an earlier version of this article inaccurately described the significance of game between the cub and the mets in japan in    they were the first regular season m l b  game played outside north america  not the first played outside the united state and canada  a   series wa held in mexico  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
