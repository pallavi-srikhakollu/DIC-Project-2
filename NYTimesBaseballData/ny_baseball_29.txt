 <BRK>  <BRK>   national league preview <BRK> los angeles ha a strong chance to become the first team since the   yankee to lose two world series in a row and return for a third try  <BRK> by tyler kepner <BRK> the final out of the last world series exemplified the los angeles dodger  resourcefulness and torment  the year before  they had lost the world series to the houston astros when their star shortstop  corey seager  grounded out to end game    last fall  long after seager had been lost for the season to injury  his replacement  manny machado  struck out to clinch the title for the boston red sox  <BRK> the dodger simply excel at talent acquisition  loading their roster with more solid player   and the occasional superstar   than any other team in the major  yet they ve suffered the indignity of losing the last two world series on their home field  <BRK> those defeat may obscure just how good the dodger really are  they have a strong chance to become the first team since the   yankee to lose two world series in a row and return for a third try   <BRK>  lat year wa probably the most talented team i ve ever been around  but it didn t necessarily perform like that on a nightly bais   said andrew friedman  the dodger  president for baeball operation   we led the n l  in run scored  we led the n l  in fewest run allowed  but it wa jut kind of the choppiness of it  for u  a lot of it is how to be a consistent a we can be  bring our talent to the forefront a many night a we possibly can   <BRK>  m l b  season preview  stuffed to it seam  <BRK> talent wa everywhere on the roster last season  and this one should be no different  by baseball prospectus s calculation  the dodger had   player with at least two win above replacement for them last season  no other team had more than   such player  and the average team had seven  <BRK> that depth allows manager dave robert to aggressively exploit matchup advantage on offense  and to use his starting pitcher with extreme caution  the dodger are the only team that ha not used a pitcher for   inning in any of the last three season  <BRK> they will be tempted this season to unleash walker buehler  who sparkled last fall in a one game playoff with colorado for the national league west title  in game   of the national league championship series clincher in milwaukee  and in the dodger  only victory in the world series  when he shut out the red sox for seven inning  <BRK> buehler     is not the only young homegrown starter who could make a major impact this season  the left hander julio uria     showed in october that he wa past the shoulder trouble that cost him nearly two season  <BRK>  there s really no pitch limit for walker  but we re going to see how his body s reacting  how he feel and have that open line of communication   robert said   with julio  it s been abbreviated for him the last couple of year  so to say he ha a clear runway i don t think is fair to him  but i do know that he s going to impact u this year   <BRK> buehler and the veteran clayton kershaw have taken it slowly in spring training  but with the dodger  it is hard to tell the difference between hurt and injured  they play the long game in los angeles  where arriving at full strength in october is all that matter  <BRK> the dodger lost a few contributor from last year s team  but added center fielder a j  pollock  who wa a force for arizona when healthy  reliever joe kelly  whom they plan to use in an expanded setup role that could stretch him to   inning  and the grizzled catcher russell martin  who had a    on base percentage for toronto last year  martin s    batting average did not bother the dodger  friedman said  because he consistently made hard contact  <BRK> martin     ha played in five league championship series without ever advancing to the world series  this could be the year he get there   and  with any luck  he just might leap into the arm of closer kenley jansen after the final out  <BRK> then again  the colorado rockies are conceding nothing in pursuit of their first division title  they signed daniel murphy to play first base and gave third baseman nolan arenado an eight year     million contract extension last month  the entire team surprised arenado attending the news conference announcing the deal  <BRK>  i love playing with this group   said arenado  who fought back tear for a moment   i really believe we can win  i wouldn t make this decision if i didn t believe that   <BRK> the rockies  pitching carried them last season  setting club record for most strikeout  lowest whip  walk plus hit per inning pitched  and fewest hit allowed in a nonstrike season  kyle freeland and german marquez were rotation stalwart  and scott oberg and wade davis  who allowed one run in the regular season after aug     stabilized a bullpen that will count on a full season from seunghwan oh  to offset the loss of adam ottavino to the yankee  <BRK> while colorado kept it cornerstone  the arizona diamondback shed theirs  trading first baseman paul goldschmidt to st  louis  they have not done much to replace the production of goldschmidt and pollock  but with zack greinke  robbie ray  zack godley and luke weaver in the rotation  they expect to compete  <BRK>  we re trying to make a shift here   manager torey lovullo said   we re going to rely on the pitching and defense and we re going to make up for some offensive loss in other way   <BRK> reverse engineer the diamondback and you d get the san diego padre  who added a middle of the order slugger with infielder manny machado but have a painfully inexperienced rotation led joey lucchesi  <BRK> the padre will soon let loose a flood of prospect  so it is hard to predict how close they really are to contending  but starter chris paddack and shortstop fernando tati jr  offered tantalizing spring training glimpse of the kind of young  cheap talent that enabled the padre to afford a   year     million contract for machado  <BRK>  a l  preview  how hard will it be for the red sox to repeat  ask the astros  <BRK>  you need to have quality young player that are making major league minimum  or prearbitration salary  to enable you to go out and sign some bigger dollar player  especially in our market  where it s not unlimited fund   general manager a j  preller said   we feel that we ve built up the talent base to enable u to get into conversation for machado and some of the big name free agent   <BRK> speaking of machado  preller added   you see it in the energy here at the complex  it raise the level of competition for everybody   <BRK> will it raise the padre  place in the standing  they should at least move past the san francisco giant  who did not improve an offense that ranked  th of   team in run last season  ahead of only miami  this will be the final season for giant manager bruce bochy  who is   victory shy of     in his career  he will need a lot of luck to get there  <BRK> every n l  central team expects to contend  which make this the most intriguing division in the major  the milwaukee brewer won it last season   in a one game playoff over the chicago cub   before their joy ride ended in that game   loss to the dodger in the n l c s  they know they might have missed their best chance to bring the world series to miller park  <BRK>  it s so difficult to put yourself in that position ever again   outfielder ryan braun said   we could have a much better team  a much better regular season  but thing have to go right to get to a place where you have a game   to get to the world series   at home  with the pitcher we want on the mound  after we had just won game   and felt great about our chance  i m grateful for the opportunity  but it s not an easy thing to get over   <BRK> the brewer hope to get over it finding an ace or two from a group of rookie who pitched mostly in relief in october  corbin burnes  freddy peralta and brandon woodruff  they will again lean heavily on a strong bullpen and slugging lineup that includes the most valuable player award winner  christian yelich  and a new catcher  yasmani grandal  who hit   home run with an    on base plus slugging percentage for the dodger last season  <BRK> the dodger benched grandal for most of the postseason after he struggled on defense in game   of the n l c s  in milwaukee  that diminished grandal s value but gave the brewer an opportunity  a one year       million contract that could be a steal  <BRK>  look  guy go into defensive slump   general manager david stearns said   we focused on the entirety of what we think he can contribute to our team  and we think it s meaningful  he s a very good receiver  he s a good framer  he handle a pitching staff well  and he can control the running game   <BRK> the st  louis cardinal went     last season for manager mike shildt  who replaced the fired mike matheny in mid july  it wasn t quite enough to lift them to the playoff  but they should return this year after a three year absence   an interminable gap for their regal brand  <BRK>  it s a long time  i know   said john mozeliak  the president for baseball operation   we re very aware of it   <BRK> in goldschmidt  marcell ozuna and matt carpenter  the cardinal have three elite run producer to go with slick defender like center fielder harrison bader  second baseman kolten wong and catcher yadier molina  who is   and just won his ninth gold glove  jack flaherty could be a breakout rotation star  and jordan hick   who threw   pitch last season that hit   mile per hour or higher   will form an imposing relief duo with the newcomer andrew miller  <BRK> the chicago cub finally solved miller in game   of the   world series in cleveland  when they completed a comeback and won their first championship since    they have not returned to the world series  and last season s wild card flameout put the clubhouse on notice  theo epstein  the president for baseball operation  ha vowed  sweeping change  if he doe not see improvement  <BRK> manager joe maddon is working in the final year of his contract  surrounded new coach but a roster that still includes more than half of the player who appeared for the cub in the world series  the core deserves one more chance  and another title would be no surprise  but given the strength of the division  neither would third place  <BRK> the cincinnati red are the only team in the major with at least   loss in each of the last four season  that streak should end now  because the red can finally pair their solid offense with a respectable rotation  luis castillo  anthony desclafani  sonny gray  tanner roark and alex wood  if they were in the a l  central  the red might be the favorite  the n l  version is much different  <BRK>  i ll tell you right now  this is the best division in baseball   said red reliever jared hughes  who ha also played for pittsburgh and milwaukee   we re always incredibly competitive from top to bottom  the goal is to win the division  to win the world series  and the vibe coming in is that we re capable of doing that  but there s no complacency in the n l  central   <BRK> the pittsburgh pirate can also dream big because of five exceptional pitcher  starter jameson taillon  chris archer and trevor williams and reliever felipe vazquez  and keone kela  but their middling offense got few upgrade  and right fielder gregory polanco will spend at least the first month recovering from shoulder surgery  <BRK> across pennsylvania  the philadelphia phillies were the clear winner of the off season   a meaningless title  of course  but reason enough to consider them the east favorite  despite going     last september to spoil a promising season  <BRK>  we had a lot of hole to fill  that wa the conclusion   said john middleton  the phillies  managing partner   when you look at the rubble of the last six week of the    season  we weren t a player away from being a good team  we were a bunch of player away   <BRK> general manager matt klentak started acquiring shortstop jean segura from seattle a part of a deal for carlos santana  a materstroke that allowed rhys hoskins to move back to first bae from left field  where andrew mccutchen now play after signing a a free agent  klentak also signed reliever david robertson and traded for the game s best catcher  j t  realmuto  <BRK> it wa a good winter   and then the phillies signed bryce harper  the former national star  for   year and    million  <BRK>  to have him in this clubhouse is deflating for the team in our division  so it s a great feeling to be on this side   starter jake arrieta said   not that the team in our division are scared  any mean  i don t think that s the case  but we definitely appreciate the organization signing a guy like harper and bringing in the piece we have   <BRK> the washington national should still reach the playoff  with patrick corbin joining max scherzer and stephen strasburg in an overpowering rotation  their three best hitter   anthony rendon  juan soto and trea turner   have somehow never made an all star team  but that should change this summer  <BRK> the reigning division champion  the prospect rich atlanta brave  added third baeman josh donaldson and catcher brian mccann but otherwise stood pat  that may prove to be wise in time  but for now it leaf them looking vulnerable a pitcher mike foltynewicz  a j  minter and mike soroka start the seaon on the injured list  <BRK> injury also struck early for the mets  who tried to build a deeper roster this winter but will open without infielder jed lowrie  knee  and todd frazier  oblique   frazier is    lowrie is    and second baeman robinson cano is    but the under   hitter look good  and with jacob degrom atop the rotation and edwin diaz a the closer  the mets have a chance  <BRK>  i truly believe that we can and will win   said brodie van wagenen  the new general manager  he ha to say that  of course  and his move have been encouraging   but probably not enough  given the persistent injury risk on the roster  to change the mets  spot in the standing  <BRK> the miami marlin will be picked for last place in every reasonable forecast  the chief executive  derek jeter  got his wish and had the team s mechanical  home run sculpture moved to the outside of marlin park  the display wa whimsical and fun  but it would not have been used much  anyway   no player on this threadbare roster hit more than   homer last season  <BRK> tyler kepner ha been national baseball writer since    he joined the time in   and covered the mets for two season  then covered the yankee from   to      tylerkepner  <BRK>  <BRK>
