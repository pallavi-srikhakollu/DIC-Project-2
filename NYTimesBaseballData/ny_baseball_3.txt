<BRK><BRK>by tyler kepner<BRK>port charlotte  fla    in a tangible sign of cooperation between the commissioner s office and a skeptical player  association  major league baseball and the union announced several rule change on thursday that will affect the trading deadline  the all star game  roster size and on field strategy <BRK>the rule   some of which will not be implemented until     demonstrate that  after another winter in which many veteran free agent lingered for month on a sluggish open market  the league and the player were willing to modify their current collective bargaining agreement even though it doe not expire until after the   season <BRK> it s just good to see both side are working together   said infielder matt duffy  the union representative for the tampa bay ray   it s good when you have cooperation on both side of an industry  i think that creates a healthy atmosphere for the industry and the game to thrive  <BRK>for the player  the change are largely a prelude to a more complicated renegotiation of the financial aspect of the c b a   which the side have agreed to discus  but they will result in immediate difference to the sport this season  including a single trading deadline on july   <BRK> read more  a baeball debate it rule  player suggest trying harder to win <BRK>that rule eliminates the archaic and somewhat confusing process of trade waiver  which for year had created a second summer trading period  player can still be placed and claimed on outright waiver after july    according to the new rule  but cannot be traded after that date <BRK>the league also overhauled the selection process for the all star game starter and added a      million pool of bonus money for the home run derby  including    million for the winner  that might not be enough to motivate highly paid star to take part  but for many young player     million would dwarf their annual salary <BRK> i just got engaged to be married   said pete alonso  a slugging mets prospect who would earn the      minimum if he make the team   so that would definitely pay for the wedding cost  <BRK>the all star starter  non pitcher  will be selected in two phae  a primary round and a designated  election day   in the first round  fan will vote for the starter at each position  a they have for many year  then  on a day in late june or early july  fan will vote again  choosing from the top three vote getters at each position in the initial round  or the top nine for outfielder  <BRK>player will receive bonus for finishing among the top vote getters at their position  and the bonus pool for player on the winning team will increae  if the all star game go to extra inning  each inning beyond the ninth will begin with a runner on second bae  with player allowed to re enter the game a pinch runner <BRK>other change for this season further commissioner rob manfred s goal of speeding up the pace of play  the average nine inning game took three hour last season  down five minute from   but still   minute longer than the average game in   <BRK>pace of play rule for   will not include a pitch clock but will include a reduction in mound visit  from six to five  and in the time between inning  while the change remains to be reviewed with the holder of broadcast right  those break would be reduced to two minute for all regular season game  from   minute   second for local telecast and     for national telecast <BRK>the more significant change will begin in    roster will increase one slot  to   player  through the end of august  in september  though  the maximum roster size will be reduced to    from   <BRK> september game are a little outrageous at time  especially when you get two team that are really competing for a postseason spot   duffy said   they want to give themselves the best chance to win a game  and if that mean bringing in five or six reliever in one inning  they ve got them down there  why not use them  i think you re going to see a little more realistic game in september  <BRK>he added   and the reality is  to have   percent of your season be decided in a certain way and then all of a sudden in the most important game  everything flip completely   that s a little weird  too  <BRK>team will have a limit  still to be determined  on the number of pitcher allowed on the active roster   and all pitcher will have to pitch to a minimum of three batter  or to the end of a half inning  yankee reliever zack britton said player were conflicted on that rule  which m l b  will impose on it own with the union agreeing to not challenge it <BRK> it change strategy  for sure   britton said   i think nowadays there s not a many specialized pitcher that are just righty or just lefty  but obviously  if there are guy out there  it limit their role and job opportunity  <BRK>then again  britton said  the addition of a  th roster spot effectively creates another job for the union <BRK> adding one guy to the roster the whole year add a bunch of player that are going to get to arbitration sooner or hit free agency sooner   britton said   it allows you to give some of your player some day off  especially adding a position player or bench guy  <BRK>many people in baseball had assumed the  th man would be part of the last collective bargaining agreement  which went into effect before the   season  for the kansa city royal  a team that relies more on speed than other team  the extra spot would make it easier to put a pinch runner on the roster <BRK> for example  we re going to carry terrance gore to start the seaon  for sure   general manager dayton moore said lat week  referring to a player with one career hit but   stolen bae  including the postseaon   although terrance ha made a lot of stride a somebody who could potentially be utilized a an extra outfielder  you d feel a lot better about that if there wa a  th man  <BRK>the change for   also include restriction on position player pitching  limiting those appearance to extra inning or game in which the pitcher s team trail  or lead  at leat six run  the injured list for pitcher will also be returned to   day  from    a it ha been for all player since   <BRK>kevin armstrong contributed reporting from port st  lucie  fla   and james wagner from tampa  fla <BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK>
