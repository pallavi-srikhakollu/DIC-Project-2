<BRK>photograph jae c  hong associated press<BRK>by victor mather<BRK>in this era of new and complex baseball statistic  a venerable one still pop up frequently in conversation among even the geekiest of stat head  batting average <BRK>it s one of the easiest to understand     is good      is the mendoza line   you don t want to drop below that  if you want to praise a player  you re likely to get more mileage with most fan saying   he s hitting     than citing his war or babip <BRK>but a even some statistical neanderthal know  batting average is a seriously flawed meaure of offensive performance  it is great for evaluating a player s ability to hit single  but batter get no credit for their power  speed or batting eye <BRK>what if there were a statistic a eay to understand a batting average that accounted for the thing that batting average doe not <BRK>well  there is  it s called secondary average  and it wa invented the influential statistician bill james in the  s  unlike many of james s innovation  it ha not caught on heavily with fan   you can t find it in most stats website or on the back of baseball card <BRK>but secondary average is a useful tool to quickly evaluate a player s offense  identifying player who are underrated or overrated batting average <BRK>secondary average look and work a lot like batting average doe  but rather than focusing on hit total  it add up the batter s other offensive skill   extra base  walk and stolen base   and then divide at bat   some formula for secondary average also include hit by pitch  and others reduce the total for being caught stealing  we re using the simplest formula here  <BRK>let s use dee gordon of the seattle mariner a an example  he had a    batting average lat seaon    point higher than the league average       but his secondary average wa a mere    because he had very few extra bae hit and even fewer walk <BRK>here s how it work <BRK>dee gordon<BRK>seattle mariner<BRK>hit<BRK>at

to understand secondary average  it look and work a lot like batting average     is good  and    is not  major leaguers collectively had a    batting average last season  and their overall secondary average wa    <BRK>one difference is that the spectrum is much wider  while almost every player fall into the   s or   s in batting average  there are plenty of regular major leaguers with secondary average in the   s  and others over    or even    <BRK>here are the player who had the largest increase from their traditional batting average to their secondary average last season <BRK>of the player who qualified for the batting title last season  the leader in secondary average wa mike trout of the los angeles angel  with an eye opening     trout had a solid    batting average  but that hardly summed up his offense  he had a healthy number of extra base hit  including   home run  led the league in walk with    and stole   base  jose ramirez of cleveland       and mookie betts of boston      were just behind him at the top of the secondary average list <BRK>some historical context make trout s season look even more impressive  babe ruth s career secondary average wa     barry bond s wa    <BRK>at the other end  it reveals how some player  like gordon  bring little beyond an ability to hit single <BRK>the chicago white sox  jon jay  who spent last season with kansa city and arizona  had only three home run  drew only   walk and stole four base  these rather anemic extra contribution led to a sad    secondary average   compared with a    batting average   one point behind gordon  miguel rojas of miami wa at    <BRK>unsurprisingly  bryce harper s    batting average from lat seaon sell his contribution short  he hit   home run and led the major with   walk  for a secondary average of     mention that the next time someone dismisses him a  just a    hitter  <BRK>a le heralded example is joey gallo of texa  his    batting average might make it seem a if he is ready for a demotion to clas aaa nahville  but his   home run  and his double     and walk     gave him a robust secondary average of     keeping his slot in the ranger  outfield secure <BRK>while the phillies landed one high secondary average player in harper this off season  the rest of their winter haul didn t necessarily follow that trend  philadelphia also traded with the mariner for jean segura  whose    batting average seemed to plant him among the game s best shortstop  but secondary average reveals it to be something of an empty     although segura hit   double and   home run  his walk total wa a shaky    that add up to a secondary average of    <BRK>mario mendoza  career batting average     career secondary average     might approve <BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK>
