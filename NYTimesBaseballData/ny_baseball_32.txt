<BRK><BRK>the division and the pennant<BRK>the mets are in  the cub  and durocher  are done  and  believe it or not  the postseason awaits <BRK>by the new york time<BRK>following is an excerpt from a time article on sept       <BRK>by leonard koppett<BRK>with a flourish worthy of the occasion  the new york mets officially won their first championship last night beating the st  louis cardinal       in the presence of     paying spectator fully prepared for the ecstasy of the victory <BRK>by scoring their  th triumph of the baseball season  the mets clinched first place in the eastern division of the national league  a   year old circuit playing in two six team division for the first time  in their previous seven season  the mets had never finished higher than ninth in a   team league <BRK>five run in the first inning  three on a home run donn clendenon and two on a home run ed charles  set the victory mood early <BRK>gary gentry  a rookie  proceeded to pitch a four hit shutout and clendenon added another home run in the fifth  that gave the crowd nearly two hour to work itself up for the celebration that erupted at     p m   when joe torre bounced into a double play that ended the game <BRK>a the player raced for the clubhouse for their own celebration  thousand of spectator leaped railing and quickly filled the field  roaring and chanting  we re no      for the next   minute at leat  the cheering and milling continued  until the light were dimmed and a slow dispersal began <BRK>all concerned were fully and joyfully aware of what the victory meant  the chicago cub  who had led the division and the mets   game in mid august  had won their afternoon game  precluding the possibility that the mets would clinch before taking the field <BRK>but to perform the clincher at home  before the fan who have been such an integral part of the club s peculiar history  the mets had to win this game  the last scheduled for shea stadium  three game remain to be played in philadelphia this weekend and two in chicago next week <BRK>the style with which the mets won wa not restricted to the sudden  staggering attack with which they greeted steve carlton  the cardinal left hander who had set a major league record striking out   mets only   day ago in st  louis <BRK>the mets had won that game  despite the strikeout  but last friday they lost a doubleheader to pittsburgh and on saturday were held hitless bob moose of the pirate  if the cub  trailing four game at that point  had a chance for a final counterattack  that wa it <BRK>instead  the mets beat pittsburgh twice on sunday and last night completed a three game sweep of the cardinal  the national league champion for the last two year <BRK>this five game winning streak gave them a record of   victory in   game since aug     and   in their last   game  this constituted a stretch drive equal in quality to any produced baseball s most famous champion of the past <BRK>this time  carlton struck out only one man  cleon jones   and it wa the only man he retired  gentry  who had also started against carlton in the game in st  louis  quickly retired the cardinal in order in the first  and the crowd started chanting and clapping a the first met  bud harrelson  went to bat <BRK>harrelson looped a single to right field and the cheer increased  tommie agee walked and the noise increased again  it merged into a standing ovation for jones  who wa starting a game for the first time since sept     after sitting out most of the month because of hand and rib injury  jones  who still lead the league in hitting  wa determined to be part of this occasion and the fan recognized his desire and his season long contribution <BRK>but jones struck out  delaying poetic justice only momentarily  the very next pitch wa drilled clendenon over the center field wall   foot from home plate <BRK>this home run wa clendenon s  th of the seaon  his  th a a met  and it put gentry in control of the game <BRK>the mets weren t through  however  ron swoboda  whose two two run homer had beaten carlton in the game in st  louis  walked  and charles  who is   and near the end of his career  drove his third home run of the year over the   foot sign just to the right of dead center   a blow  he said later  he would always remember <BRK>dave giusti replaced carlton at that point  and although jerry grote greeted him with a double  there wa little offensive activity the rest of this brisk game <BRK>gentry  after three perfect inning  yielded a single to lou brock in the fourth  and one to mike shannon in the fifth  meanwhile  the mets started making sensational fielding play   harrelson at short  al wei at second  agee near the fence in left center <BRK>eventually  everyone wa just waiting for the formal ending <BRK>when the ninth inning began  the crowd began cheering every pitch  but brock beat out a single after harrelson made a fine stop behind second  and vic davalillo bounced a single out of harrelson s reach to center  still  the crowd roared encouragement to gentry <BRK>vada pinson struck out  bringing up joe torre   the brooklynite who established his slugging reputation with the brave  and who  might have brought the mets the pennant  if they had been willing to trade for him last winter  instead  he wa traded to the cardinal <BRK>at any rate  with torre at bat  the crowd wa chanting for a double play  and that s just what it got  torre bounced to harrelson  near second  who threw to wei  who threw to clendenon  and pandemonium wa officially in session <BRK>with their bat  and a broom  the mets capture the pennant <BRK>following is an excerpt from a article on oct       <BRK>by george vecsey<BRK>rico carty hit a long foul ball to left field  then he heard a noise  the manager of the mets wa coming out to remove the starting pitcher  the new pitcher wa named   <BRK> i didn t even know his name   the cleanup hitter of the atlanta brave said later   i never saw him before  it didn t make too much of a difference to me  a lot of pitcher i don t know  <BRK>the new pitcher   nolan ryan   went into the game in the third inning with two men on  and while ryan wa warming up  carty visited the dugout   i asked the guy what he threw   carty said later   some said fastball  some said slider  <BRK>there wa a reason carty had never seen the young right hander with no    on his back  ryan never pitched against the brave this season because of military duty and injury  and last year carty wa in a hospital recovering from tuberculosis  so he stepped up to home plate for his first look at ryan <BRK>the next thing carty knew  ryan had busted a fastball past him  the talk about ryan s slider wa merely a rumor <BRK>ryan finished the game and won the pennant for the mets  afterward the brave sat in the clubhouse and talked about fastball  not slider <BRK> heck  we knew what he threw   said henry aaron  who had a homer and double off gentry but two pop ups off ryan   i ve seen him in the past where he wa erratic  he s nothing but a kid but he did a helluva job out there  <BRK> he s a fat a anybody in the major   said manager luman harris   that s the first time we ve seen him all year  i wish we hadn t seen him today  <BRK>the brave seemed calm   or stunned   after their third straight loss  <BRK> they re destiny   said pat jarvis  the losing pitcher <BRK> they won the pennant   harris said   but i just don t believe they can hit our pitching like they did  i admire gil hodges  to me  there s no question he s the manager of the year  but i still believe if we played  em three more game  we d beat  em three straight  <BRK><BRK>
