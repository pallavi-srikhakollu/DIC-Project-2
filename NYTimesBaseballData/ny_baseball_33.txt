a week later  the mets took two out of three at wrigley field  the mets were now in second place  just four game out of first  <BRK> at which point  the mets flattened out  on july    manager gil hodges even went out to left field to pull cleon jones from the game  jones  he felt  wa not hustling  <BRK> hodges wa sending a message  but the mets kept struggling  by mid august  they were   game out  <BRK> and then  with woodstock being staged in the background  the mets took off  they swept the padre at shea in two weekend doubleheader and began a run in which they would win   of their last   game of the season  sometimes in stupefying fashion  <BRK> there wa  for instance  the delirious aug    game in san francisco in which the mets threw out runner at home in the eighth and ninth inning along with another runner at third and then won in the  th on a home run  <BRK> a week later  manager leo durocher and his swooning cub arrived at shea  and the mets beat them twice  with fan sarcastically serenading durocher and with a black cat running in front of the chicago dugout  the next day  the mets moved into first  two day later  they won a          doubleheader in pittsburgh  the starting pitcher drove in both run  <BRK> three day later  the mets struck out a record   time against steve carlton in st  louis  but so what  they won  anyway  with ron swoboda hitting two two run homer  <BRK> the mets were now pulling away with   game to go  the impossible had become the inevitable  <BRK> following are excerpt from new york time article in    <BRK> shea stadium  june   <BRK> scaling new height again  the new york mets climbed past the break even point and into second place in the national league east beating the los angeles dodger       at shea stadium tonight  <BRK> two home run ed kranepool  a well placed misplay the dodger  tom seaver s eighth pitching victory and tug mcgraw s second save marked the historic occasion  which also stretched the current winning streak to six game  <BRK> no met team had ever been above    beyond the fourth game of a season  in    and again this year  the mets won two of their first three game  but in    they lost the next five and this year they lost the next four  never again did they have more victory than defeat until now  when their record stand at      leonard koppett <BRK> july   <BRK> it ha taken them  Â½ year    victory and   defeat  but today the mets finally begin an important series  <BRK> at     p m  at shea stadium  they start a three game series with the chicago cub  the only team ahead of them in the national league s eastern division  <BRK> the bumbling player who opened at the polo ground in   and their masochistic fan would be dizzied the mets  five game proximity to first place  and the new yorkers have lost only three more game than the cub  the most important measurement between two winning club  <BRK> whether sold out or close to it  shea should be rocking every minute of the series  the cub have lost three straight  the mets have won five straight and gil hodges of the mets and leo durocher of the cub have set up their best pitcher for the series  george vecsey <BRK> shea stadium  july   <BRK> tom seaver of the mets thrilled the biggest baseball crowd in shea stadium history tonight coming within two out of pitching a perfect game  <BRK> jim qualls  a rookie outfielder of the chicago cub  drilled a solid single in the ninth that disappointed seaver and the     fan who were quivering with every pitch  <BRK> seaver finished with a one hitter and a     victory that narrowed the cub  division lead over the mets to three game  <BRK> the mets have won seven straight and the cub have lost five straight  and after the near perfect game  who know where these opposite kind of momentum might lead  <BRK> the mets were loose and confident going into the game because their best pitcher wa going to work  the   year old  right handed seaver  a fine athlete  had won   game and lost    <BRK> but two hour later  the mets and their fan wanted much more than victory no     they wanted perfection and the first no hitter a met  and they cheered madly for every cub out  <BRK> the first batter in the ninth wa randy hundley  the experienced catcher  he tried to bunt a high pitch  but the ball rolled to seaver s right and seaver threw hundley out at first  the fan  ever sensitive  booed hundley for having tried to bunt seaver out of a perfect game  <BRK> the   year old qualls  a switch hitter batting left handed in his  th major league game  wa the next batter  seaver wanted to keep the ball outside to him  but the pitch strayed a little too close to the plate and qualls stroked it solidly to left center  nowhere near cleon jones or tommie agee  george vecsey <BRK> july   <BRK> the moon didn t figure in the conversation   mostly in spanish   at the full moon bar and grill at  st and broadway  the bar wa recently renamed la luna llena  <BRK> it s owner  richard hauseman  wa asked why the customer weren t following the moon shot on television   what s there   he retorted   walter cronkite talking   that s all   <BRK> the television set were on at most other bar  but not for walter cronkite or the astronaut  in chicago  the mets were ahead of the cub  suggesting a miracle that even jules verne did not foresee  a bartender wa asked whether his customer were more interested in the mets or the astronaut  <BRK>  the mets  of course   he said   aren t you   joseph lelyveld <BRK> aug    <BRK> the mets have seen the moment of their greatness flicker  pressing chicago for the eastern division lead before falling back  the fan overreacted  talking world series  and the national press and broadcasting  who used to come to shea stadium to interview the other team of the national league  trumpeted the emergence of a great new power  then the mets lost seven of    their first bona fide slump  they also suffered some of the emotional problem of sudden glory  <BRK> last wednesday afternoon  hodges pointedly removed cleon jones  his best player  from the outfield in the midst of a game  apparently for playing a ball too casually  and then ron swoboda  the mets  best off season banquet player  publicly chided the tra la la attitude of the club  the lack of intensity  robert lipsyte <BRK> san diego  aug    <BRK> jerry koosman pitched the new york mets to within two game of first place tonight a he overpowered the san diego padre       with a two hitter for the mets  sixth straight victory  <BRK> he allowed the two hit in the first inning but no more the rest of the game and he faced only   batter   four more than the minimum  <BRK> the mets continued past another milestone on their remarkable road several hour after the first place chicago cub had lost again to the cincinnati red  and the time the mets had finished their work tonight  they were all even with chicago in game lost  and the cub  lead in the eastern division rested solely on the fact that they had played   and won   four more time  <BRK> the victory wa koosman s third in a row  and the mets   th in their last   decision  while the cub were dropping eight of    it also wa no    for the mets this season  one more than the record total they achieved all of last season  and it wa their  th in a row over san diego  <BRK> the situation at the top of the eastern division wa growing so sticky that ernie bank even telephoned long distance to san diego tonight  joseph durso <BRK> san francisco  aug    <BRK> the new york mets survived three hour of thrill   and sometimes terror   and defeated the san francisco giant       on a  th inning home run donn clendenon  <BRK> the victory ended the giant  winning streak at nine game and kept the mets       game behind the first place chicago cub  who beat the atlanta brave       <BRK> clendenon put the finishing touch to the mets  afternoon hitting a     pitch from gaylord perry over the right field fence with two out  but he did it only after the mets lived through two wild inning in the eighth and ninth  during which the giant put five runner on base   and the mets threw two of them out at home plate and one at third base  joseph durso <BRK> shea stadium  sept    <BRK> the new york mets   the urchin of baseball for the last seven year   shook down the thunder from the sky tonight when they overpowered the chicago cub       before     person in shea stadium  <BRK> it wa the fourth straight victory for the mets and the sixth straight defeat for the cub  and the urchin moved to within a half game of first place in the national league east with three week to go  <BRK> the mets  who have never finished higher than ninth  made the tumultuous scene last night on the five hit pitching of their prodigy  tom seaver  the   year old californian allowed four single  one double and one walk  and achieved his  st victory in the gaudiest season of pitching in mets history  <BRK> he wa never behind and rarely wa in trouble  and the crowd   which included     paying customer   spent much of the game on it foot  waving handkerchief and serenading manager leo durocher of chicago with stanza of  goodbye  eo   <BRK> leo might have felt like going  too  joseph durso <BRK> shea stadium  sept    <BRK> stop the season  <BRK> the new york mets reached and held first place tonight sweeping a doubleheader from the montreal expo      in   inning  and      and it is rank disregard for poetic justice to make them risk this precious attainment through the   game that still remain on the schedule  <BRK> nevertheless  the ultimate height ha been scaled  after seven humiliating year only partially soothed laughter  and never again can it be said that the mets have never been on top   we re no     we re no     chanted the     in shea stadium tonight  and that moment can never be taken away from them or from met supporter everywhere  <BRK> the moment  actually  wa     p m   eastern
