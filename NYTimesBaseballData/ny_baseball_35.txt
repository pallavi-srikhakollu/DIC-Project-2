<BRK><BRK> the personality<BRK>many people  and a cat  played a part in the mets  road to a championship <BRK>by jay schreiber<BRK>he wore the uniform of the brooklyn dodger  the new york giant  the yankee and the mets  although he wa often depicted a engaging in  stengelese   robert lipsyte  who covered the early mets for the time  said that wa nonsense   his hourslong monologue made perfect sense   he wrote  and if you listened  you would hear the always quotable  always clever stengel advise young player to  get in shape now  you can drink during the seaon   and proclaim after another loss that  the attendance got robbed   in every way  lipsyte said  stengel wa the mets  leading man <BRK>his real name wa marvin eugene throneberry  which meant his initial spelled met  originally a yankee  he joined the mets in may   and  in the spirit of thing  immediately started tripping over himself  his crowning moment came in a game in june when  playing first base  he wa called for interference in the top of the first and then  in the bottom of the inning  failed to touch first and second base after hitting a triple  when a teammate  charlie neal  followed with a home run  stengel came out of the dugout and pointed at each base for neal s benefit <BRK>long before he won the pulitzer prize for his newspaper column  breslin wrote a slim  engaging account of the   mets   can t anybody here play this game   from breslin s gleefully subversive point of view  the mets were nothing le than great comedy  a good a bert lahr in  the wizard of oz  or the marx brother in  room service    take any day  any town  any inning   breslin wrote of the seaon   with the mets  nothing changed  only the page on the calendar  it wa all one wonderful mistake   before long  breslin s book became aword for the mets  they had  with his help  become even more amusing <BRK> the mets is coming   declared one of the banner that mets fan brought to the bronx   although not into the stadium   on the night of june       for the first mayor s trophy game  it wa a matchup of the worst team in baeball and the mighty yankee  the banner may not have made it inside yankee stadium but ten of thousand of mets fan did  amazingly  the mets won       although  to be fair  the yankee had played a regular seaon game earlier that day  still  a robert lipsyte wrote in the time afterward   a frightened man told his foreman to shut up  a beaten dog bit a cruel mater  the long shot came home and beautiful  blue eyed tomorrow finally arrived  <BRK>she wa a wealthy society matron who wa at home at the racetrack and at the ballpark  and in   she became the first owner of the mets  she had been a minority stockholder in the new york giant  and had even tried to block their move to san francisco  that didn t work  but then along came the mets  a team whose game she would sometimes follow at the track with a transistor radio stuck to her ear  despite all her money  she wa  said the writer frank sullivan   a simple  generous woman with no swank   and all her considerable patience wa ultimately rewarded with a championship <BRK>the mets had begun their existence with a lot of player who were near the end of their career  so it wa hardly surprising that snider  a brooklyn hero who had gone to los angeles with the rest of the dodger  wa back in   a a met  in brooklyn  he had been a graceful center fielder  famous for sharing that position in new york with willie may and mickey mantle  in    at age    he usually played right field or left  and a a met  he hit   homer  batted    and then went to san francisco for the   seaon  where he ended his career amid a lot le losing <BRK>the original bedsheet banner that popped up at the polo ground in   and   essentially came out of nowhere  there wa no internet to organize the effort  no publicity campaign the mets to get thing going  instead  there were just banner  some of them pretty clever  but soon enough  the mets tried to put a more respectable gloss on the phenomenon creating an annual banner day  and for year at shea stadium  it proved to be a popular event  even if the banner tended to be a little more cute  see above     and a little le irreverent than the original <BRK> a a yankee  he won   championship and three most valuable player award before retiring in    a year later  the yankee fired him after just one seaon a their manager  and the following may  berra  about to turn    wa back in uniform  for the mets  but a a catcher and pinch hitter  the berra experiment did not lat long  four game  including two behind the plate  nine at bat  two single  at that point  berra proclaimed himself  an old man  and retired again  but   would bring him his  th championship  a the mets  first bae coach <BRK>he wa a fixture at first bae for the brooklyn dodger in the  s  and the ball landed in his glove for the lat out of the   world series  the only time those dodger won it all  he finished his playing career with the mets  in   and    and   he wa managing them  his powerful physical presence allowing him to convey a quiet  unbreakable authority  george vecsey  a longtime sport columnist for the new york time  said he came to think of hodges  a one of the most decent  straight  strong minded manager i ever met   it wa a strength that  made you listen   said tom seaver  and it would propel the mets in   <BRK>at    charles wa the elder statesman of the   mets  a team with many key player in their mid  s  the team s part time third baeman and sometime poet  charles grew up in the segregated south of the  s and   s and a a teenager he drew inspiration from spotting jackie robinson in spring training  he once even ran after a train on which robinson wa riding with his dodger teammate  charles hit only    in    but he started the winning rally in game   of the world series  and at the mets  victory parade  he read a poem he had written while stuck in the minor league <BRK>he joined the mets in june   in a trade with the montreal expo and represented the only significant pickup the mets would make during the season  he turned   a month later  making him the second oldest player on the team  like charles  a fellow african american  he became a veteran leader on a team that wa mostly white  tall and powerful  clendenon became part of the four platoon that manager gil hodges used daily  he played first base against left handed pitcher  ed kranepool played against righties  and it wa clendenon  who later earned a law degree  who became a huge factor in the world series <BRK>he wa born in    played for the same negro league team that jackie robinson did and in   became the first african american player on the chicago cub  in the year that followed  bank became one of the best and most popular player in the game  first a the cub  power hitting shortstop and later a the team s first baeman  he also became known a mr  cub  the optimist who endured one losing seaon after another and still hoped for better  and   seemed to be that seaon  the one that would get him to his first world series  it didn t happen <BRK>in    durocher wa the colorful  controversial manager of the brooklyn dodger and gil hodges wa his rookie first baseman  but july of that year  durocher had left brooklyn to become the manager of the giant  after that  it wa in the caldron of dodger v  giant that hodges and durocher sized each other up  in   they were squaring off again  durocher managing the cub  hodges running the mets  durocher still fiery and quotable  hodges just the opposite  but hodges got the last word when the mets beat out the cub <BRK>and what were the yankee up to in    what were they up to while the mets pulled off one of the great reversal of all time  the answer is nothing much  the yankee went      continuing a decline that came out of nowhere in    the manager wa ralph houk  in his second stint in that role  in his first  he had led the yankee to world series title in   and    but in    the yankee weren t winning  the best player on the team wa mel stottlemyre  who went      notable teammate included gene michael  joe pepitone  horace clarke and bobby murcer  all of them were overshadowed the event in queen <BRK>the cat showed up uninvited  strolling right into the middle of a crucial mets cub game at shea stadium on sept        more precisely  it chose the top of the fourth to make it appearance  walking behind cub third baseman ron santo  who wa in the on deck circle  and then parading past the cub  dugout  at the time  the cub were losing       and the mets had tom seaver on the mound  a black cat wa not what the cub needed  in the end  the cub did get a run that inning  but that wa it  the mets won       and moved to half a game behind the cub in the standing  the cat disappeared  it work done <BRK>he wa the mets  sign man  the guy with the degree in design art from pratt institute who  from his seat at shea stadium  would hold up preprinted placard throughout the game to comment on the action  he wa  in effect  picking up where all the fan  bedsheet banner left off  a banner hung from a railing and stayed there  but ehrhardt  with his bag of   by   inch placard his side  could go with the flow a the game proceeded  he said he liked to anticipate what might happen in a game studying beforehand  he began holding up his sign when shea opened  five year  and a lot of bad baeball later  he  too  made it to the postseaon <BRK>the mets confronted one future hall of famer after another on their way to the championship in    but not one wa better than atlanta s hank aaron  the brave  slugger and right fielder  and in the three game national league championship series against the mets  the   year old aaron wa superb  three home run and two double in   at bat  but all of his heroic at the plate couldn t bring the brave a single victory against a mets team that normally relied on pitching  but simply outhit atlanta in the n l c s  afterward  aaron called the mets  amazing   casey stengel had often called the mets that  too  but with a big wink  aaron wa serious <BRK>the ebullient left hander wa the busiest member of the mets  bullpen in    throwing  ⅓ inning while compiling a     record and a     e r a  while picking up   save  and yet he never got to pitch in the world series  when the mets used only six pitcher from start to finish  mcgraw did  however  appear in game   of the n l c s   throwing three scoreless inning to close out an     victory for the mets  and in the bottom of the ninth of that game  after the first two brave hitter reached base  mcgraw struck out hank aaron looking <BRK>photo credit  casey stengel  patrick burn the new york time  marv throneberry
