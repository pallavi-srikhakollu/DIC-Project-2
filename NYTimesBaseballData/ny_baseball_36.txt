 <BRK>  <BRK> the world series <BRK> with stunning catch and stealthy base running  they manage to clinch a world championship  <BRK> by the new york time <BRK> memorial stadium  baltimore   saturday  oct        <BRK> first pitch  bowie kuhn  baseball commissioner national anthem  joseph eubanks  opera singer <BRK> leonard koppett covered the world series for the new york time  following are excerpt from his article about the first four game  <BRK> baltimore  oct      the euphoric suspicion that the new york mets might never lose another game wa dispelled conclusively today a the baltimore oriole defeated them       in the opening game of the world series  <BRK> mike cuellar  the   year old left handed cuban  pitched a strong six hitter  striking out eight men  tom seaver  the most glamorous met  also gave up six hit  but one wa a leadoff home run don buford in the first inning and four more hit came with two out in the fourth  when the oriole scored their three other run  <BRK> so seaver  who left after five inning  suffered his first defeat since early august after   consecutive victory  and the mets  for the first time in three week  lost a game that counted  <BRK> the oriole  however  were not concerned with met statistic  having run away with the american league s eastern division title  by   game  and polished off minnesota in three straight in the championship series  they extended some streak of their own taking a     lead in the four of seven series  <BRK> the only other time a baltimore team had played in the series wa in    when the oriole swept the los angeles dodger  winning the last two game     score here in memorial stadium  <BRK> thus  when the mets finally scored on a sacrifice fly al wei in the seventh inning  the run ended a string of   consecutive scoreless inning posted baltimore pitcher in series competition  the oriole also stand at this moment a the only team that ha won every series game it ha played  <BRK> the mets could have had that distinction had they won today  but the only real threat they mounted against cuellar came too late because seaver did not approach the form that had brought him   victory during the regular national league season  <BRK> in his lat start  against atlanta in the opening game of the pennant playoff there  he wa also hit hard  but he emerged a the winning pitcher  this time  he didn t get away with it  <BRK> memorial stadium  baltimore   sunday  oct        <BRK> first pitch  clara merritt ruth  second wife of babe ruth national anthem  york suburban high school band <BRK> baltimore  oct      amid the sort of ninth inning melodrama that make baseball legend  the new york mets evened the world series at one game apiece today beating the baltimore oriole       <BRK> three straight single with two out  ed charles  jerry grote and al wei  gave the mets the go ahead run in the top half of the ninth inning  then jerry koosman  who had held baltimore hitless for six inning before yielding the tying run in the seventh  needed ron taylor s help to nail down the final out with the potential tying and winning run on base  <BRK> for the mets and their follower  the entire final inning wa a moment of truth  <BRK> if they lost this game  especially after koosman s fine two hit effort  their position would approach hopelessness  <BRK> dave mcnally had been tagged for a home run donn clendenon in the fourth  the oriole then made it      <BRK> now  with two out in the top of the ninth  charles  the   year old third baseman to whom this world series is an unexpected and immeasurable experience  bounced a single through the left side  his second hit in a row  <BRK> grote also singled on a hit and run play and charles reached third  then wei  the unappreciated infielder  lined mcnally s first pitch to left for a single  scoring charles  <BRK> now it wa up to koosman  who needed three more out  he retired don buford and paul blair but that brought up frank robinson  a feared a batter a baeball can provide  <BRK> robinson walked  so did huge boog powell  out of the dugout came manager gil hodges  out of the game came koosman  and out of the bullpen came taylor to face brook robinson  <BRK> on a full count  robinson then swung and hit a sharp grounder to charles  wide of third  charles started to run the few step to third base for a forceout  saw he didn t have a play  and threw to first  clendenon dug up the low throw and robinson wa out  <BRK> the series wa even at a game apiece  <BRK> shea stadium  queen   tuesday  oct        <BRK> first pitch  roy campanella  hall of fame catcher national anthem  steve lawrence  actor singer <BRK> the victory scene in the new york met dressing room  once a subject for joke or dream  is becoming routine pandemonium  the player are getting used to it and more polished in handling the invading army of interviewer  <BRK> however  tommie agee  the superhero of game   of the world series  wan t in the dressing room  he wa off in a special conference room  where superheroes are subjected to mass questioning  and later wa on television  he did come in for a while to stand on a table and answer more massed question and then went out again  an hour and a half after the game wa over he wa still in his uniform  finally seated before his locker in an emptying room  answering question again  <BRK> most dealt with the two great catch  the one that ended the fourth inning with two men racing for home plate and the one that ended the seventh with three base runner and the batter  paul blair  all intent on scoring  elrod hendricks had hit the first one   <BRK>  i wa shading him a little bit toward right field   said agee of hendricks  who bat left handed  hendricks hit a high drive toward the left center field fence  and agee and cleon jones convened on it   i saw the ball well because the sky wa cloudy  not bright  but i wan t sure i could reach it  i figure  if i can touch a ball i can hold it   <BRK> he held it  in the webbing between the thumb and body of the glove  with which he had reached across his body  <BRK>  i knew it would be tough because it wa away from my glove side   he said  <BRK> blair s ball  agee felt  wa le difficult  <BRK>  it s an eaier play because it wa on my glove side   he said   and i didn t have a far to go  but the wind kept taking it away and i had to dive   <BRK> most observer  however  voted for the second catch a more remarkable   among them  manager gil hodges  <BRK>  they were both great  but the second one wa the greatest   said hodges  who ha seen a lot of world series in the pat   year a a player or spectator  he wa pressed to issue a rating  <BRK>  i d have to say the second one wa no    of any world series catch i ve seen   he replied  <BRK> shea stadium  queen   wednesday  oct        <BRK> first pitch  casey stengel  hall of fame manager national anthem  gordon macrae  actor singer <BRK> following is an excerpt from an article published oct        <BRK> neither the umpire nor the baltimore oriole noted that the new york mets scored the winning run in game   of the world series on an illegal play  <BRK> the run scored because the throw oriole pitcher pete richert to first  on j  c  martin s bunt in the bottom of the  th  wa deflected martin s left wrist a few stride before he reached the base  the ball bounced away from second baseman dave johnson  who wa waiting for the throw  and only after that did pinch runner rod gaspar  who had gone from second to third  continue home with the run that ended the game  <BRK> but martin  running to first base  wa not in the lane that exists specifically to prevent this sort of interference with a throw  picture show that he ran on the left side of the foul line instead of the right side  where he is supposed to run when there is a possibility of a throw being made to first base from behind him  <BRK> there is a special marking for this lane  a white line  three foot to the foul side and parallel to the foul line  extending the last   foot of the distance between home plate and first base  <BRK> no umpire called this infraction  for which martin should have been declared out   and no baltimore player or coach protested the oversight  <BRK> if martin had been called out  the game would have continued with one out  gaspar on third  al wei on second and tommie agee coming to bat  with bud harrelson due to bat  <BRK> the   foot lane ha been the source of controversy in several american league game during the last two year  on   play out of a hundred  the lane doesn t matter  since it take effect only if there is a throw from behind the runner  which is what happened in game    <BRK> unlike photograph of some controversial play  picture of this play leave no room for ambiguity  martin had both foot on the wrong side of the foul line  the throw hit his left wrist  it could not have done that if he had been in the proper lane  <BRK> the home plate umpire in game   wa a national leaguer  shag crawford  but the play could also have been called the first base umpire  lou dimuro  of the american league  <BRK> a complete game from koosman and complete lunacy in new york a the mets dot the  i  in impossible  <BRK> shea stadium  queen   thursday  oct        <BRK> first pitch  joe dimaggio  hall of fame outfielder national anthem  pearl bailey  actress singer <BRK> this article wa originally published in the time on oct        <BRK> by leonard koppett <BRK>  we did it all   <BRK> ron swoboda said it  and in saying it  he said it all  the new york mets had their biggest  their longest  their noisiest  their sweetest and their third victory celebration in   day at shea stadium yesterday  <BRK> on wednesday night  sept     they clinched first place in the national league east  champagne splashed like bath water  and everyone got splashed it  <BRK> on monday afternoon  oct     they completed a three game sweep of atlanta in the first  championship series  to determine the national league pennant winner  the activity wa similar  but the intensity wa le  and the world series loomed ahead  <BRK> and now  on a mid october thursday a good two week before halloween  the mets had won the world series and this wa positively the last   and wildest   champagne shower  <BRK>  this is the summit   cried ed charles    year old and  until a couple of month ago  beyond hoping for this particular thrill   we re no    in the world and you just can t get any bigger than this   <BRK>  some people still might not believe in u   said cleon jones   but then  some people still think the world is flat   <BRK>  it boiled down to this   declared bud harrelson   when it had to be done  we did it and they didn t   <BRK> the tumult wa augmented the crowded condition of an otherwise ample dressing room  this time  the crush of interviewer  cameraman and others carrying various equipment wa a dense a the subway at peak rush hour  far denser than for the other two celebration  no one could move a full step in any direction without pushing someone else aide  <BRK> that wa the main dressing room  but the office of the manager  which is to the left of the entrance door  while the corridor leading into the rest of the clubhouse lead off to the right  wa an oasis of order  <BRK> manager gil hodges at first wa in the mob outside  the first one into the empty office wa gil jr   the c w  post college student  who hastily climbed out of his civilian clothes and into his met uniform for the sweaty hour to follow  <BRK> then came his mother  and the older two of his three sister  <BRK>  we re champion   cried out joan hodges  who ha lived through her husband s baseball triumph and setback with such fervor all these year   imagine  we did it   <BRK> a moment later  the head of the family entered  and joan hugged him and squealed  <BRK>  you know what we are  you know  champion  we re champion of the world   <BRK> hodges hugged her back  and his daughter  and they kissed him  and he grinned  and gil jr  put his arm around them from behind while the mets photographer snapped a family portrait  <BRK> and then the stream of interviewer began to trickle in  filling the office with body but not with any of the hysteria outside  hodges  a he ha always been  wa calm  speaking softly but distinctly  mopping his face  listening attentively  answering carefully  smiling quickly   working  in a way  harder than during the game  <BRK> mr  joan payson  the team s owner  arrived  too  <BRK>  oh my  oh my   she kept repeating   oh my   donald grant  the chairman of the board  wa there  and then johnny murphy  who actually ran the club a general manager  and georgie wei who had started it  and other member of the mets family  <BRK>  yes  it s the same and it s different   said hodges  trying to answer question about how this victory felt alongside other world series triumph he experienced with the dodger  in   and     a a player  and a a manager  it s different   it s hard to explain  in a way this mean more  i m so proud of them all   <BRK> did he think donn clendenon wa the most valuable player  worthy of the car given for that distinction  <BRK>  that s not my job   said gil   i think of all   of them   and four coach  let s see  that s     <BRK>  and the manager   someone suggested  <BRK>  no  no  not the manager   demurred hodges  <BRK>  the manager already ha a car   a voice interrupted  and everyone laughed  including hodges  <BRK> later it became celebrity time   pearl bailey  who kissed hodges  called him a  cool cat   and wound up dancing in the main room with charles while a record player blared the singalong record the met squad had made two week ago  robert merrill  the opera star  who sat with the met party all three day at shea and wa still shaking  bill shea  who set the whole thing in motion and for whom the stadium is named  saying  in my lifetime   they did it in my lifetime   <BRK> after an hour or more  joan hodges wa casting anxious glance at her husband   who  after all  had suffered a heart attack only   month before and whose marvelous discipline and recovery can t eliminate worry  only two day ago  however  a doctor s examination had shown gil in fine shape  <BRK> but sporadic yelling and singing were still going on in the clubhouse  the floor slippery  the room le crowded  but few player dressed  in another hour or two  they would go upstairs to the diamond club for a real party  with their wife and the whole met official family  <BRK>  it s the first one   swoboda had shouted at the beginning   and the sweetest  and because it s the first  nothing can ever be that sweet again   <BRK> in other word  all they have to look forward to is repetition  <BRK> the final out  the announcer curt gowdy on nbc   there s a fly ball out to left  waiting is jones   the mets are the world champion  jerry koosman is being mobbed  look at this scene   <BRK> in both year  the world series lated five game  but the similarity pretty much ended there  daytime game then  nighttime now  complete game then  an army of reliever now  and so on  however  each series did have a first baeman who excelled and did so with virtually the same statistic  what wa very different wa the vehicle they drove away with a the series m v p  <BRK>   <BRK>   <BRK>
