 <BRK>  <BRK> by jay schreiber <BRK> ask rod gaspar what moment he remembers most from the mets    season  and the backup outfielder with the powerful arm point to a head spinning game in san francisco at the end of august  and why not  it wa a game in which he and donn clendenon combined to throw out three giant runner at third base and home plate in the eighth and ninth inning before the mets won it in the  th  <BRK> or  a gapar put it   typical mets   <BRK> ask ron swoboda the same question and he graciously overlook his famous catch in the world series and instead cite a september game against the chicago cub  with first place on the line  <BRK> in the bottom of the first inning  the cub knocked down the mets  invaluable leadoff hitter  tommie agee  swoboda take it from there  <BRK>  in the top of the second  jerry koosman throw a rocket right at ron santo s coconut and he put an arm up  you want to play this game  i don t think so  he hit santo in the arm  koosman wa a warrior  he wa an assassin  they threw at agee  that s all koosman needed  <BRK>  after they knocked down agee  i remember tom seaver yelling in the dugout   you don t want to do that   koosman took care of the rest   <BRK> ask koosman who or what stand out most   year later and he is quick to cite gil hodges  the manager behind the mets  miracle  <BRK>  gil wa the man   there wa a lot of quiet management that went on   he said   gil talked a little bit in code  but you knew what he meant  you knew where he stood and what he expected of you  and it worked great  we won  didn t we  at   to   odds in vega before the season  and we end up winning   <BRK> ed kranepool  who played   season for the mets  remembers what it wa like to be a platoon player in the world series  in the five game it took for the mets to upend the favored baltimore oriole  kranepool and three other left handed hitter   art shamsky  ken boswell and wayne garrett   were in the starting lineup just once  for game    <BRK>  did the left handers want to play in the world series   he said   yeah  but you had to respect gil and what he wa doing  we did get to face jim palmer in game   and we knocked him out  the next day  we sat down again  so we sat there  but we were winning   <BRK> jim mcandrew  who wa in the back end of the   starting rotation  wa on the postseason roster and didn t get to play a single moment  but he almost did  <BRK>  i wa scared to death because seaver gave up that leadoff homer in the first inning of the world series  and hodges immediately had me up in the bullpen   he said  still  he didn t get into that game or any other in the series  <BRK>  but you can t gripe   he said  <BRK> mcandrew  gapar  swoboda  koosman and kranepool spoke to the new york time early this month in connection with the  th anniversary of one of the most remarkable moment in baeball history   the sudden acent of the mets to a championship after the team s previous life a a laughingstock  <BRK> the five spoke with pride of what they accomplished  but with some sadness  too  fifty year is a long time  and a half dozen player from that team have died  others have serious medical issue  <BRK> it is a somber scorecard that also includes hodges  who died of a heart attack before the   season  and the death of three of his four coach  and seaver     the best player on that   team  ha advancing dementia  <BRK> the disclosure of seaver s condition wa made shortly after the former mets had spoken with the time  but they were all aware that seaver had been struggling with the effect of lyme disease for year  more than anything  they were aware of how relentless time is  <BRK>  caey wa right when he said you get old very quick   said kranepool  referring to caey stengel  who wa the mets  manager when kranepool joined the team a a teenager  now kranepool is   and in need of a kidney transplant  although he remains intent on being part of the   reunion the mets will stage at citi field in june  <BRK>  it s frustrating   he said   you would like to see everybody  but it doesn t work that way  i don t think i m going to be around for the  th  so i m glad we re doing this   <BRK> swoboda  who is also    said   i don t know where the   year went  but we are a band of brother  very few of u were involved in anything else of that magnitude   <BRK>  it s no fun seeing our guy go down   said gaspar  who is     i hope we can have   of u at the reunion   <BRK> koosman said he planned to be there  he is    the oldest of the five  but still doing back and forth bantering with swoboda  except now it s via email instead of in the clubhouse  and what do they jab each other about  <BRK>  politics   said koosman  swoboda  he said  is too liberal   tell him to get a life   he said  joking   tell him to quit watching msnbc and reading the new york time  tell him to read the sport section and stop there   <BRK> told what koosman had said about him  swoboda laughed   i love the guy   he said   but he sends me all this stuff from the blogosphere    <BRK> mcandrew  amused all of this  wa willing to volunteer that he view himself a  socially compasionate  fiscally responsible   swoboda  he added   is a non backing off lefty   <BRK> a lefty who  in    played right field  and not always that well  hodges would take him out of game for defensive purpose and insert gaspar   which drove me crazy   swoboda said  <BRK>  i wanted to be good enough for hodges not to have to do that    he added   and eventually  i wa  eventually  he left me alone   <BRK> right through the top of the ninth inning of game   of the series  when swoboda s do or die catch of brook robinson s line drive kept the oriole from taking control of the game  <BRK>  clendenon   swoboda noted sardonically   called it the stupidest catch he ever saw because i went for it   <BRK> clendenon  alert  tough  college educated  a veteran voice in the clubhouse  and a central figure in that wild august game in san francisco that gaspar so vividly remembers  here s how he tell it  <BRK>  it s the bottom of the ninth  tie score  one out  bob burda is on first  willie mccovey is up and we have the mccovey shift on  everyone is pulled over to the right  i m playing left  but i m almost in center  tug mcgraw is pitching and mccovey stick out his bat and hit a high  nine iron shot down the left field line  i chase after the ball  pick it up and throw blindly toward home plate  <BRK>  i knew it wa the game right there  i figured burda wa going to score easy  but you know what  i threw a rocket to jerry grote  all the way in the air  and burda wa out   foot  and grote wa so stunned he rolled the ball back to the mound even though there only two out  and mccovey  who had reached second  see this and take off for third  and clendenon  who wa always paying attention  pick the ball up and throw to third  double play  <BRK>  the next inning  clendenon hit a home run and we win the game   <BRK> mcandrew said   clendenon could strap you on his back and get those big hit to drive in run for a week or   day  all the low scoring game  we won them   <BRK> and all the crazy game   the mets won them  too  some mystical combination of talent  toughness  luck and magic conquered everything in it path  for one season  <BRK>  the next year   swoboda said   we tried to make it happen  rather than let it happen  something wa missing  all it doe it add more mystery to   in my book   <BRK> a magical  mystical mystery  actually  one that    year later  still endures  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
