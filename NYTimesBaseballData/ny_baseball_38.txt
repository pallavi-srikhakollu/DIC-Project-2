<BRK><BRK>by george vecsey<BRK>with the vietnam war dragging on    wa not a good year for discussing the character building value of the military <BRK>from a distance of half a century  however  it seems rather clear   at least to me   that the loopy young mets franchise had it spine stiffened two men trained the united state marine <BRK>two of the steeliest people in the mets clubhouse were gil hodges  the manager  and tom seaver  the pitcher  later known a the franchise  both could turn downright taut   eye narrowing  jaw tightening  speech clipped   when reporter or broadcaters or fan or even mets ballplayer acted a if these were the same old mets <BRK>we reporter were the worst  i know i wa conditioned to believe that the mets were fun  but terminally hapless <BRK>wipe that smile off your face  mister  this is no laughing matter <BRK>hodges had seen combat on okinawa  while seaver wa a marine reservist  semper fi  they staked out territory and they did not give it up <BRK>hodges had been part of the mets in the first goofy day  in spring training    when casey stengel wa filibustering to catch the public s attention  hodges wa happy to be back from los angeles  in his wife s home borough of brooklyn  where he wa beloved for his grand decade plus with the dodger  his knee wa shot  and marvin eugene throneberry  check out the initial  became the regular first baseman and an immortal met blunderer <BRK>the mets were not adequate enough to benefit from hodges s boy of summer way of doing thing  he became the manager of the wahington senator for what some felt wa an apprenticeship for the mets  job  which he wa offered in   <BRK>seaver arrived from the farm system in    after growing up fast in the marine and later learning the game under rod dedeaux at the university of southern california  in some way  seaver wa a normal young man in his early  s   full of energy  a whooping laugh  prank on teammate  he could also do the new york time crossword puzzle and converse with writer  when he wa playing  he did not bring up his time in the marine corp reserve in      but later he talked proudly about it <BRK> i wa a mediocre student   seaver recalled on veteran day  nov        at a ceremony in manhattan honoring military veteran   if it didn t have a ball involved  i wan t much interested   but the marine sharpened his focus <BRK> the principle that i learned in boot camp were the principle that i took to the mound   he said   focus  dedication  i wouldn t have made it without the marine corp  <BRK>seaver mentioned a picture taken of him on the mound  locked into attention  during the playing of the national anthem   you look at my foot  they re in military position  absolutely   he said   that s the discipline that wa instilled in me  it s a very important reason why i m in cooperstown  <BRK>it is not clear how much seaver and hodges discussed their marine root with each other  they had served under vastly different circumstance   seaver stateside  hodges facing incoming kamikaze pilot in the pacific theater <BRK>hodges wa a college boy from southern indiana  noticeable because of his muscle  stengel  on one of his franchise building conversational ramble  once said that hodges wa so strong  he could squeeze your earbrows off   nobody knew what an earbrow wa  and nobody wanted to ask <BRK>i had a mentor in the newspaper business who had been a young columbia university dropout and baseball freak  sent to the island of okinawa  there were rumor that a large young marine on the island wa a major league ballplayer   the dodger had let hodges play one game at third base in   before he shipped out  <BRK>on okinawa  my friend heard rumor that hodges had been in hand to hand combat  but that rumor ha been deflated mort zachter  the author of  gil hodges  a hall of fame life   published in    hodges wa awarded a bronze star  with the citation mentioning his duty supporting his commanding officer  in a dangerous zone  but there is no mention of his being in direct combat  he surely saw death all around him <BRK>when hodges became a star with the dodger  he often went to the movie in his free time  a friend who accompanied him said hodges would grow solemn if there wa a scene of combat  and he would pray   amen   at every fallen military person <BRK>hodges carried his marine steel in the manager s uniform  when reporter made joke he smiled weakly and politely  but he did not encourage levity or cynicism <BRK>few player challenged hodges  except for the earnest and curious young outfielder ron swoboda  otherwise known a rocky  who had grown used to the garrulous oration of stengel <BRK> i would sit and listen to him   swoboda said of the old man in     it would sound a if he wa speaking in stengelese  but all of a sudden i d say   hey  man  this guy is telling a parable   and it s aimed at me   <BRK>by    casey wa three full season into retirement and gil hodges wa the manager   when you re young and full of yourself  you do thing you regret   swoboda said   gil sometimes made me feel he wa rubbing our nose in his authority  but that wa me  that wa my fault <BRK> i remember one time early in   he held a meeting and he said   you guy are professional  you set your own curfew   and somebody suggested two and a half hour after the game  and gil said it wa too long  and i popped up   gil  why don t you jut tell u   i would do my thing like that  why didn t i jut shut up  <BRK>one player who wa definitely in tune with hodges wa the third year pitcher tom seaver  on may       seaver beat the brave in atlanta to bring the mets to an     record   the latest in their first eight season that they had been even <BRK> tom  tom   babbled one of the regular reporter  not me  but it easily could have been    you re a    ball club  aren t you going to celebrate  <BRK>seaver  who could be garrulou when he wanted to be  gave u the hodges stare <BRK> what s so good about      seaver snapped   that s only mediocre  we didn t come into the season to play    ball  i m tired of the joke about the old mets  <BRK>and he wasn t done  seaver then invoked two fan and writer favorite from the first few year of the mets <BRK> let rod kanehl and marvelous marv laugh about the mets  we re out here to win  you know when we ll have champagne  when we win the pennant  <BRK>seaver and hodges seemed to have similar drill instructor in the marine  hodges wa changing the work habit of the team  backed up having talented young player at his command  nobody wa exempt from protocol  one day he trudged slowly out to left field and inquired about the health of cleon jones  his best hitter  who had pursued a ball a little too slowly for hodges s taste  the manager then escorted jones to the dugout  and fan and writer wondered if he might have lost jones  instead  jones played well down the stretch <BRK>those of u who were around in     the year of marvelou marv   never thought the mets  even with those young arm  could ever win anything  but they did win the pennant  and they did spray champagne <BRK>just before the world series  seaver wa aked about the national antiwar protest planned for oct     he wa quoted a aking   what is so unpatriotic about being against such a terrible war   he touched off some debate  and stopped commenting on the war  but he had made his point <BRK>the mets won the world series in five game  and they sprayed everybody all over again   seaver being one of the chief celebrant <BRK>in that stunning autumn  we did not think of seaver and hodges a ex marine  but now it seems that some of their discipline wa part of those amazing mets <BRK>george vecsey wrote about the mets in the  s for newsday and the new york time
