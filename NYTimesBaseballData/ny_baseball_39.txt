<BRK><BRK>by kevin armstrong<BRK>port st  lucie  fla    when mets manager mickey callaway considered the   body in his clubhouse at the start of spring training  he noted an improvement <BRK> we have way more depth than we ve ever had   he said <BRK>he mentioned his stockpile of four catcher who could work in the major league this season  at first base  he welcomed a four man competition among pete alonso  dominic smith  j  d  davis and todd frazier <BRK> we re excited that it s going to be kind of a battle royale for a bunch of position this year   he said <BRK>that battle ha become something of a war of attrition  within day of arriving in camp  jed lowrie  the utility infielder who signed a two year contract worth    million in the off season  wa flown back to new york to learn that he had a sprained knee capsule  frazier followed the same flight path to a doctor s office a few day later with a left oblique strain that required a cortisone shot  the setback forced callaway to start mixing and matching his grapefruit league lineup before march commenced <BRK> unforeseen thing are going to happen   he said   that s just the reality of baseball  <BRK>outfielder have not been immune to the rash of injury  jeff mcneil  slated to start in left field  wa scratched from the lineup two day after scraping his left wrist while diving for a batted ball during a game  center fielder brandon nimmo missed action because of an upset stomach after cooking chicken for himself <BRK> we re going to have to teach him how to cook so he doesn t miss any more game   callaway said <BRK>the unfortunate ha been familiar to the mets of late  last spring  outfielder tim tebow tripped on a sprinkler head during his first workout  over the summer  pitcher noah syndergaard received a diagnosis of hand  foot and mouth disease  in the fall  david wright retired because of chronic neck and shoulder ailment  all were reminder that the best plan can go sideways quickly <BRK>with opening day le than a month away  here is how the roster look <BRK>infielder  who s at first  it depends on the day  alonso led off the exhibition seaon with a solo home run in his first at bat  and davis  who can play first or third  countered blating a two run homer a he went   for   a a designated hitter <BRK>the mets are sure handed up the middle  with robinson cano bringing his nifty fielding and a smooth stroke to second base  shortstop amed rosario will be a running threat on the base  and adeiny hechavarria  a late pickup who previouly played with the yankee   cover u in so many way   callaway said <BRK>when healthy  lowrie  who ha primarily played at second base and shortstop but is expected to start at third for mets  will provide versatility  so will frazier  a veteran whose experience is valued in the clubhouse <BRK>outfielder  yoenis cespedes  who is recovering from operation on his heel  is in camp and singing along to country song in the clubhouse  but he will not be patrolling the outfield anytime soon  callaway considers cespedes  the icing on the cake  if he can come back for a late summer run <BRK>for now  center field belongs to nimmo  mcneil  who may need to be called into duty at third base  will be in left  and michael conforto will be in right <BRK>there are plenty of leg with juan lagares and keon broxton playing reserve role  but the mets also need hit  last season  only one team in the major had fewer hit than the mets   the philadelphia phillies  conforto and company will be counted on to put more ball in play <BRK>starting pitcher <BRK>according to callaway s calculation  the mets should plan to use   or   pitcher this season  jacob degrom  who won the cy young award with a     earned run average last season  and syndergaard  who posted a     e r a   will anchor the rotation  both have looked healthy in workout and game action<BRK>zack wheeler went     with a     e r a  down the stretch in the second half of last season  and jason vargas wa     with a     e r a  in his final eight start  steven matz will try to build off a season with   start  a career high <BRK>syndergaard started on opening day last season  he ended up with   strikeout in  â…“ inning  but missed start because of a strained ligament in his right index finger and the hand  foot and mouth disease <BRK>the only certainty is who will take the ball on opening day in washington <BRK> i think jacob decided that last june   callaway said <BRK>bullpen  cano headlined the seven player trade that brought him back to new york during the off season  but edwin diaz  the   year old closer who collected   save in   chance for seattle last year  may be the most important part of the transaction for the mets <BRK>jeurys familia  once the closer  return a the setup man  in six and a half seaons with the mets before he wa traded to oakland lat summer  he saved   game and his e r a  wa     <BRK>seth lugo can set up  close or start <BRK>catcher  wilson ramos ha been well received the pitching staff  he look fresh after spending the off season working on agility drill and convincing general manager brodie van wagenen that he can do the job despite twice tearing the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee <BRK>travis d arnaud is returning from tommy john surgery  and devin mesoraco is back behind the plate after catching   of degrom s start last season <BRK>though he can play other position  d arnaud will focus on catcher rather than risk injury during rehabilitation  he could be an option elsewhere  in the outfield or at first base  depending on how the team s depth hold up <BRK><BRK>
