<BRK><BRK>by george vecsey<BRK>this happened at shea stadium a few decade ago  my son and i were in a half empty section  not far from two older black men <BRK>one of the mets made a clodhopper move on the base  and wa tagged out <BRK>one of the two fan then turned to the other and said   jackie robinson wouldn t have done that   i chortled  and we struck up a conversation  having the burning image of jackie robinson very much in common <BRK>jackie robinson hovered over that game  and he ha hovered over every game that ha been played since april       when he made his major league debut <BRK>he upgraded the game  and he upgraded my brooklyn dodger  and he upgraded life in america in his   year in the major league and in his short but active career out in the real world  pushing for opportunity for black people in all business <BRK>he raised the consciousness of american  whether they wanted it or not  and that is good reason to honor him on the  th anniversary of his birth <BRK> on jackie robinson s  th birthday    photo of an icon <BRK> claire smith  jackie robinson showed me how to fight on  not fight back <BRK>he wa a hero in my family  i met him once  under the stand in ebbets field  in a hot dog line  during a game in   when he wan t playing  we asked him how his injury wa  and he answered a couple of teenager with politeness   i wa shocked to see his gray hair and thickening midsection  he seemed old before his time  the stress seemed to have aged him  <BRK>i also interviewed him once on the phone  around    when i wa doing a story on the absence of black coach and manager in baseball <BRK>when i called for the prearranged interview  he turned the theme around  asking how many black journalist were in the sport department where i worked  umm  none  i said  thereby touching off a monologue on lack of opportunity everywhere  that s what i m talking about  he said  i consider the lecture a highlight of my career <BRK>decade later  i told his widow  rachel robinson  about our testy interview <BRK> that sound like jack   she said  with her mona lisa smile <BRK>the world wa not paying attention when jack roosevelt robinson wa born on jan        in cairo  ga  back east we began learning about him in    when branch rickey signed him to a contract with the brooklyn organization <BRK>his presence in dodger camp in   wa a big deal in my family s home in queen county  just eat of the mother ship   that is to say  brooklyn  we were dodger fan and my parent were also  s lefty who adored franklin delano roosevelt and who regarded two other african american  marian anderson and paul robeson  a icon  both for their singing talent and for their dignity <BRK>not all dodger fan came from our sociopolitical point of view  of course  but jackie robinson wa on all dodger fan  mind a he trained with dubious white teammate in   and then succeeded at the top farm club in montreal that seaon <BRK>the next year  the phone rang in our house on april    my dad wa calling from his newspaper office and he had momentous news to relay  the dodger had signed jackie robinson to a major league contract and he would make his debut on opening day  five day later  i wa almost    i can remember the exhilaration <BRK>and if working class white folk like u were enthued  it wa even more personal for black folk  when there wa finally a ballplayer who looked like them <BRK>ed charles  the poet third baseman of the   mets  who died a year ago  often talked about being a youth in florida in the late  s  watching the touring dodger departing railroad after an exhibition  watching jackie robinson play card with his white teammate <BRK>the dodger won the pennant in    robinson s first seaon  and just a important  they gave brooklyn fan the lifelong certainty that our team wa the good guy <BRK>and what began for everyone in   wa a decade of jackie robinson on the field  running the base pigeon toed  a big man  a former tailback with adult weight on him  starting to take out infielder with a hard slide  starting to jaw at umpire  learning four new position to help the dodger  bringing his burning audacity to the major <BRK>for a while  he wore the shackle of docility  to which he had committed  but on the field he wa allowed to compete  fair and square  with bat  with glove  with foot  with head <BRK>black sport fan now had a new hero  excelling blatantly  in mixed company  that wa something to sing about <BRK>sure enough  in    buddy johnson  woodrow wilson johnson  for the record  wrote and recorded a song called  did you see jackie robinson hit that ball   it wa soon covered the great band of count basie <BRK>did you see jackie robinson hit that ball  did he hit it  yeah  and that ain t all  he stole home  yes  yes  jackie s real gone <BRK>because of robinson some american were lifted up from our stodginess and were able to appreciate a gifted athlete and a driven human being  excelling where no player of color had been allowed since the  th century <BRK>robinson s style even spread around baeball a black player proliferated  larry doby  roy campanella  don newcombe  monte irvin  and in   a wonder man named willie may  and then frank robinson and henry aaron and ernie bank and roberto clemente  all of whom made the national league the powerhouse for the next generation <BRK>perhaps  too  jackie robinson served a an example for a series of begats  james baldwin  nina simone  malcolm x  rosa park  martin luther king jr  muhammad ali  chuck berry  john lewis  dick gregory  harry belafonte  harry edward  jim brown  bob gibson  reggie jackson  bill russell  shirley chisholm  barack obama  michelle robinson obama <BRK>in    i asked rachel robinson what her husband would have thought of the obama candidacy <BRK> that is a political question  george   she said  smiling   and we don t talk about politics  <BRK>her husband had been overcome diabetes in retirement  and wa clearly failing during the   world series  when he wa introduced to joe morgan  the thoughtful young star of the cincinnati red  morgan wa thrilled  but also stunned  to see robinson  the man who danced off third base  now white haired and shaky and going blind  jackie robinson died a few week later  at the age of   <BRK>thirty five year later  morgan  a hall of fame member and broadcaster  wa at a celebration of the jackie robinson foundation   morgan call rachel robinson  the queen mother   <BRK>i stood with morgan and willie randolph  who grew up in brooklyn  a we watched old game film of a sleek  fleet tailback for u c l a  in   and    going wide  faking tackler onto the ground <BRK>did we see jackie robinson carry the ball <BRK>we exchanged high five at his audacity <BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK>
