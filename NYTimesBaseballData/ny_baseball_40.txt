 <BRK>  <BRK> by victor mather <BRK> here come the baseball season  which mean  in more and more of the united state  here come the baseball betting season  <BRK> in europe  where sport betting thrives  wagering on n f l  and n b a  game ha been fairly popular for year  but baseball  mostly unknown on the continent  ha not made a huge impact  with the american market opening up after a supreme court ruling that struck down a gambling ban  baseball betting could be ready to take it place alongside hot dog and apple pie  <BRK> so if sport betting is legal in your jurisdiction  peruse these odds and try to find a bet that will keep you in peanut and cracker jack  <BRK> sorry to bore you  but it s the boston red sox and the yankee again  the red sox won   regular seaon game and the world series lat year  losing only three postseaon game  they are   to   favorite to repeat  many bookmaker are putting the yankee up at the same odds  and some are hedging even further making the houston atros     a well  just behind are the world series runner up  the los angeles dodger  at     or so  <BRK> want to make the big buck  the baltimore oriole were     lat seaon  if you think that adding nate karns and jesus sucre will somehow allow them to emulate the miracle mets  you can get a price of a much a    or      <BRK> a couple of the race seem like lock  the astros are     to win the american league west  that mean you must put up    to win a buck   the dodger in the national league west and the indian in the a l  central are      not a lot of moneymaking opportunity there  the red sox and the yankee should finish     in some order in the a l  east  <BRK> but the two remaining race seem like barnburner  in the n l  east  the philadelphia phillies and their big acquisition  bryce harper  are favorite along with the washington national at      the atlanta brave  the defending division champion  are getting a little le respect this year at      and the mets  at      are far from out of the race  only the miami marlin       are given no hope  <BRK> in the n l  central  it s a three way race  with the chicago cub  the st  louis cardinal and the milwaukee brewer closely matched at     or slightly above  depending on where you bet  any one of them might be a slight favorite  <BRK> even if you don t like to wager  the odds can be revealing about which team have a good chance of surprising  or slumping  at least according to the prevailing wisdom  <BRK> it probably isn t too shocking to see the oriole and the marlin a long shot  but three team that had discouraging seaons lat year seem to be attracting some betting interest  the chicago white sox       and the cincinnati red       would seem to have a long way to go  but each is about     to win it division  a real puncher s chance  so are the san diego padre        but the reaon here is a lot clearer  the arrival of manny machado  <BRK> it s unlikely that all three of these team will turn it around this season  but the odds seem to be telling u that at least one will  <BRK> if betting on team isn t enough  most bookie are happy to take your action on the player a well  <BRK> the player expected to hit the most home run this year are the yankee slugger giancarlo stanton       and aaron judge        that leaf last year s home run king  khris davis of the athletics  at      <BRK> davis hit   homer last season  while stanton had   and judge    in   game   so the odds might well be testament to the legion of yankee fan eager to support their favorite  <BRK> mookie betts of the red sox and jose altuve of the astros are favorite in the hit category  while last year s leader  whit merrifield of the royal  is given little chance of a repeat       <BRK> the predicted run batted in champ is j d  martinez of the red sox at     after a season with a major league leading    <BRK> pitching win can be an unpredictable category  no one ha repeated a the major  leader since c c  sabathia in   and    and bettor have to weigh the quality of the pitcher and of his team  the odds reflect that  chris sale of the red sox is the favorite  but plenty of other ace   including max scherzer of the national  corey kluber of the indian and justin verlander of the atros   are given a good shot  <BRK> season long bet are all well and good  but they certainly take time to resolve  action hungry gambler will be heading for more traditional fare and betting on the opening day game  <BRK> the result of any single baseball game is unpredictable  of course  and many of the opening day contest seem like tossup  <BRK> well  except one  the yankee  playing at home behind masahiro tanaka  are  Â½   favorite over  yes  the hapless oriole  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
