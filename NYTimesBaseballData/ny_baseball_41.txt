<BRK><BRK>sport of the time<BRK>by michael powell<BRK>can we talk starting pitcher or  more to the point  their ritual sacrifice on the altar of major league baseball analytics <BRK>i put this question to leo mazzone  the former pitching coach for the atlanta brave and the custodian of one of baseball s greatest rotation of starting pitcher  greg maddux  john smoltz and tom glavine  hall of famers all <BRK>the   playoff and world series offered a parade of twitchy manager yanking their starting pitcher after four inning  summoning a parade of faceless reliever to throw one mind numbing fastball after another for fraction of an inning <BRK>this is spectacular for the radar gun industry  but is it watchable and good baseball <BRK>i heard mazzone snorting on the other end of the phone line  no  no and no   it is an embarrassment and insult the intelligence   he said   they are abusing pitcher and calling it smart  <BRK>mazzone imparted this gospel to his pitcher  trying to heave ball a fat a you can is for muscle beach dolt  a good pitcher throw at   to   percent of effort and make the pitch move and hit it location  varies speed  too  a for the notion a pitcher can lat but five or six inning before batter grow wise and clobber him <BRK>please <BRK> a high school coach asked me   leo what do you think of analytics showing that pitcher struggle the third time through a lineup   i ll tell you want that is  that s the manager covering his  you know what    he said <BRK>the equation guy who run most major league team bow to holy verity  no starting pitcher should throw more than   pitch  some starter should not throw a many a    to admire the number of win a pitcher accumulates or to encourage him to toss a complete game is to expose yourself a a paleolithic hunter gatherer  pitching is all about whip and fip  i d explain the definition  but then our head would hurt  and a conga line of relief pitcher <BRK>look  on a good day i don t drag my knuckle along the sidewalk of flatbush  brooklyn  i dig sabermetrics and back in the day treated bill james annual a religious text  i keep a three foot high stack of the analytics obsessed baeball prospectus at home  but at risk of registering a a get off my lawn crank  so much of the wisdom about pitcher is dubious <BRK>i set to thinking about this after watching my mets spend much of november and december in a modestly lunatic attempt to trade noah syndergaard  one of the national league s best starting pitcher  they appear to have failed at this self mutilation  now that they have retained two true ace   syndergaard and jacob degrom  the cy young award winner   why not stretch them out and push them to go deeper into game  what is the point in allowing an ace to pitch six inning before turning the ball over to a committee of anonymous reliever <BRK>game   of the   world series presented something of a nadir when los angeles dodger manager dave robert  a bright fellow no doubt  pulled his starting pitcher after he had yielded a single hit through six and a third inning and wa ahead       the dodger ended up marching six reliever into that game  lost       and exited the world series the next day <BRK>mazzone pulled out a few of his remaining hair <BRK> the greatest teacher for a pitcher is start   he say   pitch and pitch and pitch  let a pitcher find himself <BRK> the problem is that so many pitching coach and manager are yes men and don t want to challenge their front office  <BRK>there s a sizable mound of statistical evidence to back such assertion  at risk of giving the quadratic dude a seizure  i turned to baseball reference and selected   pitcher from the past half century  men who ran the gamut from solid to superb  these are the sort of pitcher you d expect to see in the postseason  and my list included bobby ojeda  mike torrez  steve avery  tom browning  tom seaver  steve carlton  ferguson jenkins and mazzone s troika of hall of famers  i examined their performance across game  from beginning to end <BRK>for most good pitcher  their worst inning wa the first  once they found a rhythm and once pitch began to crackle  they became progressively more difficult to hit  tom seaver s career earned run average in the first inning wa      his e r a  for the last three inning of a game  that dreaded third and fourth time through the batting order  stood at     <BRK>so current analytic wisdom doe a headstand <BRK> by way of insane outlier  seaver won   game in   and helped pitch the miracle mets to a world series championship  he pitched the ninth inning   time that season and surrendered not a single run  <BRK>this is a familiar pattern  mike mussina gave up fewer run on average in the seventh  eighth and ninth inning than he did in the first three  he wa at his best in the ninth inning  the best inning for ron darling and david well wa the eighth   requisite caveat  by definition  these pitcher were having a good outing if they made it to the late inning  <BRK>if you hoped to beat dodger pitcher fernando valenzuela  you were advised to start hacking early  he had a career e r a  of     in the first inning  when valenzuela wa still pitching in the ninth inning  and he got there roughly   time in his career  his e r a  wa     <BRK>luis tiant  the red sox and cleveland ace  wa nearly a tough  he pitched just over   time in the ninth inning and had an e r a  of     <BRK>greg maddux had a     e r a  in his first three inning and a     from the seventh inning through the ninth  and while he possessed a good fastball  it wa not a three digit express train  one spring training in the mid  s  maddux  who in a   year career piled up   fairly meaningful win  asked to speak with the team s young pitcher <BRK>mazzone nodded  sure thing  mad dog  whatever you want  the coach lined up the young guy and maddux walked over <BRK> you know why i am a millionaire  because i can put my fastball wherever i want to   maddux told them   do you know why i own beachfront property in l a   because i can change speed  o k   question  <BRK>mazzone wa not enraptured pitch count  he would not push pitcher to stupid extreme  but he refused to hew to limit without basis in medical fact  he had pitcher run and throw every day in between start  and they had remarkably few injury  in one three year stretch  his pitcher missed a single start <BRK> we kept track of pitch and i had a clicker   he said   but if tommy glavine get a pop up on a changeup  hell  i m not counting that  <BRK>he recalled a brave vice president the name of henry aaron who offered advice about the danger of radar gun intoxication   don t worry about pure speed   aaron said   you can run a jet airliner through the strike zone  and i will figure out how to rope it down the line  locate a ball that move at my knee  and i m out  <BRK>all of which brings me back to the mets  a team i ve followed for many  often hapless  decade  their manager  mickey callaway  sound a enamored of pitch count a his peer are  all of this seeps into the brainpan of young pitcher who labor under the impression that five or six inning constitute a day s work <BRK>syndergaard is a fine pitcher and susceptible to the idiocy of the age  a year ago he pumped iron in the off season in hope of throwing even harder than   mile per hour  and that season he blew a muscle in his side  he appears to accept the notion that pitching through the seventh inning lie beyond the limit of human exertion  and last season he posted a     e r a  in that inning <BRK>his rotation mate are no different  on the rare occasion they pitched into the seventh inning  zack wheeler and steven matz posted calamitous e r a s of     and     <BRK>mazzone went to cooperstown in   for the hall of fame induction of maddux and glavine  they got to yakking before the ceremony  and mazzone asked what they would have done if  in the course of pitching a world series shutout  he had come to the mound to pull them from the game <BRK>glavine looked at him  smiled thinly and replied   mazz  we were going to have a fight on that mound  <BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK>
