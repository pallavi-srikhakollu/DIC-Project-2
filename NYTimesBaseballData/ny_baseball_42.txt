in search of a way to save his career  the yankee  newest reliever and his father built a pitching oasis uptown <BRK>adam ottavino  a former relief pitcher for the colorado rockies  warmed up last month at a facility he rent in harlem from his father in law  he said it had helped him improve his velocity and cook up a devastating slider creditcreditmichael owen for the new york time<BRK><BRK>by matt foley<BRK>photograph and video michael owen<BRK>the ambient pop of a catcher s mitt greets you before you see the interior of the lab  inside the unmarked door on st  nichola avenue in harlem  pat the canva tarp blacking out the window and around the ladder serving a a makeshift camera stand  awaits an   foot long pitching mecca where the outside world quickly disappears  <BRK>the hurried passer by might think this place amiss  but the former shoe store two block from the apollo theater and beneath a chuck e  cheese s feel just right to the ballplayer who trek uptown to hone their craft  <BRK>on a wednesday in january  that group included adam ottavino  the facility s gatekeeper  host and a major league reliever for the past seven season  four minor league pitcher  and one baruch college catcher  ottavino s father  john  an actor based in brooklyn  is also there <BRK> these guy are just a bunch of big kid   said the older ottavino  gesturing to the men aged   to     i come in and clean the place once a week  if they can t find something  i usually know where it is  <BRK>on this day  that meant finding a misplaced blue lacrosse ball that his son us for warm up exercise  on any other wednesday  adam ottavino would be throwing off the portable pitching mound  but on the eve of the day his life would change  there wa a bit too much at stake <BRK>  something good might be happening soon   a coy ottavino told the five fellow ballplayer who hope to follow in his footstep   i can t get injured today   <BRK>the next day  jan     ottavino  a   year old right hander from park slope  completed a three year     million contract with the yankee <BRK>at the lab  ottavino sat behind a laptop and a tripod  filming his friend with a small  blue     frame per second camera and giving advice between pitch  the camera are part of the data driven pursuit with which ottavino ha saved his career  now  after a breakout   seaon with the colorado rockies  he s spreading the word a he prepares for spring training  which open thursday  <BRK> you learn thing in here  about preparation and practice  that you didn t even expect to pick up   said alex katz  a st  john s alumnus now in the chicago white sox organization  when katz finished throwing  one of the lab s most loyal regular  a   year old left hander named andres caceres  took the mound  a queen native and veteran of independent league  caceres is trying to perfect a cutter with ton of late movement <BRK>  whatever it is  it s filthy   said ottavino  suggesting caceres put more pressure on his pointer finger  <BRK>aked about his role a the veteran sage in a circle of peer still chaing their major league dream  ottavino wa direct  he s no one s superior  nor ha he cracked some magic code  rather  he is still searching for way to improve <BRK>  i don t ever want to be the guy who s always telling people what they re doing right or wrong   ottavino said   but if i do have some insight  i try to be fair about sharing it and see if we can get each other better  i learn from these guy all the time  <BRK>a die hard yankee fan  ottavino wa at david well s perfect game in   and attended the team s fanfest annually with his father  ottavino played ball at the youth service league in brooklyn and graduated from berkeley carroll school in park slope in    three year later  he wa drafted the st  louis cardinal in the first round out of northeastern university  <BRK>he made his debut with the cardinal in   and wa claimed off waiver colorado in    after missing most of two season because of tommy john surgery  ottavino struggled mightily in    he logged a     earned run average and   walk in       inning and wa left off the playoff roster  <BRK> i knew the next year wa do or die for my career   ottavino said   but that s the stuff i really enjoy   attacking the root of the problem  it s better that i hit rock bottom because i wan t holding on to anything i d done before  <BRK>a power pitcher with a dominant slider  ottavino decided his command and consistency needed fixing  having spent time at driveline   a data driven performance training center in washington state   he determined that videotaping every practice session would be his answer  rather than making adjustment based on  feel  or opinion  fully committed to coaching himself  he bought two camera   a rapsodo to measure spin rate and a high speed edgertronic sc  that compress each pitch into a slow motion replay  then he worked to become more fluent in the data  <BRK>the resulting knowledge  he said  helped establish a consistent foundation and led to increased confidence  the only problem  ottavino had nowhere to do any of this  his off season throwing partner  the mets starter steven matz  had moved away  and daily trip to a facility on long island ate up too much time that could be spent with his wife and two toddler  <BRK>in stepped his father in law  a developer with a vacant harlem storefront for rent  after ottavino  with his father s help  spent two week laying turf  buying equipment and learning to use the camera  the lab wa in session and the real fun began  <BRK> if he didn t have this place   john ottavino said   it might have been over for him  <BRK>ottavino wa one of the best reliever in baseball last season with a     e r a  and a career best   strikeout to   walk in       inning  he held right handed batter to a devastating    average and ranked  th in the major with     strikeout per nine inning  he shut down a chicago cub rally in the national league wild card game last season  proving capable of getting postseason out  can he do it in the bronx <BRK>ottavino said the time spent hidden in harlem    scheming in an evil lair   he joked   had prepared him for the challenge  <BRK> you want to show up to spring training with a secret weapon   he said <BRK>the topic of pitching at yankee stadium ha often been discussed  in december  he boasted on a podcast that he  would strike babe ruth out every time  because player these day are so much better prepared physically  <BRK> if i have a slow start  i ll never hear the end of it   he said <BRK>the lab  in it current state  will close for good this month  ottavino  katz  caceres and the other honorary member will report to their respective club with new trick to unveil  hoping to rescue or advance however much career they have left  <BRK>ottavino  his wife and the child are moving to the suburb  where he said he would find a suitable space in westchester county for another lab  so long a it s hidden  preferably in a dark baement  or maybe a wooded cabin <BRK><BRK>
