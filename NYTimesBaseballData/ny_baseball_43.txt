 <BRK>  <BRK> by jay schreiber <BRK> on july       men walked on the moon in what became the centerpiece of one of the more indelible year in american history  <BRK> that same day    year ago  the new york mets split a doubleheader with the montreal expo  you could say  so what  but the mets  until then a baseball punch line  had suddenly become a team to reckon with in the eighth year of their existence  the two game against the expo gave them a     record  which meant they were a big  fat   game over     considering everything that had come before for the mets   the initial buffoonery  the occasional lunacy  the lopsided losing record   it seemed that they  too  were now defying gravity  <BRK> a month later  on the same weekend a the woodstock music festival  the mets really took flight  they swept four game from the san diego padre and began a surge that carried them into first place in september and all the way to the world series in october   which they proceeded to win  in five game  against the heavily favored baltimore oriole  <BRK> when it wa over  after the mets had been drenched in ticker tape in a parade up broadway   a feat that had been unimaginable when the season started   it took a while for people to regain their sens  <BRK> just how had this happened  yes  the mets had excellent pitching  solid defense at key position and some very good young player  but their lineup wa hardly overwhelming  and yet  that didn t matter in the regular season  when the mets won a whopping   game and  in the process  beat out a chicago cub team that played three future hall of famers every day  <BRK> nor did it matter in the national league championship series  when the mets swept an atlanta brave club led henry aaron  one of the best player in the sport s history  or in the world series  when the mets went up against a mighty oriole team anchored the two robinson  frank and brook  the oriole  winner of   game in the regular season  seemed unbeatable until the mets quickly proved otherwise  <BRK> making this all the more remarkable is that the   mets did not represent the beginning of a dynasty  in the season that followed  the mets won considerably fewer game and while they did make it back to the world series in    they did so almost accident  having finished the regular season with a thoroughly mediocre     record  <BRK> but none of that diminishes what occurred in    here wa a group of player who stumbled all over the place in    with fan who embraced them almost in defiance  a team that slowly improved in the year that followed  but only slowly  and yet a team that proceeded to figure it all out for one intensely memorable season  <BRK> it is not easy to explain  but   year later  it is worth revisiting  time ha taken it toll on this team  a half dozen player who had significant role have died  and others  including tom seaver  are now struggling with serious health issue  but what endures through all the bittersweetness is what they accomplished together  from the depth of the standing they soared right into space  <BRK> next up     the bumbling beginning <BRK> george vecsey wrote about the mets in the  s for newsday and the new york time  robert lipsyte covered the mets in the  s for the new york time  both a a beat writer and a columnist  the archival material in this section is drawn from article a number of time writer  leonard koppett  joseph durso  louis effrat  gerald eskenazi  robert lipsyte  joseph lelyveld  robert teague  george vecsey and gordon s  white  additional material in this section wa written jay schreiber  research wa provided fred bierman  elena gustines  wayne kamidoi  dolores morrison and joe ward  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
