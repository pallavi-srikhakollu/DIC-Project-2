could not return to the yankee that season  since he risked contracting an infection  when the yankee beat the mets in the world series  zimmer called stottlemyre at his home <BRK> when mel answered the phone  he sounded ecstatic   zimmer remembered   later on that night  i found out that mel s brother had died earlier in the day of a brain tumor  he never said a word about it on the phone becaue he didn t want to ruin the night for the rest of u  that s what kind of a person he is  <BRK>melvin leon stottlemyre wa born on nov        in hazleton  mo   and grew up in mabton  wah   the son of a construction worker  he wa signed the yankee organization in   out of what wa then yakima valley junior college  now yakima valley college  in wahington state <BRK>when stottlemyre joined the yankee

pitcher <BRK>he had a     record in    when he led the a l  in complete game  with    and inning pitched  with    the yankee were beginning to fade then  finishing sixth in what wa then a   team league  stottlemyre won   game and lost   in   when they finished last for the first time since    but he rebounded to go     in   and     in   <BRK>in june    while pitching against the california angel  stottlemyre tore his rotator cuff  over the winter  he wa advised the yankee to rest until at least may    when they released him at the end of spring training  he wa stunned  the move wa made the team s general manager  gabe paul  but stottlemyre wa convinced that the yankee owner george steinbrenner had been behind it  and it left him embittered <BRK>stottlemyre retired with a record of     and an earned run average of     before turning to a second career a a pitching coach  but a family tragedy took him away from baeball for a time and ultimately colored his already bittersweet feeling toward yankee management <BRK>in march    stottlemyre s son jaon died of leukemia a few day after his  th birthday  stottlemyre left his post a a roving pitching instructor for the mariner the next year to be with his family  two decade later  reflecting on the possibility of a connection between his multiple myeloma and his son s leukemia  stottlemyre thought back to radiation treatment he had received on his shoulder from the yankee  team doctor in the late  s a a mean of reducing calcification  a radiologist had advised him to stop the treatment because of potential health consequence  and he eventually did so despite what he said were reasurances from the yankee  medical staff that the radiation would not harm him <BRK> i ve become convinced it played a role in both of the disease   stottlemyre said of the radiation in his memoir   pride and pinstripe       written with john harper   the medical care the yankee provided wa not up to the standard you d expect in professional sport  and certainly not from one of the most successful sport franchise in history  <BRK>after a break from baeball  stottlemyre became the mets  pitching coach in    gooden s rookie seaon  he did not tinker with the mechanic of the immensely gifted gooden  but counseled him on how to handle the spotlight and saw himself a something of a father figure <BRK>when the mets defeated the boston red

for two decade in anger over what he considered the bad faith the team showed releasing him in    but he decided to accept the offer  joining the staff of the new yankee manager  joe torre  when he came to believe that paul  the general manager  not steinbrenner  had been responsible for letting him go <BRK>the yankee won the world series in    then captured consecutive championship from   to    the year stottlemyre began treatment for multiple myeloma <BRK>stottlemyre guided pitching staff that included cone  rivera  andy pettitte  roger clemens  mike mussina  david well and gooden  who wa
