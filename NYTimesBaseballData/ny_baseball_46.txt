<BRK><BRK>by james wagner<BRK>st  petersburg  fla    everything wa in place at the vinoy renaissance hotel for luis severino s arbitration hearing friday morning <BRK>the panel wa there  waiting to hear the case presented each side  severino  the ace of the yankee  rotation  who wa eligible for salary arbitration for the first time in his career  wa at the hotel with his agent  they were prepared to make their pitch that he should be paid      million for the   season  representative for the yankee  who believed severino wa worth      million  were also present <BRK>but just before friday s meeting  brian cashman  the yankee  general manager  called one of severino s agent to negotiate <BRK>the hearing wa hastily postponed  and soon the two side had an agreement   one that underscored an increasingly wary climate between player and management across the sport <BRK>the four year deal guarantee severino    million  according to people familiar with the deal who requested anonymity because the term had not been made public  instead of going year to year with severino s salary  the agreement buy out all four season in which he wa eligible to go to arbitration  for severino  who will turn   next week  the deal protects against injury or underperformance  and the yankee guard against severino s value skyrocketing with a potential cy young level season <BRK>severino forfeited what would have been his first season of free agency  in    the deal includes a team option for    million that year or a      million buyout <BRK>the contract also hold hint of player  fear amid tense labor relation in the major  severino s deal is front loaded  he will earn    million in   and    million in    and then is to receive only modest raise to      million in   and    million in    in other word  he will earn      million of the    million guaranteed the   season <BRK>why  the current collective bargaining agreement between major league baseball and the player  union run through the   season  so severino is protecting himself against a potential work stoppage <BRK>the deal is also a sign of the yankee  willingness to lock up the young core of player that ha spearheaded their recent stretch of winning  severino  who signed with the yankee out of the dominican republic in    when he wa    blossomed into a hard throwing ace who wa named an all star in   and   <BRK>he ha thrown at least   inning each of the last two season and posted a combined e r a  of     across both year  in that stretch  the yankee were     in game he started <BRK> he s a great pitcher   said manager aaron boone  unable to comment on the deal until it wa announced later in the day   i hope he s here for a long time  <BRK>severino is the first in a long line of young star the yankee may try to secure for year to come  once led older player  the yankee overhauled their roster in recent year and built around a core of younger homegrown player  aaron judge  gary sanchez  dellin betances  miguel andujar and severino  or player that blossomed after arriving in the bronx  didi gregorius  gleyber torres and aaron hick  <BRK>a that core grows together  start earning more or inch closer to free agency  the yankee are weighing way of keeping it together  in particular  they like three standouts who can become free agent after this seaon  betances     hick     and soon to be   gregorius  although his recovery from tommy john surgery hurt his value <BRK>judge and sanchez are   and will be eligible for arbitration for the first time next seaon  so the yankee may wait until then to broach long term contract talk  a they did with severino <BRK>but the balance in negotiation seems to be tilting toward the club  a free agency is no longer the hallowed ground that player once dreamed about  off seaons have turned into protracted dance with team  evidenced the superstar bryce harper and manny machado  and many other top player  remaining unsigned a spring training begin <BRK>one effect ha been an increasing number of player signing deal considered team friendly before reaching free agency  while that trend ha drawn some scrutiny   some frowned on the philadelphia phillies ace aaron nola s recent four year     million extension  which could end up costing him two free agent season and keep him off the market until his age   season   some player seem to have accepted the writing on the wall about future earnings <BRK>in severino s case  if the yankee pick up his   option  he will be a free agent for his age   season  so he can still earn more if he keep performing and stay healthy  patrick corbin  whom the yankee wooed but failed to sign this winter  signed a six year     million deal with the washington national and will turn   in july <BRK>an additional benefit of friday s agreement for both side  avoiding the actual arbitration hearing  which can be contentious and leave a bad tate with player who watch their team list off their weakness a it argues for a lower salary  the yankee engaged in an ugly war of word with betances s agent in    and trevor bauer of the cleveland indian this week called an argument presented m l b  s labor relation staff  which is also present in the hearing   a character asasination  <BRK>severino  at the last minute  avoided all that  it wa around     a m  on friday that one of severino s agent walked out of the vinoy renaissance and got into a car  soon thereafter  cashman emerged and also drove off  word soon spread that the yankee and their young ace had a new deal
