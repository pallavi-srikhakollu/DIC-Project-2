 <BRK>  <BRK> by kevin draper <BRK> the best way to understand mike trout  the outfielder for baeball s los angeles angel  who on tuesday reportedly agreed to the richest contract in north american sport  is a the perfect reflection of his sport  <BRK> little known to many american  including some sport fan  trout     is the best player in a game that ha frequently been mocked a a fading form of entertainment with primarily regional audience  <BRK> baeball is often dismissed a far le enticing than the n f l   which is believed to bring in more than    billion annually even with it health and safety issue  baeball also is called le dynamic than the n b a   even though it had about    billion le in revenue than m l b  lat year  <BRK> so when trout s   year     million contract wa revealed  it prompted an obvious question  how could a sport that is struggling to attract a new generation of fan  and that is facing a potentially bruising labor fight with it player in two year  afford yet another nine figure contract  <BRK> news of trout s deal came about three week after outfielder bryce harper accepted a   year     million contract  with the phillies and a month after infielder manny machado got a   year     million deal from the san diego padre  <BRK> a comparison of all the major league baseball player who signed contract of at least    million  <BRK> the answer ha more to do with the mechanic of the collective bargaining agreement between player and owner than with anything that might constitute a referendum on the game s popularity  there are several dynamic at work in the sport  where huge wealth still flow to the best of the best  while there is le money left over for the so called middle class  despite continuing growth in baseball s revenue  <BRK> owner  it seems  have figured out how to keep cost down using younger player  who are cheaper than veteran  thus freeing up cash for the occasional megadeal  player like trout  harper and machado benefit  while others are forced to accept le  <BRK>  in the past  team were valuing player differently   said james paxton  a starting pitcher for the yankee   for a long time  that system wa fine  now that the team have changed the way they re valuing player  especially older player  it s kind of broken the system and it is forcing u to take a look at it   <BRK> in a study that ha not yet been published  j c  bradbury  an economics professor at kennesaw state university  calculated that baseball revenue rose at an average rate of     percent from   to    while player salary rose at an average rate of just     percent  <BRK> major league baseball revenue reached      billion last year  the source include evermore money from guaranteed source  like multibillion dollar medium deal for the entire sport and other lucrative medium contract  many at the local level  le important have been ticket sale  which generally fluctuate with win and loss  <BRK> with the shift in valuation of player  the average salary went down in   for the first time in   year  to a little more than    million   according to the player association  it wa just the fourth time in the last   year that the average ha gone down  <BRK> dan halem  the deputy commissioner of m l b   said there wa no evidence of team not trying to win  and he painted a very different picture of baseball s economics  <BRK> salary have gone up on average     percent each year since    keeping pace with baseball s revenue growth during that time  he said  and while the pay may have been slightly down or flat in    one year doe not make a trend  he also said that over the last decade the player had received a consistent percentage of the game s revenue  from   to   percent  <BRK>  in a market based system  depending upon the year and how our club are valuing player   said halem   certain player do better than others   <BRK> yet word like  collusion  and  strike    once the third rail of the sport  especially after the ruinous strike of       are now regularly uttered player and agent   despite the huge contract  <BRK> focusing on giant deal miss the bigger picture  according to jeff borris  a longtime baseball agent who ha represented star like barry bond  and is now the general counsel of the ballengee group  a sport representation agency  <BRK>  contract like trout s and harper s are aberration   borris said   the focus should be more on thing like why isn t dallas keuchel signed or the contract that gio gonzalez just signed  those are the area that are of concern   <BRK> keuchel  a two time all star starting pitcher for the houston astros  remained unsigned one week before opening day  while gonzalez  a solid  durable starting pitcher  ha signed a minor league deal with the yankee  <BRK>  i think the owner are manipulating the system to their advantage   borris said  <BRK> for decade  baeball player have been represented what is widely considered to be the strongest union in all of professional sport  a a result  baeball ha no limit on salary  though it luxury tax  which penalizes a team after it payroll rise above    million  can function a a de facto cap  <BRK> the problem now  at leat a articulated player  is that while team reward superstar  they no longer feel compelled to spend to win if they do not believe they already have the piece in place to compete for a championship  <BRK>  why is there not an interest in player that can help team win  particularly a we get to the lat two week of spring training   tony clark  the executive director of the player asociation  said before the trout deal wa reached  <BRK> despite baseball s strong union  certain provision that kept salary rising for decade turned out to be norm  not hard and fast rule  <BRK> baseball player do not become free agent until they accrue six year of service time  they are generally paid at the league minimum for their first three season  while in the next three they can receive higher salary through negotiation or arbitration  this lead to odd situation like trout s being voted the american league most valuable player in his third full season while earning just    million  <BRK> this used to be acceptable to player because they made up for it on the back end of their career  there are the infamous albatross contract given to veteran  like the    million extension signed ryan howard in    but most of the time it wa veteran player being paid a fair wage  or being slightly overpaid  well into their  s  and sometimes  s  <BRK> it s not a coincidence that trout  harper and machado all got their megadeals at the age of   or younger  but a the circumstance of older player like gonzalez and keuchel demonstrate  team have been working on the asumption that a veteran s ability are likely to decline soon after his salary peak and that it make sense to use younger player  who can fill out a roster at lower cost and risk   even if the chance to make the playoff is also reduced  <BRK>  i don t think that we thought that team all of a sudden were going to just stop competing to the degree that they are now   said adam ottavino  a yankee pitcher   a lot of thing changed really fast   <BRK> email kevin draper at kevin draper nytimes com or follow him on twitter   kevinmdraper  <BRK> tyler kepner and james wagner contributed reporting  <BRK>  <BRK>
