 <BRK>  <BRK> extra base <BRK> wes johnson  the first pitching coach to jump from college to the major  is part of a tech savvy generation that eschews the eyeball test  <BRK> by tyler kepner <BRK> when wes johnson started his coaching career  in   at abundant life high school in sherwood  ark   he quickly learned what he needed to win  invariably  his team would end their season losing close playoff game to dominant pitcher  johnson began a quest to find out how to build an ace  <BRK> his skill at doing so led to several college job  most recently a the pitching coach for the university of arkansa  his platform for an unusual leap this seaon  to the minnesota twin  johnson is believed to be the first pitching coach to jump from college to the major league  <BRK> in johnson s first game  on march    starter jose berrios and the bullpen gave him just the kind of victory that once eluded him  a     gem over the cleveland indian  the twin totaled   strikeout    in each game  in their three game opening series  an encouraging sign for a staff that ha struggled for year to master the art of power pitching  <BRK> the indian have no such trouble  four of their starter topped   strikeout last season  helping the team win it third consecutive american league central title  for the twin to challenge  they need johnson s pitcher to respond to his modernized approach  which relies heavily on biomechanics  <BRK>  i m going to come in and tell them the why   johnson said  repeating what he told the twin  top baseball official  derek falvey and thad levine  in his job interview   the biggest thing is   why are we doing something   and it s not going to be a subjective why  it s going to be   percent objective through science or through their data  if we re going to make a change to a guy  we can t just make a change because it doesn t please our eye   <BRK> johnson     personifies a trend in baseball  pairing tech savvy coach with a generation of player who crave actionable data  the coach s pitching background is largely irrelevant  like johnson  the new pitching coach for the los angeles angel  doug white   the seattle mariner  paul davis  and the cincinnati red  derek johnson  formerly of the milwaukee brewer  never pitched in an affiliated professional league  <BRK>  those are the four that maybe never did anything  never played pro ball  that are going to be cutting edge   said brent strom     the pitching coach for the houston astros   i m just glad i m getting out now while they re coming up  i might just slyly get out of here and let them take over  these guy  they know their stuff   <BRK> before his college coaching career   which wound through central arkansas  dallas baptist  mississippi state and arkansas   johnson connected with strom through pat harrison  a mutual friend  strom invited johnson to a clinic featuring paul nyman  a pioneer in sport science who emphasized momentum over balance in a pitcher s delivery  with research  rather than conventional wisdom  to support his theory  <BRK> at smaller college  especially  johnson tended not to have the most polished prospect  who had signed professionally or chosen larger program  to compete  he specialized in development  imparting the lesson he learned from nyman  strom and others like ron wolforth  the founder of the texas baseball ranch  who hosted clinic they all attended  <BRK> wolforth cited johnson s personality and curiosity a reaons for his unlikely rise  <BRK>  he s so bubbly  and he just bounce off the wall with energy   wolforth said   for those first   year or so  from high school to central arkansa to dalla baptist  he started to experiment with some thing and find out what worked  and a he did that  he would add the next brick  some thing were just accepted dogma  but wes wa really interested in a different perspective  he looked at thing upside down   <BRK> falvey  a former indian executive who joined the twin a chief baeball officer in october    met johnson at a wolforth clinic and followed him from afar  when the twin fired paul molitor a manager after lat seaon and restructured the coaching staff  falvey  a former pitcher at trinity college  turned to johnson  intrigued his many year of studying the craft  <BRK>  there s an argument to be made that in college circle  in the last few year  anyway  they may have been using more information and technology than we were on the pro side   falvey said  adding later   in the professional game  the traditional way of getting on the field wa  you finish playing and you become a coach  there wa no real in between step of learning and developing   <BRK> strom did pitch professionally  for five major league season in the  s  but his astros pitcher respond to him because of his information and ability to convey it  the astros  staff led the major in strikeout last season  and strom said the twin could be similarly transformed  <BRK>  they re going to be much  much better because of wes   he said   for year  the twin had always had the reputation of inducing contact  so they wouldn t strike out many people  it reminded me of when i wa with the cardinal  induce ground ball  sinker  that kind of stuff  wes is bringing four seam fastball  elevated pitch  sequencing pitch  and he know the delivery very well because he s studied it  <BRK>  it just go to show you that player don t really care who you are  they care if you care  and wes really care  he care for the player   <BRK> the twin have needed a change  in the eight full season since their last division title  in    they had the fewest strikeout per nine inning in the major  just      they were pitching to contact with poor result  allowing a    average on ball in play in those season  worse than every staff except colorado s   and inducing soft contact just     percent of the time  matching arizona for the worst such figure  according to fangraphs  <BRK> last season  though  the twin set a franchise record for strikeout        almost precisely the league average  but they also issued   walk  their most in   year  johnson said the twin would use data to devise more effective pitch sequence  tailored to each pitcher s stuff and physiology  <BRK>  i ve been aked that question   what s your pitching philosophy    johnson said   well  i ve got one for mike pineda  i ve got a completely different one for martin perez or kyle gibson or jake odorizzi  because their body work different  their stuff play different  they need different thing in the training room  some guy need more momentum  some guy don t need a much momentum  some guy throw across their body because they ve got loose hip  so you may not change that guy  but another guy who throw across his body  because he s got tight hip  you ve got to change him   <BRK> that last idea brought a smile to jim kaat  the ace of the twin    a l  championship team  kaat  now a television analyst for the twin and mlb network  thrived under the pitching coach johnny sain  a progressive instructor for his time who understood spin better than his contemporary and encouraged hip rotation through rudimentary drill  <BRK>  we did those thing in the old fashioned method  but now they can actually show you where you could improve   percent    percent   kaat said   all that stuff  johnny would be interested in it for sure   <BRK> the method of measurement have changed  but for the wisest pitcher and coach  the desire to evolve never end  <BRK> ron darling  mets broadcaster and former pitcher  issued a statement on the morning of the team s home opener thursday saying that he stand the story in his new book but would have no further comment because of a legal threat  <BRK> the book     stitch  loose thread  ripping yarn  and the darndest character from my time in the game   wa released tuesday st  martin s press and accuses lenny dykstra of shouting racist taunt at boston red sox pitcher oil can boyd before game   of the   world series  dykstra   who then homered off boyd to start the mets  comeback in that series   ha vehemently denied the story  and some   teammate have supported him publicly  <BRK> without wading into that controversy  it should be noted that dykstra is mentioned on just four of the   page in a spirited  revealing read  darling is an exceptional broadcaster because of the refreshing honesty underlining his communication skill  and those quality come through in the book  written with daniel paisner  darling give his unvarnished opinion of player  manager  coach and broadcaster  spiced with colorful  revealing anecdote that only a perceptive former teammate would know  <BRK> frank howard  his first manager  did not travel with a suitcase  a clubhouse attendant would wah his only set of clothes at the ballpark every day while howard wa in uniform  kevin mitchell  a teammate in    chased down a mugger on a boston street after darling won game   of the world series  alejandro pena  a mets reliever in the early  s  had darling s favorite clubhouse nickname  dirty  stinky  rotten  filthy al pena  <BRK>  i never knew why   darling writes   he wasn t dirty  stinky  rotten or filthy  but that s what we called him  in full  and  best of all  he answered to it   <BRK> the dykstra accusation is serious  of course  and darling is also critical of others for lesser offense  but with a thorough reading  the book is just a memorable for the whimsical  breezy tidbit that add texture to some of well known character he ha known in a long  honorable career in baeball  <BRK> elvis luciano had never pitched above the rookie league when the toronto blue jay chose him eighth over all in december in the rule   draft  to keep him in their organization   without offering him back to his previous team  the kansa city royal   the blue jay would have to put luciano on their major league roster  they did  and he made his debut on march   with one and a third scoreless inning  <BRK> that wa noteworthy  if unremarkable  some rule   draft choice always end up on the roster of rebuilding team  what make luciano distinctive is his birth date  feb        he became the first player born in the  s to appear in a major league game  <BRK> judging recent history  luciano ha a high standard to meet  based on a list provided the elia sport bureau  the last three first of their decade major leaguers have had long  successful major league career  <BRK> the first major leaguer born in the  s  pitcher wilson alvarez  lasted   season  throwing a no hitter and making an all star team  the first from the  s  the los angeles angel slugger albert pujols  is the only player with   home run      hit and two world series championship  the first from the  s  miami marlin shortstop starlin castro  ha made four all star team and once led his league in hit  <BRK> then again  others made a much smaller impact  the first player from the  s  joe cicero  played briefly for the boston red sox in   and    and then roamed the minor until resurfacing with the   philadelphia athletics  tim conroy  the first player from the  s  pitched twice for the oakland athletics in     just day after he wa drafted from a pennsylvania high school   and went     over all for the a s and the st  louis cardinal  <BRK> fortunately for luciano  he ha already done more in his career than the first major leaguer born in the  s  john cavanaugh  a philadelphia phillies third baseman who wa born on june       cavanaugh made his debut on july       striking out against jesse barnes of the new york giant in his only at bat  he never appeared in the major again  <BRK> tyler kepner ha been national baseball writer since    he joined the time in   and covered the mets for two season  then covered the yankee from   to      tylerkepner  <BRK>  <BRK>
