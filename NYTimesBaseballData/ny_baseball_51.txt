<BRK>but a team in the liga mexicana de béisbol decided that heimlich  now    merited an opportunity after serving his punishment and signed the left hander  who ha been throwing a hard a   mile per hour recently  during preseaon training on wednesday    he threw a bullpen session in his new uniform <BRK>it is unclear whether heimlich  who ha said that his criminal record ha been expunged  will be able to stick with his new team  the tecolotes de los do laredo  his signing ha drawn criticism from the victim s family and a prominent activist  and the tecolotes might become the second team

a contingent of mexican player were taking part in exhibition game   we have to analyze his case  it s very difficult to see him registered in the mexican league  <BRK>if he is blocked the league office  it would not be the first time  in august  the lamigo monkey in taiwan reached a deal with heimlich  but after a wave of criticism  the chinese professional baseball league declared that heimlich could not play there because of his criminal history and the effect on the league s image <BRK>salina said that the mexican league  which is affiliated with minor league baseball and is considered class aaa  had previously rejected player with checkered background involving problem like doping and gambling <BRK> the player ha to have irreproachable conduct and be a good representative of the team and the league   he said   like any league  we have to verify that all of our entrant have good conduct  we are an example to a lot of boy and girl  and we have to protect the image of the league  <BRK>josé antonio mansur  the owner of the tecolotes  said it wa a common practice for the league to have final say on a player s contract  but he added that the league had taken the unusual step of asking heimlich to sign a letter vowing good behavior  which he did on wednesday <BRK> i m not a judge   mansur said in spanish in a phone interview from laredo  tex   i m just a businessman  and i ll give him an opportunity  if he wa guilty  he s already been judged  i m just looking from here on forward  he ha this opportunity  just like any citizen who ha made a mistake  who han t tripped up in life and ha to get back up  <BRK>mansur said that a rejection of heimlich s contract would be discriminatory  salina said the league would make a decision  in the coming day  <BRK>last may  in an interview with the new york time  heimlich denied that he had committed the crime he admitted to  saying he had pleaded guilty to quickly dispense with the case and

next year at oregon state <BRK>reached on wednesday night  heimlich declined to comment <BRK>the victim s mother wa unaware of heimlich s new job until asked for comment   my view on the subject ha not changed nor will it  i don t believe he deserves a spot on any professional team   she wrote in a text message <BRK>brenda tracy  one of oregon s most prominent victim  right activist  who frequently speaks about sexual abuse in sport and on college campus  called heimlich s signing  really problematic  <BRK> this softens him   she said   because someone is giving him a so called second chance  it is paving the way for a team in major league baseball to sign him  they will say   mexico signed him  so we are not the only one  we were not the first one to do this   and that is wrong  it is ignoring the victim  and it is wrong  <BRK>she added   a i ve said before  second chance do not have to include playing sport  especially pro sport  because in our society  we put these athlete up on a pedestal  <BRK>the tecolotes  who have an unusual arrangement with home stadium on both side of the border  got in touch with heimlich s agent in january through an intermediary  talk became more serious last month before an agreement wa reached  mansur said the tecolotes  front office and coaching staff had watched video of heimlich from college and of a tryout in front of scout <BRK>in vetting heimlich  mansur said the team had spoken with heimlich s representative but not with heimlich directly  though he said he planned to meet with him later thursday in camp <BRK>mansur said he had consulted with his team s lawyer and with his family  which run the team  he did not speak with the victim or her family  he said  because they had already spoken to investigator and heimlich had already served his penalty  mansur said that he wa aware that the tecolotes were opening themselves up to criticism with the signing but that he believed heimlich should not be punished for life <BRK> for the fan  i ask that we all analyze ourselves   he said   this is really a kid who want to and ha decided to move ahead with his life  and like he say  to be an example and to be a good kid  i think he merit our support  <BRK>the league  however  may not feel the same way <BRK>kurt streeter contributed reporting <BRK><BRK><BRK>
