<BRK><BRK>by david gendelman<BRK>jupiter  fla    at   foot   inch and   pound with a mustache that wa part fu manchu and part facial hair experimentation  austin brice s appearance turned quite a few head over the past two season with the cincinnati red <BRK>his on field performance wa a different story  a a middle reliever splitting time between the major and minor league across   and    brice posted unspectacular number  a     record and a     e r a  but he had reaon to be optimistic entering what he thought would be his third seaon with the red  he appeared to have matered his control problem and had shown an ability to induce ground ball <BRK>but right around halloween  when he wa at home in chapel hill  n c   doing little more than repeatedly watching  finding nemo  with his   year old son and his wife  he received a phone call from nick krall  the red  general manager <BRK> there s not a long  drawn out conversation or storytelling   brice said   he said   we decided to make some move  so we have to let you go  we ve got to put you out   <BRK>in this case   put you out  meant removing brice from the red    man roster  a list that includes player available for regular season game  those on short term injured list  and a selection of minor leaguers who can be called up to the major at any time <BRK>so began m l b  s version of hot potato  with brice a the potato  when a player is removed from the   man roster  he is placed on waiver  at which point any m l b  team can claim him  for brice  it started a paradoxically itinerant three month  a he bounced around from team to team without moving much himself  by the time the miami marlin signed him on feb     the club wa his fourth of the off seaon <BRK>a week earlier  when he wa dropped the baltimore oriole after they had claimed infielder jack reinheimer  who wa himself joining his fourth team of the off season   brice tweeted   i think i found out why i m hitting waiver   i think team are just wanting to put out my mustache picture b  it change in the   season  it s a conspiracy   but for real waiver suck lol  <BRK>brice had become a resident in m l b  s no man s land  an exasperating limbo for player who find themselves on the bubble of the   man roster   good enough to get added  but not necessarily good enough to stay there  it s a situation a handful of player find themselves in every off season  one that can be bewildering and endlessly frustrating  testing player  resolve to fight their way into  or back into  the major league <BRK>hanser alberto  a   year old infielder from the dominican republic  experienced it this winter a he bounced around four team  including two stint with baltimore  where he is now  the angel  two way player kaleb cowart ha been on three team  including twice joining the angel  for player  the frustration is compounded their powerlessness to prove themselves <BRK> it s confusing   brice said   because you can t defend yourself with play in the off season  <BRK>alex hassan  the assistant director of player development for the minnesota twin  went through a similar experience during the     off season  making the round with three team before ultimately landing with the oakland athletics that spring <BRK>each time you re added to a roster  hasan said   you re trying to create this narrative in your head of how thing are going to work in your favor  because a the player you have to do that  if you don t  the odds are just so stacked against you that you d go crazy  <BRK>for a club s front office  each new signing can set off a domino effect that becomes hard to stop  when one position get filled  it often open up a need at another  and the team intensifies it search there  additionally  a player who fill a need one day can become redundant the next <BRK>at the end of the   seaon  andy wilkins  now   and a minor leaguer with the atlanta brave  wa a power hitting corner infielder who had yet to translate his minor league success to the major  one week after the seattle mariner signed him that december  the team traded for the veteran first baeman adam lind  whom wilkins referred to a  the major league version of me   wilkins wa dropped day later <BRK> it s about evaluating the player who becomes available   brian chattin  the marlin  assistant general manager  said of the constant roster shuffling <BRK>after ending up on four different team in a three week span that off season  wilkins said   i wa numb to the whole thing  <BRK>when he received a call that the milwaukee brewer had signed him  he wa at the hospital with his wife  who had just given birth to their first child   i didn t talk to them for too long   he said   i wa  like   whatever  we ll see if i get to spring training or not with you guy   <BRK>wilkins did  and though he didn t make the team to start the seaon  he wa called up in july  he had   plate appearance that summer  nearly all a a pinch hitter or late inning replacement <BRK>it wan t the role he d envisioned  but it wa the role he got   good pinch hitter are hard to find   wilkins said   it s difficult to succeed in that role  you have to understand that your rate of failure is going to be extremely high  <BRK>these player usually need to find a specific role on a team in order to stay there   i had clear reason why team were claiming me   hassan     said in a telephone interview from the twin camp in fort myers  fla   i got on base a lot  and i wa good against left handed pitching  it wa a niche skill set  <BRK>but it wan t enough to keep him with the a s  oakland designated hassan for assignment at the end of spring training  and he wa picked up four more team before the end of the season but never made it back to the major <BRK>brice  who had control issue early in his career  amusingly appealed to the marlin because of his ability to throw strike  the club also liked that his size suggests potential durability <BRK>but in order to make the team on opening day  he will need to improve his number against left handed hitter  in    lefty hit    against him and had an on base average of     compared to    and    against righties  <BRK>during a recent bullpen session  marlin manager don mattingly  the former left handed great for the yankee  stood at the plate against brice and gave him feedback on what a left handed batter see when facing him <BRK> you never know when a discussion like that is going to resonate with a player   said mel stottlemyre jr   the marlin pitching coach   it doesn t mean their stuff get nastier  it just mean they change their thinking  and that can make a big difference  <BRK>in eight appearance this spring  brice s e r a  is a stellar      and his strikeout rate is a high a it s ever been  stottlemyre ha noticed an urgency about him that he s seen before in player who have gotten stuck in baeball s virtual team exchange program   sometimes you can give those guy thing a little earlier than you would another player and hope that lightning strike in a bottle   he said <BRK>undoubtedly  brice is hoping for the same thing <BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK>
