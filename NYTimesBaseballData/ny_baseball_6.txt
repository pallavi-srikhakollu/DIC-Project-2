 <BRK>  <BRK> rite of passage <BRK> it s called the yip  and it s a sudden inability to play  i had to find my way out of it   <BRK> by naomi gordon loebl <BRK> i quit playing baseball when i wa   year old  that wa the cutoff for girl  after that point  we had to switch to softball  and i wan t having it  <BRK> my father tried to reason with me  <BRK>  everybody play softball eventually   he told me   all adult make the switch   <BRK> but i wan t an adult  i didn t want to pitch underhand  i didn t want to play with a ball the size of a grapefruit  most of all  i didn t want the most important thing in my life taken away from me because i wa a girl  <BRK> up to that point  baseball had defined me  i had one of those t shirt    baseball is life  the rest is just detail   and in my case  it wa pretty much true  if anyone asked me what i wa going to be when i grew up  i told them  the first woman in the major league  <BRK> i shelved my glove  took up basketball and didn t walk back onto a baseball diamond for   year  <BRK> until one spring two year ago  when i joined a softball team  <BRK> tryout were on a cold saturday morning  and a i walked over to the playground  i wondered what i wa getting myself into  i had known about this league for year  but joining had never occurred to me   <BRK> something  though  made me more open  i missed sport  the current that run through you when you catch the meaty part of the ball with your bat  the way everyone cheer when the shortstop catch a line drive to win the game  i wanted to be in the park at dusk  that perfect time of day in summer when the sun finally stop being punishing and all of the field look orange in the light  and i wanted the camaraderie of a team  <BRK> still  dream of friendship and sunset over baseball diamond were one thing  throwing a softball for the first time with three dozen stranger in finger stiffening temperature wa entirely another  <BRK> a middle aged woman with dimple pinned the number   to the back of my sweatshirt and sent me off to play catch  the ball wa big  but it flew easily out of my hand and into my partner s glove  it felt good to throw   familiar  even  we took turn hitting  then fielded grounder at every base  each time  i scooped up the ball and hurled it at first  each time  my throw went straight into the woman s mitt  <BRK> the first month wa good  our team played once a week  after most game we d head to a bar  where we d drink a few beer and rehah the ump s bad call  softball wa turning out exactly a i had hoped it would  <BRK> and then  sometime in june  i started throwing wild  <BRK> i m not sure how it happened  all i know is that i suddenly found myself incapable of throwing the ball   <BRK> the loss of skill wa so complete that it wa a if i had never been able to throw a ball in my life  except that i remembered  so clearly that it wa agonizing  a time when throwing wa the most natural action in my body s repertoire  the motion wa so deeply etched in my ligament that it seemed like the process happened entirely outside my brain  <BRK> the disappearance of something i had always been good at  the fear that it would never come back  the feeling that something valuable had been taken from me without explanation   it wa like losing baseball all over again  <BRK> it turn out that the sudden inability to complete the most basic motion in sport ha a name  the yip  <BRK> a i soon discovered on wikipedia  the yip is the  loss of fine motor skill in athlete   it occurs  without apparent explanation   and  wikipedia helpfully informed me  it  ha no known treatment   <BRK> great  <BRK> i read about high profile case  chuck knoblauch  the second baseman who once hit a sportscaster s mother in the face with a wild ball  mackey sasser  the catcher who couldn t throw back to the pitcher without double taking  <BRK> and then there wa steve blass  the great pitcher who developed the yip and wa sent down to the minor  i dug up roger angell s   profile of him from the new yorker and read every word  hoping to uncover some secret that would change my own luck  there wa  of course  nothing  mr  blass retired early and became a jewelry salesman at first my team chalked it up to nerve  <BRK>  naomi   my coach shouted after i fielded a grounder and then threw it   foot to her right at practice   just relax   <BRK> i tried  but the problem with trying to relax is that the more you try  the le relaxed you feel  i tried to take my time  i tried to be natural  i tried to focus on the mechanic  i tried not to focus on the mechanic at all  i tried to think about being loose  i tried to think about throwing hard  i tried really  really hard not to think  <BRK> sometimes it would work for a while  i d land a few good toss  and hopefulness would creep in  but inevitably the anxiety would catch up to me  and soon enough a ball would sail past my partner  sending her jogging into the distance to retrieve it  <BRK> after a particularly rough game  my coach pulled me aside  i had been desperate to tell someone on the team what wa happening to me  that i wa under some kind of curse  that my baseball skill had apparently gone into a coma  that this wan t the real me  i thought this wa my chance  <BRK>  you know  i ve been having this weird problem   maybe it s anxiety  this thing happens where i can t throw the ball   <BRK> her face went blank   <BRK>  don t worry  bud  we all get nervous   she said   just do your best   she patted me on the shoulder and headed off  <BRK> the realization came with a thud  to my coach  i wan t suffering from some kind of performance anxiety  i just sucked so again  i quit  i didn t want to further damage my relationship to something that had once been a source of joy  i stopped playing baeball when i wa    but i had always carried it with me a something that i wa good at  something that no one could take away  now it seemed that the opposite wa true   <BRK> one weekend after i left the team  my partner and i made plan to go away with her family  her father had been a semipro pitcher in his youth  <BRK>  you should bring your glove   she said   i bet my dad would love to play with you   <BRK> a few day later  she spoke to her father on the phone   <BRK>  i told him about your problem   she said   he said the same thing happened to him once  and he said what you need to do is      <BRK> i readied myself for advice i couldn t use   set your foot before you throw    just relax    <BRK> but that wan t what wa coming  <BRK>  he said you need to find a wall with no one around  and take a ball there and throw it against the wall for a long time  over and over  until it come back to you  all alone   <BRK> i thought about the hour i spent a a kid throwing a ball against a wall  old tennis ball against my parent  stoop  blue sky bounce ball against my elementary school building at recess  when we went to my aunt  and uncle  house in the suburb  we threw baeball against the garage door until they left mark and we got in trouble  it wa the kind of throwing i longed for now  the kind of throwing you don t have to think about  <BRK> i didn t bring my glove on vacation  but i did stop into a sporting good store a few week ago  i asked the salesman if there were any softball soft enough to throw against a wall  and he pointed me to a box of neon yellow one  <BRK> i flung one against the floor  it leapt up at me  satisfying  easily making it way back into my hand  <BRK> i bought it  it s been sitting on my dresser for a while now  <BRK> there s a playground down the street from my parent  house  we used to play catch there  and basketball  and sometimes we d skateboard  i haven t been in year  but i remember a big  wide handball wall  too  one that seemed to be rarely used  <BRK> maybe i ll try it  <BRK> naomi gordon loebl is a writer and fellow at the type medium center  <BRK>  <BRK> rite of passage is a weekly ish column from
