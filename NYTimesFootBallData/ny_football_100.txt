jason hairston played briefly in the n f l   hunted with donald trump jr  and owned a wildly successful hunting gear and apparel company  but he increasingly worried about a degenerative brain disease  <BRK> creditcreditpaul bride <BRK>  <BRK> by john branch <BRK> dixon  calif    the blast from upstairs shattered the quiet of a small town weeknight  it wa all so sudden  or had it been coming for year  <BRK> jason hairston had just been downstairs with his young son and daughter  who could not understand why their father wa acting so strange  his wife  on the phone from across the country  wa desperately trying to get her husband to say something  anything  <BRK> he ended the call without a word  walked upstairs and closed the bedroom door  he lay down on his wife s side of the bed  lifted a gun under his chin and pulled the trigger  <BRK> the son  cash  wa    old enough to have previously googled  c t e    wise enough to know what had just happened  poised enough to block his   year old sister  coco  from instinctively running upstairs toward the sound  he pulled her outside  the police and family member were on the way  <BRK> if there is such a thing a the american dream  hairston  at    gave every indication that he wa living it  he wa a former college football star who played briefly with two n f l  team  and he wa the founder of kuiu  a top end outfitter of hunting gear and apparel  he had legion of faithful customer and good friend who apired to be like him  <BRK> he traveled to the most remote and rugged edge of the earth in search of quiet adventure and big game  he had just returned from a caribou hunting trip in alaska with his father and son  and he had been sheep hunting with donald trump jr  in the yukon a couple of week before  <BRK> he had recently described his wife and business partner  kirstyn  during a  th anniversary dinner toat a  truly my rock  my soul mate  the most loyal wife you could ever have   <BRK> they had family photo that looked like the kind that come with the frame  they lived in a grandly renovated home just a block and a half from where kirstyn s family ran the city of dixon s favorite gathering spot  bud s pub and grill  at the corner of first and a street  it wa two mile from the headquarters of kuiu  which ha been heralded a a runaway business success  <BRK> hairston had it all  or so it seemed  then the gun went off  and the question echoed long after everything went quiet on that tuesday evening in september  <BRK> the case of jason hairston is unusual for at least two reason  first  he wa convinced  year ago  that he had chronic traumatic encephalopathy  or c t e   the progressive degenerative brain disease caused repeated hit to the head  it can be diagnosed with certainty only in the dead  but he and kirstyn  now    intensely studied the research  they saw a clear picture of hairston in all the data point and account of deteriorating brain  especially in football player  <BRK> second  hairston defied the image of a diminished victim of c t e  he wa in near perfect physical health  with   percent body fat and model handsome look  confident and charismatic to the end  his public persona contradicted the corruption he felt in his brain  <BRK>  he wa very open about it  but i just didn t see it   brendan burn  hairston s closest hunting partner and a kuiu executive  now co chief executive   said shortly after hairston s death   i wa like   dude  i think you re overthinking this  you re paranoid   because what you read about is the guy who can t get out his front door  he wa so sharp  maybe that s why i didn t think much about it  it wa conceptual  it wan t like we were on a sheep hunt and he s trying to skin a sheep with a spoon   <BRK> hairston wa a linebacker in high school and at the univerity of california  davis  not far from dixon  he signed with the san francisco  er in may    and spent part of the season on the team s practice squad  the denver bronco signed hairston the next may  but he left the game for good a month later with numbness from a lingering neck injury in college  <BRK> an avid hunter  he saw an open niche in high end hunting apparel  a market overlooked the like of the north face or patagonia  hairston co founded sitka gear in    and after a management shuffle  he moved on to start kuiu  a direct to consumer company  in    <BRK> hairston became kuiu s public face  an aspirational figure  photo and video of him hunting sheep  moose  bear and other big game were featured in the company s savvy social medium marketing and glossy catalog  forbes reported that kuiu did    million in sale in    <BRK> i spent time with hairston in dixon in   while exploring story idea   it eventually led to an article in   titled   the ultimate pursuit in hunting  sheep   hairston and burn played role   hairston wa focused and engaging  which made it a surprise when he mentioned that he thought he had c t e  <BRK> he had a history of concussion  he said  too many to remember  he wa fighting headache  mood swing  impulsivity   all symptom of c t e   which share characteristic with alzheimer s disease  <BRK> knowing that i had written many account of c t e   including one shortly before we met  about the former oakland raider quarterback ken stabler  he and kirstyn were inquisitive  <BRK> they used their full range of contact and money on doctor  test  medication and advice  all in hope of slowing the effect  hairston tried diet and hyperbaric chamber  the more he felt his mind slip  the more he exercised his body  the more he worried about time  the more thing he crammed into whatever time he had left  <BRK> in november    hairston emailed me a photograph of him and his son with goliath  an aging and elusive desert bighorn sheep they hunted on a tag purchased at auction for       that bid wa a part of the article published month earlier  <BRK>  he is the new ca state record ram    year old and a big a everyone who hunted him previously thought he wa   hairston wrote   enclosed are photo of my cah and i  it wa such an amazing experience to share with my son   <BRK> le than a year later  his suicide shocked family and friend  admiring stranger and loyal customer  it did not surprise kirstyn  who had watched the decline close up  <BRK>  we were really good at hiding it   she said  <BRK> the couple s suspicion were right  hairston had c t e  <BRK> bennet omalu  a clinical professor at  u c  davis  made the diagnosis at his lab in stockton  the result  part of a   page autopsy  had not previously been revealed publicly  <BRK>  he ha c t e   there is no question about it   omalu said in an interview  describing the buildup of abnormal and cell strangling tau protein he found across most region of hairston s brain   those are the telltale sign  undeniably  this wa almost a replica of mike webster s brain   <BRK> omalu discovered the disease in webster  a hall of fame lineman who played for the pittsburgh steelers and who died in   at age    that diagnosis connected c t e  to football in the national consciousness  and garnered omalu a measure of fame  he wa played will smith in the   movie  concussion   <BRK> a malady formerly attached to  punch drunk  boxer  c t e  ha now been found posthumously in more than   former football player  including more than   who played in the n f l   plus an array of athlete in sport ranging from hockey to soccer  rodeo to bmx  much of the research about the condition ha centered on brain injury in the military  <BRK> scientist are on the verge of being able to confidently diagnose c t e  in the living  it promise to be a game changer  leading to all sort of complex ethical question in sport  <BRK> when a football star receives a c t e  diagnosis  for example  who will decide whether he should stop playing  will high school  college and professional team have an obligation to test and reveal the result  will athlete in all sport  at all age  have the option to be tested  <BRK> hairston embodied some of that coming anxiety  during news medium interview in recent year  he sometimes mentioned offhandedly that he thought he had c t e  the conversation always moved on quickly  <BRK> even those who hunted with him regularly said they did not see cause for concern  paul bride  an outdoors photographer who worked for kuiu  accompanied hairston on all his expedition  <BRK>  i saw him on his best day  in the best place he could be   the mountain   bride said  <BRK> in hindsight  though  his friend said maybe hairston had become more forgetful  a bit le predictable  none of those close to him were alarmed enough to worry that he might end his life  he had it all  <BRK> privately  though  the hairstons struggled to hold it together  jason hairston routinely broke down and cried  kirstyn said  scared of where his brain wa headed  when a scan revealed deterioration in the frontal lobe that had not been present a year earlier  she said  hairston made her promise she would never make him have another test  because he did not want to know the result  <BRK> a slow decline over the past decade  she said  sped suddenly into a drop  <BRK>  the last   month  he wan t there   she said  sitting in the living room of the family home   it wa like a switch flipped  he wa so different  we were going from one crisis to another  i felt like i wa drowning   <BRK> impulsivity spiked through flash of infidelity and alcohol abuse   he had been in alcohol rehabilitation about   year earlier  kirstyn hairston said   hairston showed unfamiliar anger   toward the child  the family pet  other driver on the road  he sometimes fell to his knee with headache  complaining of ice pick to his brain  he dropped into dark period of depression  his wife said  tinged with fear of being alone   <BRK>  i knew it wa c t e    kirstyn said   i read everything i could  this wa such typical behavior for c t e   <BRK> she cried a she delved into detail  <BRK>  he said   if you leave me  i ll be dead in three month    she said   and i said   you ll be dead in a week   but i needed him for the kid  and i know he would have stayed for me   <BRK> the two were apart for most of hairston s last month  he went on two hunt  kirstyn wa invited to new york with friend  a rare time away  they crossed path at the sacramento airport  he wa on his way home  she wa on her way out  he took the child   <BRK>  he said   you think i can t take care of our kid for three night  i m good    kirstyn said   i said   o k   you always want it to work out   <BRK> they shared a long embrace  then spoke on the phone the next evening  discussing kuiu   kirstyn worked alongside her husband and remains the chairwoman and majority owner   jason ordered pizza for the child  the couple laughed at the role reversal  she said  usually she wa the one at home with them  <BRK> she wa at dinner in new york two hour later when her son called  saying that jason wa behaving oddly  she asked to talk to him  her husband held the phone to his ear but said nothing  he hung up  <BRK> kirstyn hairston called her parent  who lived a few block away  to ask them to rush to the house  <BRK> when she called her son again  the gun had already gone off  <BRK> the autopsy found a blood alcohol level of     percent  two to three time the typical limit for drunken driving  his system also contained sertraline and trazodone  prescription medication commonly used to combat depression and anxiety  <BRK> kirstyn hairston had a feeling the day would come  but not so soon  <BRK>  i thought i had another five year   she said through tear   i really did   <BRK> but she believed that if hairston ever took his life  he would shoot himself in the chest to preserve his brain for examination  a dave duerson did in    at age    and a junior seau did in    at     both posthumously received diagnosis of c t e   <BRK> still  omalu said there wa plenty of hairston s brain tissue to study  the answer he provided   the positive diagnosis of the c t e  that the hairstons long presumed   brought some measure of relief  <BRK>  i m not surprised jason killed himself   kirstyn hairston said   i m surprised he did it with our kid in the house  i m surprised he did it here  but would you want to live if you knew you were losing your mind  especially being really young and really healthy   <BRK> she let the question linger  unanswered  the house went quiet  <BRK> if you are having thought of suicide  call the national suicide prevention lifeline at
