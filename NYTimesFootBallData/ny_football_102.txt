 <BRK>  <BRK> by bill pennington <BRK> after the first series in sunday s super bowl  which ended in an interception  new england patriot quarterback tom brady angrily cocked his right arm and flung his helmet over a sideline bench  <BRK> behind him  coach bill belichick wa yelling in the direction of two assistant  who did not bother to turn around  <BRK> on the field  patriot linebacker dont a hightower had a potential interception ricochet off his hand  <BRK> brady went back out for the patriot  next offensive series of the first quarter and swiftly moved them into scoring position  but stephen gostkowski missed a field goal  the first kick he had missed in five game  watching near his team bench  brady turned and hurled a wad of white tape to the ground  <BRK> the patriot were having one of the ugliest performance of any of their nine super bowl in the belichick era  and that included the three game they lost  yes  the los angeles ram were falling apart  seemingly trying to give the game away  but the patriot had not run away from the confused  tentative ram  and they were still tied with them in the fourth quarter  <BRK> but then  like so many other time before  when it counted most  brady and the patriot rediscovered the brilliance that produced five previous super bowl victory  an offense once out of sync found a groove that led to a sparkling touchdown drive  <BRK> it wa brief  but it had the cool efficacy of an assassin  the name so familiar  edelman  gronkowski  sony michel  and the patriot  defense  which wa not even ranked in the top half of the n f l  this season  somehow kept the league s second ranked offense from scoring a touchdown  <BRK> second before the final whistle and a last  largely ceremonial play  the patriot began hugging one another in the huddle  second later  confetti showered the field and the patriot were     winner  <BRK> the struggle of the first three quarter were forgotten  a puzzling memory but of no consequence any longer  <BRK>  it wa tough   brady said on the field afterward   we just couldn t make the big play  we couldn t stay on the field on third down  it wa a weird game like that  we were doing so much right  but none of it mattered until the fourth quarter   <BRK> it wa  in many way  a microcosm of the patriot  season  they began the year      rallied and then fell apart again  but they made the playoff  capping their run with their sixth super bowl win   tying the pittsburgh steelers for the most  they did so outplaying three of the top team in the league  the los angeles charger  the kansa city chief and the ram  who could never figure out how to solve new england s   ever changing defense  <BRK> the patriot left their safety deep for much of the game but kept switching the position of their cornerback  keeping them in the ram  wide receiver  face on one series  and then backing off the next  and the pressure on ram quarterback jared goff wa relentless for much of the night  <BRK> a sloppy  listless game like sunday s might make it hard to immediately declare the patriot  championship run this century a one of the best in n f l  history  but the resilience and the ability to come out on top year after year is hard to argue with  <BRK>  it took all kind of way to get this done  even week week   brady said   we had to grind it out against the charger  at kansa city and obviously again tonight when we really struggled to find a rhythm  <BRK>  but i mean  world champ again  man  it s pretty unreal   <BRK> the tone of the game   chaotic  muddled  boring   wa evident from the beginning  the patriot were having their problem  but the ram  offense wa hapless  they had just two first down in the first half   <BRK> the patriot were marching but getting nowhere  <BRK> there wa one patriot having a spectacular game  wide receiver julian edelman  who had   reception for   yard and wa named game s most valuable player  in the first half alone  edelman made six catch that resulted in a first down  including a   yarder that set up a   yard gostkowski field goal and a     lead that lasted until intermission  the ram tied the game with a field goal of their own in the third quarter  <BRK> the pivotal drive of the game began when the patriot took control of the ball with   minute   second left in the fourth quarter  the first play of the possession wa a nice touch pa from brady  who lofted the football over the head of a defender a tight end rob gronkowski circled toward the sideline for   yard  <BRK> two more brady completion had the crowd at mercedes benz stadium chanting   bray dee   <BRK> brady then settled in the pocket and  behind the near flawless pas protection he had throughout the game  lofted a perfect spiral that dropped over the head of two fleet ram defender who were nonetheless helplessly chasing the   foot      pound gronkowski  <BRK> gronkowski wa hobbled for most of this season  sometimes comically so  and he is openly pondering retirement  but after two week to rest various leg and elbow infirmity  gronkowski looked rejuvenated  his   yard catch moved the ball to the ram     <BRK> in the huddle before the play  edelman looked at gronkowski and said   we need another one from you  bro  we need a huge play   <BRK> gronkowski said   he had been making all the play  i had to step up   <BRK> on the next play  michel bulled into the end zone for a     lead  a late gostkowski field goal sealed the outcome  <BRK> the patriot  bungling  frustrated and unsure of themselves for most of the game  had found a way to another championship   a they have so often before  <BRK>  i don t know what wa going on there for a while   it wa strange   brady said   i just know it doesn t matter anymore   <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
