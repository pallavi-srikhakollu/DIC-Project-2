 <BRK>  <BRK> by benjamin hoffman <BRK> the divisional round of the n f l  playoff ha come and gone  confirming some thing we knew   the patriot are devastatingly good at home  the chief play football like it s a video game  etc    while revealing some new wrinkle for both the four losing team and the victor headed to the conference championship game   <BRK> a we look ahead to next weekend  we can look back at what we learned from this week s game   <BRK> taysom hill is more than a decoy  the saint  backup quarterback wa called on primarily for short run this season  on three play in his team s win over philadelphia  the former brigham young star showed he is capable of far more than that  his   yard run on a fake punt set up the saint  first touchdown  and later in the game he very nearly caught a   yard touchdown pas from drew brees  and his arcing    yard touchdown pas to alvin kamara in the third quarter may have been overturned because of a holding penalty  but the ease with which hill hit kamara in stride on the deep throw is something defensive coordinator surely will not forget   <BRK> taysom hill had a touchdown to alvin kamara but it wa called backpic twitter com e zydgudp <BRK> tom brady can still summon that underdog spirit  after demolishing the los angeles charger       the patriot quarterback  who is about to appear in his eighth consecutive a f c  championship game  told reporter that no one belief in his team   i know everyone think we suck and can t win any game   he said  julian edelman  who passed reggie wayne for the second most career postseason catch a receiver  concurred  saying   we re the underdog this week  i m going to jump on that train and roll with it   <BRK> tom brady ha reached   conference championship in   completed seaon        a a starting quarterback  excluding     brady ha reached the conference championship at a higher rate than  pic twitter com r tq vpia <BRK> c j  anderson wa a terrific pickup for the ram  the six year veteran wa cut the carolina panther on nov     then tried and failed get a spot on the lowly oakland raider  and eventually landed in los angeles in week   a an insurance policy behind todd gurley  in three game for the ram  including their     win over the dalla cowboy on saturday  the   year old anderson ha rushed for a combined   yard and four touchdown  that anderson had   yard against the cowboy even though gurley wa back on the field spoke volume about the ram  faith in their backup   <BRK> the chief are more than just patrick mahomes  the second year quarterback is the justified focus of any defensive effort against kansa city after his   touchdown regular season  but the chief demolished the indianapolis colt      without mahomes throwing a touchdown pas  he did rush for a score  and the chief got three other rushing touchdown from three different player  including one in which damien williams juked a pair of colt defender nearly out of their shoe  <BRK> there is a limit to nick foles s magic  the eagle  backup quarterback came into the game with a     record in the playoff over the lat two seaon  and even had people debating how philadelphia would handle thing between foles and carson wentz if foles went on another extended playoff run  he started almost flawlessly on sunday  but when he got the ball back with his team down just   point in the fourth quarter  a pa of his sailed through alshon jeffery s hand and into the waiting arm of the saint  marshon lattimore  ending the eagle s hope  a so much of the foles s story line relies on thing inexplicably working out for the quarterback  that s the type of play that will end the debate quickly  <BRK> philip river still hate facing tom brady  the charger  quarterback ha had a fine career that could likely land him in the hall of fame  but he ha never beaten brady  that point wa again driven home   emphatically   on sunday  a new england s defender had river flailing right away  while brady calmly picked apart the los angeles defense  <BRK> the cowboy live and die ezekiel elliott  the superstar running back had an uncharacteristically poor game against the los angeles ram on saturday  carrying the ball   time for just   yard  in   career regular seaon game in which elliott ha carried the ball at leat   time  the cowboy have gone      but to find playoff success  dalla may need to find some more offensive balance  a it stand  they are     in the playoff since drafting elliott  <BRK> darius leonard is a monster  indianapolis wa eliminated kansa city  but leonard  the colt  rookie linebacker  got to show off how much ground he can cover  generating   tackle and recovering a fumble in the losing effort  if the colt  offense get fully healthy  and the defense can put more piece around leonard  indianapolis could be a dominant team in the near future  <BRK> n f c  championship  los angeles ram       at new orleans saint          p m   fox <BRK> a f c  championship
