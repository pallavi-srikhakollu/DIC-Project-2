<BRK><BRK>by marc tracy<BRK>when leslie smith  a high school senior from miami  made his official visit to the university of pittsburgh last month  he got an idea before a photo shoot in which he wa to pose wearing the panther  football uniform <BRK>he asked his mother  lucretia chapple  who wa accompanying him on his visit  to put on the jersey <BRK>his request wa too mild for her <BRK> she decided   i m going to put on the whole uniform    smith said <BRK>the result is a pair of picture of smith  who will suit up for pitt more regularly next seaon a a freshman linebacker  and chapple  who in year pat played baketball and ran track  both are clad in the school s blue and gold color  head to almost toe  they did not appear to have cleat that fit chapple   long hair flow from the back of her helmet <BRK> she look pretty good in that uniform   said smith s future coach  pat narduzzi   she look like a player  <BRK>parent of college age student have long proudly advertised where their student attend school on sweatshirt  bumper sticker  coffee mug  etc <BRK>but football parent   a special specie of sport parent   have a new twist on that this year  a national signing day dawn wednesday  the trend du jour is parent dressing up in uniform alongside their talented son <BRK>the resulting shot are  of course  posted to twitter and instagram  from which they ricochet across the web <BRK> i had buddy coming up to me being like   you know you re on barstool sport    said steve snyder  who posed alongside his son  sam  a tight end  during sam s official visit to missouri <BRK>there may be no bigger date on the calendar for college football team than signing day  since personnel overwhelmingly dictate a team s ultimate success or failure  for the pat two year  player have also been able to sign during a brief window in december  a smith did  but signing day is still when ultimate judgment about coach  recruiting is rendered <BRK> for college football  recruiting is the lifeblood   said luke stampini  a recruiting analyst at  sport   if you re not recruiting well  you re probably not going to be around for long  <BRK>the uniform photo op arguably reflects broader current in child rearing  it could be cat a helicopter parenting   or perhaps the next generation of helicopter parenting  in which the parent rope down from the chopper right after his child <BRK> this is the era of  we  parenting  i e    we have a midterm  we ve got a game tomorrow  we re being recruited top tier school    julie lythcott haims  a former stanford administrator and the author of  how to raise an adult   said in an email <BRK> if the child is wearing a jersey signaling their recruitment status  the we speaking parent want that cool jersey  too   she said  adding   but where doe this intertwined ness stop  <BRK>what the novelty undeniably reveals is a crucial secret to recruiting nowadays  for all the talk that prognosticator may offer about how well a certain linebacker mesh with a certain coordinator s defensive philosophy or how successful a college program is at developing player for the n f l   much of recruiting come down to the more basic element of feel  even for top football player  college football is also college  and that mean getting the family to sign on  too <BRK> the recruiting process is not just about the player  they can t recruit the player  they ve got to recruit the family   said jamal hill  who posed alongside his older brother  jeffrey  who got to wear oregon s neon green uniform a opposed to jamal s black one <BRK> it s a long term decision   hill added   you ve got to trust them  once you start recruiting the whole family  that make it go more smoothly  <BRK>during their campus visit  recruit typically tour not only football facility but academic one  coach are a likely to shoot the breeze a to draw x and o on a whiteboard  hoping to make recruit   and their family   feel like their college is a suitable home away from home <BRK>steve ognenovic   whose son nikolas  a tight end  posed alongside his father at pitt and kentucky before signing with the latter   recalled a long visit with auburn coach gu malzahn   we spent   minute talking about football   ognenovic said   the rest wa about the new addition on his deck  the truck he bought  he s a regular guy  <BRK>the trend can also be a way for coach to signal to recruit  present and future  what kind of program they are running  for instance  florida s second year head coach  dan mullen  appears intent on reintroducing to gainesville the kind of whimsy one expects from a team whose fan do a gator chop on game day <BRK>in contrast  a tennessee assistant coach recently spoke out against the practice  tweeting that one of the thing he prays for wa  that i never have to outfit someone s dad in full gear for a photo shoot   it is not shocking that the assistant first worked with tennessee s head coach  jeremy pruitt  when both were on the staff of alabama s supremely buttoned up nick saban  whose recruit are probably le likely to pose alongside mom or dad <BRK>so why do some kid and parent want these photograph  which may be compelling but are also a little bit absurd  and why do they make heavy rotation on social medium and in the sport blogosphere <BRK>the photo are a reminder of the human dimension in college football s annual meat market  for all the hoopla over which program ha signed the best class  spoiler  yet again  it will probably be alabama  and which team whiffed on a prized in state offensive lineman  often overlooked is how big a day this is for the prospect themselves  who  like so many other adolescent who are le gifted on the gridiron  are finally completing the large and much celebrated process of deciding where to go to college <BRK>steve snyder said that  when a missouri coach asked if he wanted to put a jersey on   i thought to myself  how many opportunity am i ever going to get to have an experience like this with my son  <BRK>his son ended up signing with baylor  and  snyder said  friend and family had already loaded up on bear gear   you re very proud parent   he said   lot of hard work  <BRK>doris burke contributed research <BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK>
