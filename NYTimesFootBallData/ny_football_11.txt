 <BRK>  <BRK> on pro football <BRK> by ken belson and kevin draper <BRK> the n f l  owner worried about a protracted legal fight  they fretted over potentially embarrasing disclosure  they were concerned about further alienating fan and sponsor  so they took the unusual step of reaching a settlement rather than continue to battle an adversary who wa viewed in some circle a a victim of the league s sharp elbow  <BRK> all of this happened nearly six year ago  when the league found it more expedient to pay hundred of million of dollar to retired player who contended the n f l  had concealed the danger of repeated hit to the head  among other thing  the   concussion settlement enabled the league to avoid the acute discomfort of battling in court with former player who had sustained neurological damage  <BRK> in many way  the n f l  followed this same road map on friday when it announced that it had reached another settlement  this time with the former san francisco  er quarterback colin kaepernick and his former teammate eric reid  they had accused the owner of colluding to keep them out of the league because they had knelt during the playing of  the star spangled banner  at game  an action that prompted other player to do so a well  <BRK> the n f l  ha a reputation for using a scorched earth legal strategy  and it decision to settle in both cae have been viewed some a admission of guilt  in fact  the league did not acknowledge wrongdoing in the concussion settlement  and it is not clear what it may have admitted to in friday s settlement because of a confidentiality agreement between the two side  <BRK> still  settling each time  the owner may have calculated that they and many fan could then try to move past the contentious issue at the heart of the two case   the long term effect of repeated head trauma in the first instance  and the right of player to protest in the second instance  <BRK>  there are broader issue than just money that the league considers   said matthew j  mitten  the director of the national sport law institute at marquette university   they need to take into account social issue and public perception   <BRK> the two case  in some way  are very different  one wa a class action lawsuit involving     retired player who sued in federal court  the other a grievance filed under the collective bargaining agreement  the league stood a chance of winning both case  had it persisted  but each case generated year of negative publicity  so the league  which earns    billion a year  wa in a position to spend money to make both case go away  <BRK> significantly  the two settlement provide the league with a measure of protection  mitten said  the concussion settlement precludes player in the future from suing the league for concussion related damage  and the settlement with kaepernick and reid avoided any adverse precedent being set  <BRK> kaepernick had not played a down since the end of    yet he continued to hover over the league  every time a backup quarterback wa signed  kaepernick s name wa invoked  if only to ask why he remained out of the league  <BRK> mark geragos  the lead attorney for kaepernick and reid  told cnn on saturday that he thought kaepernick would get a shot at an n f l  job now that the litigation wa over  <BRK>  i ll make the bold prediction  and you can save the tape   geragos told the network   i think you re going to see within the next two week that somebody s going to step up   he added   it would not surprise me if bob kraft make a move   referring to the owner of the new england patriot  who just won their sixth super bowl title  <BRK> geragos also mentioned the carolina panther  who signed reid a few week into the   seaon  a a potential landing spot for kaepernick  <BRK> geragos  who ha made similar prediction in the past  did not cite any source to back up his assertion  a patriot representative declined to comment  and the panther did not return a message requesting a response to geragos s remark  <BRK> still  even off the field  kaepernick ha loomed large  before the   season began  kaepernick persuaded the arbitrator in his case to dismiss the league s attempt to throw out his grievance  then he announced a lucrative endorsement deal with nike  which provides uniform to all   n f l  team  to add to the owner  discomfort  nike also made kaepernick a face of it  just do it  campaign  putting out a commercial narrated him during the opening game of the season  <BRK>  this ha been a p r  nightmare for the league  and in some sense  it s remarkable that kaepernick proved himself to be a larger public figure than the n f l  with his nike deal   said michael leroy  who teach sport law class at the university of illinois at urbana champaign   he outshined the league in a very significant way   <BRK> the presence of kaepernick  who rarely speaks in public  also hung over the super bowl this month  the basketball star lebron james and kevin durant were photographed wearing kaepernick jersey on super bowl weekend  the rapper common tweeted a photograph of himself alongside the longtime activist angela davis  who wa wearing a kaepernick jersey  and the filmmaker ava duvernay said on twitter that she wa boycotting the super bowl in support of kaepernick  <BRK> day before the game  the n f l  canceled it traditional news conference for the performer of the halftime show after report emerged that several prominent musician  in gesture of support for kaepernick  had turned down a chance to take part in the show  <BRK> the league also had to consider the arbitrator in kaepernick s case  player file dozen of grievance every season  but most are resolved without becoming public  kaepernick s case  though  wa being heard stephen b  burbank  the arbitrator who ruled in august that kaepernick s lawyer had gathered enough evidence for the case to proceed  <BRK> a university of pennsylvania law professor and an expert in contract law  burbank ha worked a an arbitrator for the league since   and ha a reputation for independence  he began his law career a a clerk for warren burger  then the chief justice of the united state  <BRK> one of his first tak for burger wa to proofread the monumental united state v  nixon ruling in   in which president nixon wa ordered to turn over tape recording and other material in connection with the watergate cae  more than   year later  burbank is wrestling with cae that may not be a historic but still carry plenty of significance  <BRK>  he told me once the main qualification of the job is not having any skin in the game   said stephen walter  a friend of burbank s who clerked with him on the supreme court   he isn t an n f l  fan of any sort  but he is the perfect guy for the job   <BRK> kaepernick and the league could have been encouraged and worried burbank s previous ruling a an arbitrator  over the year  he ha at time ruled for the player  a he did in a cae involving miscategorized ticket revenue  he ha also ruled for the league  a he did in a cae involving the circumvention of the salary cap  and in a cae involving revenue sharing  he ruled in part for the league and in part for the player  <BRK> reid filed his case in may  while he wa a free agent and wa drawing limited interest despite having just finished his best season statistically  the panther ultimately signed reid to a one year       million contract after the third week of the   season  and this week they gave him a more lucrative  three year extension  <BRK> reid missed only three game before joining the panther  and kaepernick ha been out of the league for two season  in that sense  the potential monetary damage reid could have won with a favorable ruling from the arbitrator were probably much le than kaepernick could have won  in any case  he ha settled  too  and the n f l  can try to move on  <BRK>  the n f l  ha so many other issue around player health and well being  they need to remove all the other static   said jodi balsam  a professor at brooklyn law school who worked a a lawyer for the n f l  <BRK> it is worth recalling that during the recent super bowl in atlanta  which took place le than two week before the league settled with kaepernick and reid  the n f l  invited  civil right leader to take part in the pregame coin toss  in doing so  the league wa embracing pioneer who helped bring social change to the country  and particularly to the south  but some wondered whether the n f l  wa also trying to counter the effect of kaepernick  whose principled protest continued to resonate  <BRK> now the league ha settled with kaepernick and with reid  still  if the concussion case is any indicator  merely settling will not make the issue that kaepernick raised simply go away  after all  nearly six year after the concussion settlement  the n f l  is still dogged story of former player in dire mental and physical health  and fear that football can cause brain damage have now reduced participation in youth football  <BRK> in the end  settlement  no matter what is at stake  can go only so far  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
