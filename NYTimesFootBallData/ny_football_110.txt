 <BRK>  <BRK> the ram and the chief were the darling of the league this season  but can they beat the saint and the patriot to get to the super bowl  <BRK> by benjamin hoffman <BRK> for all the excitement created the n f l  s offensive firework this season  the league could be accused of being predictable  from roughly week   forward  the ram  the saint and the chief were considered favorite to get to this point  and while it wa a down season for the patriot  relatively speaking  it will probably be several year after tom brady s retirement before people stop assuming he will find a way into the a f c  championship game  <BRK> so after all those yard and touchdown  it come down to the top four offense battling to reach the super bowl  four elite quarterback  four team with terrific running game and four head coach who seem more than capable of getting the most out of their player  <BRK> there will almost certainly be a great deal of scoring in both game  but the result could hinge on a key takeaway or a key pressure from one of the le heralded defense  and whichever team eke out a win will meet in atlanta two week later in super bowl liii   <BRK> here are our prediction for how the conference championship will sort out  both in term of who will win and who will win against the spread  <BRK> last week s record against the spread      <BRK> playoff record against the spread        <BRK> n f c  <BRK>     p m   fox <BRK> somehow the week   showdown between los angeles and new orleans did not receive the hype or the praise of the ram  thrilling win against kansa city in week    but it wa not for a lack of excitement or importance  the team combined for   point and   yard of offense  and the saint ended the ram  undefeated start to the season  <BRK> while that result essentially decided home field advantage for this game  and there are certainly apect of that game that could serve a a preview for this one  the ram  roster gained two important addition after that day  aqib talib and c j  anderson  <BRK> first and foremost is talib  the pro bowl cornerback who wa among the ram  most prominent acquisition last off season  he injured his ankle in week    had an operation and did not return until week    talib     immediately took the team s secondary from awful to adequate  <BRK> on top of that  los angeles ha gotten a boost in the lat three game from anderson  a running back who never quite reached his potential in denver  and spent this seaon on three team  he appears to have found a home a a second running option alongside todd gurley  helping spare gurley s balky knee from abuse and providing a different look at the position  <BRK> those addition level the playing field considerably  but there are plenty of reason the saint were the n f c  s top team in the regular season  and all of them hold true  quarterback drew brees is still firing on all cylinder  the team s running game is among the best   and the most versatile   in the entire n f l  michael thomas is among the game s most talented wide receiver  and the new orleans defense doe a terrific job of stopping the run  <BRK> in what should be a fantastic game between evenly matched team  the deciding factor could be which overmatched secondary performs better  there will be a lot of yardage regardless  but if talib can limit thomas  the opportunity is there for the ram to come away with a road upset and their first trip to the super bowl since the   season  <BRK> pick to win  ram <BRK> pick against the spread  ram      <BRK> a f c  <BRK>     p m   cbs <BRK> tom brady and the rest of the patriot seem to believe that the football world ha lost faith in them  it s true that many people picked the charger to win last week   though the patriot were officially   point favorite in the game   but even the most ardent believer in los angeles s chance seemed aware that the combination of brady  bill belichick and foxborough could easily lead to a win for new england   <BRK> fat forward one week  and the patriot are underdog not just in spirit but also in reality against a team that spent most of the seaon with people asuming it would reach the super bowl  the faith in quarterback patrick mahomes came quickly  but it wa also warranted  a he followed his     yard    touchdown regular seaon eaily dispatching the indianapolis colt in his playoff debut lat weekend  <BRK> when the patriot and chief met in week    mahomes had about a much success a a visiting young starter could expect in new england  throwing for   yard and four touchdown  but he also threw a pair of interception and endured the first loss of his professional career   <BRK> of concern to the patriot  however  is that mahomes seemed to be figuring thing out against them a the game went along  kansa city outscored new england       in the second half of that game  and mahomes tied the score with just over three minute to play hitting tyreek hill for a   yard touchdown   only to have brady march his team downfield for a game winning    yard field goal a time expired  <BRK> now the chief get a turn to host  and arrowhead stadium should be nice and frigid  with temperature expected to be in the low  s  last weekend  in the chief  win over indianapolis  coach andy reid compensated for the snow and cold focusing on the run  and it worked  four kansa city player scored rushing touchdown  the defense did it part harassing colt quarterback andrew luck into a poor game  <BRK> this time  the chief may want to focus on the pa  new england is vulnerable there  having allowed     paing yard this seaon and   touchdown through the air  though the damage wa mitigated a decent number of interception  a mahomes ha proved repeatedly  he can take chance while still minimizing turnover risk  and if he can turn this game into a shootout  he ha the advantage  thanks to his team s superior skill player  <BRK> this all add up to kansa city s rightly being the favorite  with an extremely good shot of playing in the super bowl for the first time since len dawson led the chief to a win over the viking in super bowl iv  brady ha every right to feel confident in his chance  based on the fact that thing virtually always work out for him and his team  chief fan have every right to be worried  based on their franchise s playoff history  but if mahomes is mahomes  that will be enough to warrant la vega s faith in kansa city   <BRK> pick to win  chief <BRK> pick against the spread  chief     <BRK> benjamin hoffman is a senior staff editor and regular
