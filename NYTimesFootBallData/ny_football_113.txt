<BRK><BRK>by the associated press<BRK>new york   just a he had the true touch when he threw pases  set record and won two super bowl  peyton manning ha the right approach when looking at some of the nfl s greatest moment <BRK>espn  nfl film and the league itself clearly felt that way <BRK>manning  a lock for the pro football hall of fame when he becomes eligible in    is hosting and serving a an executive producer for  peyton s place   a five part    episode series celebrating the nfl s  th seaon  the show debut on espn  in july  with espn and abc airing special compilation <BRK>for the quarterback  it wa a labor of love  a journey into pro football s past that wa educational  humorous and heartfelt <BRK> nfl film ha been great throughout this and they approached me about doing it to tell the story of the past   year   manning say   they certainly had a template and blueprint they wanted to tell  and we had certain people we wanted to talk to and visit and have conversation about how football got started  <BRK>so manning dived all the way back to ralph hay s hupmobile showroom in canton  ohio  he spent time with member of the undefeated   dolphin  rewatched super bowl   with joe namath  discussed the immaculate reception with steelers and raider to get the pittsburgh and oakland viewpoint  and discovered intriguing connection to the nfl for richard nixon  jay leno and elvis <BRK> we got to go down memory lane   manning say   i have always loved the history of the game and i have learned a lot during this journey  and spent some time with some of my favorite player and contemporary of my dad  former saint star quarterback archie manning  and guy he looked up to <BRK> nfl film ha all this great archive of  bear founder  george halas talking about being in ralph hay s hupmobile showroom   giant owner  wellington mara talking about how vince lombardi wanted him to take polaroid and throw them down to the field when vince wa coaching with the giant  to maybe re enact it or kind of tell that story  it s kind of why i signed up for it  <BRK>along the way  manning channeled his inner comedian  a displayed in tv commercial and a host of  saturday night live  <BRK>a big fan of elvis presley  manning visited graceland and  may or may not  have dressed up in an elvis costume  he did discover that presley staged impromptu game at local park and wa such a die hard nfl fan he had three television set on hand so he could watch a much football a possible <BRK> he got the idea from lyndon baines johnson  who had three tv so he could watch the news and political news coverage   manning explains <BRK>manning and cris carter also tried to replicate a stunt the new york giant performed at the o keeffe radiator building in manhattan   now the american radiator building  in    the giant  lynn bomar threw a ball to the ground from   foot up on the   story building  and hinkey haines caught it <BRK> back in the   s  the forward pas wa like a circus act   manning say   when you were in the red zone and threw a pas into the end zone and it wa incomplete  the other team got the ball  that wa news to me  clearly  team didn t want to throw it <BRK> but to get some buzz and interest with the team not drawing well  the giant did this publicity stunt and had  bomar  throw a pas off the building  so i threw a pas down to cris carter at the same spot and he caught it  it wa pretty neat  <BRK>also neat  no doubt  wa having manning service motorist s car at the vince lombardi travel plaza on the new jersey turnpike  manning dressed up a an attendant and  would give them a lecture or seminar on vince lombardi  while they were gasing up  the customer were given    off their bill if they could correctly answer question about lombardi <BRK>paying homage to one of the nfl s great qbs  sammy baugh  who also played safety and wa an all pro punter  manning had deion sander  try to teach me  to play defensive back   that provided some challenge   manning say with a chuckle <BRK>he visited with jay leno  a renowned clasic car collector  to discus the hupmobile  an auto on which several future nfl franchise owner sat  on the running board   drinking prohibition beer  a the league wa formed <BRK> i hope people who love football will find it entertaining   he say   i certainly have not been afraid to make fun of myself  <BRK>the fun of the series is accompanied a reverence for the history of his sport  such highlight a sitting with roger staubach and watching the long pas to drew pearson that spawned the  hail mary  description of such play  or chatting with jim brown about his career   in football and lacrosse and acting  or researching the role of bert bell  the league s second commissioner who created the draft  scheduled game for sunday   college football  more popular in the those day  owned saturday   and insisted on blackout when television became a factor <BRK> bert bell made a bad investment  putting his money in a pro football team  guy in leather helmet running into each other   manning say with a sarcastic laugh   bert bell wa a pioneer  <BRK>bell and nixon likely wouldn t have gotten along  nixon  a manning discovered  wa so annoyed he couldn t watch the redskin  home game from the white house during his     administration that he aked nfl commissioner pete rozelle to lift the blackout <BRK> rozelle refused  saying it would hurt attendance   manning say   so  basically  nixon got congress to pas a law to end the blackout  he called it one of the greatest achievement of his administration  and that show you how important it wa to people who wanted to watch their team  and still is  <BRK>___<BRK><BRK>
