<BRK><BRK>eagle    bear  <BRK>by ben shpigel<BRK>chicago   eleven month have elapsed since philadelphia s improbable super bowl title  and on sunday it wa ever more necessary to re establish this interval a fact  the playoff  again  had arrived  and there  again  wa nick foles  reprising his role a the eagle  backup turned starter turned savior <BRK>so  to clarify for anyone squinting at their television and wondering how foles managed to bend time and space  no  he did not actually depart one stadium in the midwest after bewitching his opponent and then materialize in another to do the same   though such confusion would be understandable <BRK>foles  and the eagle  seem to inhabit a place untouched the mayhem churning all around them  their mojo ha been so good for the last month that on sunday they foiled the league s most destructive defense with a go ahead touchdown on fourth down and then watched a kick that would have doomed them clang first off the left upright and then bounce off the crossbar <BRK>the final score   philadelphia    chicago     silenced the crowd at soldier field  which hosted it first playoff game in eight year  but not the occupant of the visitor  sideline  who danced and shouted and swarmed the grass after cody parkey s   yard attempt ricocheted to the ground  ushering the eagle into a divisional round matchup next sunday afternoon at top seeded new orleans <BRK>when the eagle  locker room opened to the news medium  music wa blaring and some player were huddled  watching replay of the kick  chris long turned to his fellow defensive end brandon graham  sitting beside him  and said   it s a hard job being a kicker   graham said   i know  boy   above the din  tight end zach ertz bellowed   club dub   referencing the dance party that raged after bear victory this season  all   of them  no strobe light pulsing in the home locker room sunday  only the harsh glare of the camera <BRK> you can t make this up   parkey said   i feel terrible  <BRK>a parkey s kick sank to the earth  the bear  macot  staley da bear  perched beneath the crossbar  fell over  the camera panned to chicago coach matt nagy  who did not blink  his mouth agape <BRK>in retrospect  the bear  biggest blunder of the season came last week  when they beat the viking in the last week of the regular season  by winning in minnesota   where the eagle captured their first super bowl  it should be noted   the bear granted philadelphia s entry into the postseason <BRK>chicago s reward  after going     to capture the n f c  north and the conference s third seed  wa to face the reigning champion  who barged into the playoff winning five of their final six game   the last three behind foles  in relief  again  of an injured carson wentz  the eagle have a quirky  if enviable  quarterback situation   the franchise star in wentz and the beloved backup in foles  who merely secured philadelphia s first football championhip since   <BRK>since acending to the starting job in week   at los angeles   where wentz injured his knee lat seaon   foles  unlikely to return to philadelphia next seaon  ha approached every game knowing it could be his lat in an eagle uniform  he tamed the ram  then the texan and the redskin  but had not yet encountered a defense a dominant a chicago s <BRK>just how dominant  the bear were the only team this season with more interception     than touchdown pass allowed     <BRK>even after chicago added two more interception sunday   after the first   minute  he had been picked off more time than in his previous four playoff game combined   foles remained at peace <BRK> what i ve learned on these stage   foles said   is just how to calm myself in a chaotic moment  <BRK>he simplifies  he gaze at   player he trust in the huddle  he call the play  with   minute   second remaining and trailing      philadelphia took over at it   and in the huddle foles simplified  gazed  trusted   and found alshon jeffery for   yard  he guided the eagle to the bear     converting a third and   to jeffery  before three straight play backfired <BRK>before fourth and their season  coach doug pederson signaled timeout  expecting the bear to blitz  pederson called a play that would move the pocket for foles  who rolled to his right and sidearmed a toss to golden tate  who caught it on the goal line and spun into the end zone with   second left <BRK>the moment reminded foles of his first playoff game with the eagle  at home five year ago against new orleans back in his first stint with philadelphia  he threw a late go ahead touchdown pas in that game   and then saw darren sproles  now his teammate  gash them with a long kickoff return that positioned the saint for the winning field goal <BRK>and on sunday  after philadelphia missed the   point conversion  foles  who completed   of   pass for   yard  watched tarik cohen ran back the ensuing kickoff   yard <BRK> that definitely came into my mind a little bit   foles said of the new orleans game <BRK>mitch trubisky  whose   yard touchdown pa to allen robinson with     left had put the bear ahead      directed the bear to the eagle     where parkey meaured his fourth attempt of the day  his travail this seaon have unnerved bear fan  who sulked a he missed   kick   seven field goal and three extra point <BRK>he drilled his initial try  but philadelphia had called timeout before the kick to ice him  the second bounced off the yellow post and onto the turf <BRK>when it wa noted to pederson at a news conference last week that foles had not lost the last two december  and beyond   pederson banged the wooden lectern for  you know  luck  that wa superfluous  he oversees a team that trampled favored new england in the super bowl  that ha coalesced after a     defeat nov    in new orleans  that outclassed the league s top defense on the road <BRK>the same eagle group that donned dog mak lat postseaon   at once lampooning their perceived underdog status and welcoming it   ha birthed a new wearable gimmick  ski mak  a if robber  they started stealing the ball  then they started stealing win  then they stole a playoff berth  then they stole victory from the bear <BRK>ask the eagle  and they say are not done  they have been down a similar path before  and found a trophy at the end  new orleans  beware <BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK>
