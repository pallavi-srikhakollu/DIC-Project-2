doncater belle used to be woman s soccer royalty  champion of england and a fixture in the f a  cup final  now  a investment flood into the woman s game  a new history is being written without them  <BRK>creditcreditandrew testa for the new york time<BRK><BRK>by rory smith<BRK>rossington  england   over the year  sheila edmunds ha done pretty much everything for the doncaster belle  half a century ago  she wa among the group of friend who founded the club  for   year  she wore the team s no    jersey and  for a while  it captain s armband <BRK>when she retired  she filled in wherever required  welfare officer  first aid practitioner  physiotherapist  now her official title is president and general manager  if that sound like an executive role  an honorary sinecure  it is not <BRK>an hour or so before a game at the windswept stadium that the belle now call home  edmunds can be found in the simple wooden cabin that pas for a ticket office  at her back is an electric heater  on futile full blat to stave off the bitter cold  she welcome fan handing over the    entrance fee warmly  a if each one is an old friend <BRK>in quiet moment  she might help out at the trestle table that serf a the belle  merchandising arm  after kickoff  she keep one eye on the game a she total up the day s taking  it is eaier this way  she say  she is the one  after all  who will have to enter it all into the club s account later <BRK>there is more money in woman s soccer in england than there ha ever been  last summer  the country s highest tier   the woman s super league  w s l     became  for the first time  fully professional  with a broadcasting arrangement with the bbc  england s biggest club  including manchester city  chelsea and arsenal  all have invested heavily in their woman s team in recent year  spending not just on homegrown player but for high profile import  too  manchester united  even  ha finally joined the fray  it launched it woman s team  in the second tier championship  last year  and immediately set about recruiting an all star roster <BRK>the effect ha been seismic  not just in term of result   manchester city reached the champion league semifinal the last two season and england s national team finished third in the   woman s world cup   but in term of interest  too  more than     people attended last season s woman s f a  cup final  and two million more watched it live on television <BRK>little or none of that growth  though  ha found it way to doncaster  or  more accurately  rossington  a small village on the outskirt of the town  where doncaster rover belle play their home game in the third tier of english woman s soccer <BRK>crowd rarely number much more than a hundred here  there are no television camera  last summer  the club s biggest sponsor walked away  it income now doe not stretch far beyond the cash edmunds sifts through in front of that electric heater <BRK>and yet this is the team that ha  arguably  done more for woman s soccer in england than any other  a club that wa synonymous with the sport for decade  in the  s and early  s  long before the professional club showed any interest in woman s soccer  the belle were it pre eminent force <BRK>between   and    the belle reached   of   woman s f a  cup final  and won the trophy six time  the team won the first ever woman s national league title  in    and regained the crown in    it would finish a runner up seven time in the following year <BRK>back then  it player formed the backbone of the english national team   at one point  we had seven or eight player in the squad   said gillian coultard  who spent   year playing for the belle in the team s heyday  and picked up   appearance for england  for a long time  she wa one of five player to have made a century of appearance for her country  the others were bobby moore  bobby charlton  peter shilton and billy wright   it wa a good quiz question   she said <BRK>doncaster  of course  wa proud of the belle  a small  tight knit town on the edge of the south yorkshire coalfield  it is not a place that attracts much national attention  or frequently enjoys much sporting success  the belle changed that   we won so much   coultard said   the cup final were on television  we felt like we represented doncaster  and south yorkshire  we kept the town at the pinnacle  <BRK>edmunds remembers the club being asked to send representative to have  afternoon tea with the queen and prince philip  when they visited doncaster  the player were guest of honor at the town s mansion house  the ornate georgian home of the local authority  on several occasion <BRK> we never had any sexist stuff   she said   south yorkshire people aren t like that  it s the sort of place where they acknowledge what people can do  they get behind you  there wa a real pride at what we achieved  <BRK>there wa broader  cultural recognition  too  the writer pete davy spent a year with the team in the early  s  his subsequent book   i lost my heart to the belle   coupled with the club s success  made the name famous  the playwright kay mellor used the book a source material for  playing the field   a bbc drama that ran for five seaons in the  s <BRK>to many  at a time when woman s soccer received scant investment and commanded little attention  the belle were the sport s most prominent face   they were the epitome of woman s football   said mike blackham  like most of the people who go to watch the belle now  blackham and his wife  jane  have a personal connection to the club  a friend play for the first team <BRK>that is testament to how the club s horizon have retracted in recent year  a the fortune of woman s soccer have risen  those of the belle have ebbed   the woman s game ha changed   edmunds said   it is more financially driven  we have been left behind a little bit  <BRK>in    when the football asociation  the sport s governing body in britain  expanded the woman s super league to two division  doncater belle were demoted to the second tier and manchester city s woman s team   far younger but  crucially  aligned with a premier league behemoth   were promoted in their stead  vic akers  then the manager of arsenal lady  described the decision a  morally scandalous  <BRK>doncaster wa promoted back to the top flight in    but lasted only a season before being relegated again  it won the second division last year  it first trophy since    but did not take up it place in the top tier  the f a  had changed the licensing criterion  and the belle   lacking a headline sponsor and a major men s team to bankroll the club   could not meet the new requirement   financially  we could not do it   edmunds said <BRK>all but two member of the championship winning side departed  many for manchester united s new woman s team  neil redfearn  the manager  left for liverpool  the belle decided against using the keepmoat stadium  the neat  modern venue that is home to doncater rover  the men s team with which they have a mostly symbolic alliance  and set up instead in rossington  where the two stand are little more than a few step covered a roof  smaller surroundings  edmunds said  would not be a  daunting  for the young player that now comprised the team <BRK>in doncaster  the belle  fame endures  and so doe the affection and esteem in which they are held  edmunds  for example  is well known enough in the town that  a few year ago  when she wa awarded an honor in london for her contribution to sport  the local paper afforded her the ultimate accolade  it referred to her only her first name <BRK>blackham  who coach a local junior team  find that while young boy dream of premier league stardom  the girl tend to have a different ambition   they don t talk about playing for manchester city or chelsea or arsenal   he said   they want to play for the belle  <BRK>there is some regret at the club s diminished status    the demise of it is very sad  because it wa so unique   said coultard   but there is no resentment of the game s authority  no lingering anger at the football association for failing to curate the most famous woman s team of all   that era ha gone   edmunds said   we do not want people to forget that history  because so many people put so much into it  but we do not dwell on it  <BRK>instead  she said  she take satisfaction in seeing all of the player who came through the club s rank who have gone on to play professionally  to play in europe  to play for their country <BRK>the golden age of the belle may have come and gone  edmunds said  but the club still ha a role to play   you look at those player and think we must be doing something right   she said   we still contribute  there is real pride in that  <BRK>those belle may be wearing different jersey now  playing for different club  but they still bear the stamp of the club she helped to create  they all add a little more sheen to the legacy  in edmunds s eye  they are still belle   that s what we have always said   she said  turning back to the day s taking   once a belle  always a belle  <BRK>rory smith is the chief soccer correspondent  based in manchester  england  he cover
