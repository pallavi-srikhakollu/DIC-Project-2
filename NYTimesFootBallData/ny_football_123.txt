<BRK><BRK>by benjamin hoffman<BRK>a the n f l  officially turned it calendar to the   seaon on wednesday  football in new york found itelf dramatically revamped  odell beckham jr   the outrageous wide receiver  wa no longer with the giant  and le veon bell  the ultra versatile running back  had agreed to a deal with the jet <BRK>those move qualified a the headliner of the league s off seaon movement so far  but a number of team have already made grand attempt to rework their roster <BRK>coming off a two year stretch in which the brown went      they improved to       in   and the team blossomed in the second half  trying to keep that momentum  cleveland traded for beckham  who is arguably the league s most talented wide receiver  he and his former lousiana state university teammate jarvis landry will most likely become one of the most productive wide receiver duo in the n f l   helping to unlock the enormous potential of quarterback baker mayfield in an offense designed freddie kitchen  the team s first year head coach <BRK>the brown  not content to improve just on offense  added two impressive player on the defensive line in sheldon richardson and olivier vernon  richardson  who ha reportedly agreed to a three year deal with      million in guaranteed money  will solidify the interior of the line  while vernon  who wa acquired in a trade with the giant for guard kevin zeitler  will provide an edge rusher to complement myles garrett <BRK>giving up zeitler  a talented but expensive lineman  to acquire vernon wa a significant cost  but the brown still seem greatly improved <BRK>bell ha a chance to be something truly special for the jet  he is a dynamic back unlike any the team ha seen since curtis martin  and bell come over on a deal that is nowhere near a rich a what the   year old running back had hoped for when his salary stalemate with pittsburgh began lat year <BRK>if the team had just added bell   and relied on improvement from quarterback sam darnold in his second year   the jet could have expected a bump up from last year s     record  but the jet apparently have also traded for kelechi osemele  a pro bowl guard  and agreed to contract term with the pro bowl linebacker c j  mosley and the reliable young receiver jamison crowder  who will probably play out of the slot  the transaction have been reported multiple news outlet but not yet announced the team <BRK>the jet had a long way to go to get back to respectability  but their new coach  adam gase  is about to have a lot more talent on his roster than he did a week ago  and after gaining bell in what should still be his prime  the jet have an opportunity to be a contender in the near future if they keep building <BRK>lat year the raider repeatedly denied that they were tanking for draft position  even a they traded the outstanding khalil mack and amari cooper for draft pick  regardless of their motivation in those move  they are clearly trying to build now  the team fleeced pittsburgh in a deal for antonio brown  the star wide receiver  in which the raider gave up just two mid round pick  in move the team ha yet to officially announce  they have reportedly invested a great deal of money in the free agent trent brown  tyrell williams and lamarcus joyner <BRK>whether or not these other move make the raider appreciably better is an open question <BRK>trent brown  who just won a super bowl with new england  is a mammoth left tackle    foot   inch    pound   he reportedly got      million in guaranteed money from oakland  but other than lat seaon  he had been considered mostly a disappointment  joyner  who wa reportedly guaranteed      million  blossomed under wade phillips s direction lat year with the ram but ha had an uneven career  and williams  who wa a good vertical threat a the no    wide receiver for the charger  will need to up his production if he want to serve a a proper complement to brown <BRK>the bill did a lot  some of the team s acquisition are fairly minor   running back frank gore    in may and entering his  th season  is inspiring but unlikely to cause a huge impact  but it will be worth watching how the addition of the free agent wide receiver john brown and cole beasley affect second year quarterback josh allen <BRK>allen  a ha been well documented  love to throw deep  and brown  who wa comically underutilized in baltimore once lamar jackson took over at quarterback  is one of the fleetest vertical threat in the game  with brown a the no    receiver and bealey in the slot  all buffalo need is for zay jones or robert foster to develop into a reliable no    receiver and allen  who creates more disruption with his running than some might asume  will be able to truly chuck the ball <BRK>in terrible news for the writing room of nbc s  the good place   jacksonville moved on from blake bortles  a quarterback who occasionally shined on the team s path to the a f c  championship game two year ago but struggled last season  in his place  the jaguar added the far more reliable nick foles  who went from contemplating retirement during the   season to winning a super bowl two year later <BRK>foles  whose deal includes more than    million in guarantee  is hardly a sure thing to live up to his contract  he ha had period of dramatic ebb and flow and ha not started more than   game in a season at any point in his seven season career <BRK>of more concern for jacksonville is the loss of both malik jackson and tashaun gipson on defense  the team released both veteran for salary cap reason  and with foles now on the book  it is questionable if the jaguar will be able to afford contract extension for other defensive star like jalen ramsey and yannick ngakoue <BRK><BRK><BRK>
