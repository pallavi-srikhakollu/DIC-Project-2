<BRK><BRK>super bowl liii<BRK>from the colt toppling the texan to the pas interference noncall heard  round the world  the lead up to this year s super bowl had no shortage of drama <BRK>by benjamin hoffman<BRK>illustration chris morris<BRK>this will be a week of hearing about sean mcvay and tom brady and sean mcvay and bill belichick and  if there s time  sean mcvay  but before we get to all of that  we should take a look at how we ended up with the los angeles ram and the new england patriot facing off in super bowl liii  there were twist and turn during the playoff  there were mistake  there were penalty  there were upset  and there wa a whole lot of fun <BRK>after three year of injury  disappointment and frustration  it would have been easy to give up on colt quarterback andrew luck  at     and finally healthy   he marched his plucky young team into houston and crushed the a f c  south champion  luck made it look easy  and in sharp contrast to the last few year  he made it look fun <BRK>the only thing standing in the way of dak prescott s first playoff win wa  well  several defender  the nuance and artistry of the   seaon were briefly abandoned a the   pound prescott morphed from quarterback to bulldozer  fighting his way through a crowd on a third and   play late in the game to set up the cowboy  victory sealing touchdown <BRK>every superhero ha a weakness  and the baltimore rookie lamar jackson  even a he redefined how often a quarterback can run  had shown one  ball security  the charger  with fresh memory of a regular seaon loss to the raven  crafted a defensive scheme around running down jackson and knocking the ball loose  and  much to the raven  chagrin  it worked to perfection <BRK>five second aren t a lot of time  but on cody parkey s attempt at a   yard game winning field goal  five second were enough for philadelphia s treyvon hester to get a hand on the ball  for the ball to ricochet off the left upright  for the ball to then bounce off the crossbar  and for chicago s hope of a deep playoff run led it championship caliber defense to fade into nothing <BRK>everyone said the chief were all offense and no defense  try explaining that to andrew luck  who had kansa city defender in his face for the entire   minute   second he managed to keep his offense on the field in this divisional round game  luck wa sacked three time and hit six more  and he also lost a fumble  spending the day mostly a a chilly spectator to the patrick mahomes show <BRK>c j  anderson had stint with carolina  oakland and los angeles this season  but the ram  backup running back added a fourth bench to his collection when he punctuated one of his many long run taking a seat on the sideline with his dallas counterpart  he and todd gurley beat dallas at it own game  running the cowboy into submission <BRK>charger quarterback philip river ha done most everything a player can do on a football field  he ha thrown   touchdown pass and won   regular season game  he ha survived injury  he ha adapted to change in the game  and he most likely ha earned a bust in canton  but he ha never beaten tom brady  and at this point it seems that he never will <BRK>if alshon jeffery had caught the ball  the eagle could have won the game  if he had knocked it down  they would have had a chance  unfortunately for the eagle  and their fan  belief that quarterback nick foles can always find a way  the ball sailed through jeffery s hand and into the waiting grasp of the saint  marshon lattimore <BRK>it is a noncall that will live in infamy  drew brees threw a pas toward tommylee lewis  and if lewis caught it  new orleans could milk the clock and kick a game winning field goal  out of desperation  nickell robey coleman  a defensive back for the ram  threw himself at lewis  arriving far too early and knocking the saint receiver out of the ball s path  it wa fairly obvious in real time that it wa a penalty  and painfully so on myriad replay  but the official somehow missed it  and in a sport routinely consumed replay  pas interference remains  for now  one of the few decision that cannot be reviewed  the saint officially lost in overtime  but they had the win stolen from them in regulation <BRK>patrick mahomes found his footing in the second half  turning a     deficit at halftime into a     tie at the end of regulation  he made impossible pass  stepped out of sack and showed every bit of the talent that made him the talk of the n f l  all season  but the league s overtime rule can be cruel  and kansa city s fate wa essentially decided the flip of a coin  the patriot won the right to receive the ball  and tom brady quietly marched his team down the field for a winning touchdown  mahomes  the player who can seemingly do anything he want on the field  wa left on the sideline in a jacket  witnessing his team s defeat <BRK>an earlier version of this article incorrectly described the patriot  winning touchdown against kansa city  it came on a running play  not a pas <BRK>benjamin hoffman is a senior staff editor and regular contributor to the keeping score column in sport  he joined the time in      benhoffmannyt   facebook
