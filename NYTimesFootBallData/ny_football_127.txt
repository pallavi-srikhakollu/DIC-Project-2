 <BRK>  <BRK> patriot    ram   <BRK> by ben shpigel <BRK> atlanta   the new england patriot  dynasty began exactly   year ago sunday  when the most fruitful partnership in n f l  history launched it transformation from plucky upstart to league overlord  coach bill belichick tamed the explosive ram  and quarterback tom brady commanded an efficient offense  <BRK> the patriot commemorated the anniversary securing another championship against the same franchise  in a similar way  for a title that represents not a bookend so much a an ellipsis  new england s reign is a relentless a a downpour  and without precedent  <BRK> the patriot claimed their sixth title in   season edging the los angeles ram       in a slog of a super bowl liii  <BRK>  how the patriot stifled the ram  drive drive   <BRK> like their previous five super bowl victory under belichick and brady  sunday s wa not decided until late  on sony michel s   yard touchdown run with seven minute left  <BRK> one final stop   stephon gilmore s interception near the goal line with   minute   second remaining   punctuated a defensive effort that evoked belichick s first masterpiece against the ram  when he sapped their potency erasing the versatile back marshall faulk  against this ram team  the league s second ranked offense  new england forced punt on nine of   possession and five three and out  <BRK> the patriot  performance will ricochet around their empire a belichick s magnum opus  but it will be remembered outside new england a a grind  lacking the offensive artistry that defined this record setting seaon  <BRK> we fly you through the scene of two pivotal super bowl play  <BRK> it wa a if after all the mark shattered   the most touchdown scored  the most touchdown pases thrown   the ball decided  in the  th and final game  that it wa just too exhausted to breach the end zone anymore  it did so only once  <BRK> these ram and patriot will be forever linked in super bowl ignominy  the fewest combined point  the lowest scoring first half in   year    point   the most time elapsed without a touchdown  that stretch ended at the time when brady asserts his primacy  <BRK> all of brady s other championship have come after the score wa tied  or the patriot were trailing  in the fourth quarter  in those situation  brady wa   for   with   yard and three touchdown and no interception  taking over at his   yard line with     left  brady connected on four straight pass for   yard  including a   yard beauty to rob gronkowski down the left side that preceded michel s touchdown  his sixth of the playoff  <BRK>  i ll tell you this   gronkowski said   it wa the most satisfying year i ve ever been a part of  how we came together  the obstacle we had to overcome  the grind from the beginning of training camp to now  it s just surreal   <BRK> brady  at age    finished   of   for   yard  with more than half of that total       going to julian edelman  a year after missing the patriot  super bowl loss to philadelphia with a knee injury and being suspended for the first four game of this seaon for violating the n f l  s policy on performance enhancing drug  edelman wa selected a the game s most valuable player  <BRK>  he just played the best game he ha all year   brady said  <BRK> in a league designed for parity  brady and belichick have destroyed it  together  they have made nine super bowl  including the last three  the miami dolphin  from      and buffalo bill  from      accomplished that feat before the patriot  but neither had new england s staying power  <BRK> only one other franchise ha won six super bowl  and it took the pittsburgh steelers   year to collect their lombardi trophy  the patriot needed half a long  <BRK>  we ve never seen the like of it  we ll never see it again   ever   the super bowl winning coach brian billick said last week   the league s just not structured that way   <BRK> the patriot  infrastructure   owned  coached and quarterbacked the same men during this run   and ruthless roster manipulation give them a chance every season to extend the dynasty  rarely  though  is that pathway linear  <BRK> belichick s charge this seaon  a always  wa to discern the identity of this team instead of recreating that of another one  the patriot  quest for self discovery meandered through a pair of two game losing streak  three double digit defeat and five road setback until  in late december  after falling at pittsburgh  they found equilibrium  <BRK> complementing quick pasing with power running  new england averaged     on the ground across it lat five game  that approach powered the patriot pat two a f c  west behemoth  the charger and the chief  and on sunday it helped them gah the ram for   yard    from michel  the lesson  a ever  the patriot are not vulnerable so much a they are procratinators  evolving before they can pounce  <BRK> back when brady won his first super bowl  sean mcvay wa a   year old sophomore at the marist school    mile to the north of mercedes benz stadium  he is now  at    the youngest coach in the n f l   hired the ram two year ago  after they finished their first seaon back in los angeles a a bumbling mess  and taked with shaping a winning team and energizing a fan bae  <BRK> one of mcvay s many aphorism   sean ism  a they re called   is  the standard is the standard   the ram won consecutive division title  but a they gazed across the field sunday they saw the personification of that standard  a team whose sustained success they hoped to emulate  <BRK> ram quarterback jared goff grew up watching brady  like him a son of northern california  while mcvay exchange text message with belichick  the mastermind outwitted the prodigy  and mcvay knew it  blaming his play calling and an absent feel for the game s flow  <BRK>  there s no other way to say it   mcvay said   i got out coached tonight   <BRK> mcvay surrounded himself with sharp assistant  including the defensive coordinator wade philip  who  when scheming against a quarterback like brady  abides a singular credo  <BRK>  you can t fool the great quarterback  anyway   he said   you have to outplay them   <BRK> in the a f c  championship game three year ago  when phillips led the bronco  defense  denver s pas rush pummeled brady all game  brady s protection in the playoff had been so good entering the super bowl     dropbacks  no sack  according to pro football focus   that he posted to his instagram story a photo of his jersey  white and pristine  and tagged his offensive linemen  <BRK> early on  the ram  coverage and pressure discombobulated new england  on his first pas  brady s wobbly throw wa deflected  and then intercepted cory littleton  on the patriot  next drive  they called two timeouts before stephen gostkowski hooked a   yard field goal  missing a kick in the super bowl for the third consecutive year  on the series after that  john franklin myers strip sacked brady  but new england recovered the fumble  <BRK> in a matchup of two of the n f l  s four highest scoring team  nearly   minute elapsed before gostkowski scored the game s first point  on a   yarder with     left before halftime  the patriot      lead   which signified the fewest first half point scored in a super bowl since pittsburgh led minnesota       in     did not seem insurmountable  but it did increase the likelihood that belichick  aided the defensive play caller brian flores  again had concocted a strategy to foil a prolific offense in the super bowl   flores     is expected to become the coach of the miami dolphin this week   <BRK> a belichick did against the   bill  when he worked for the giant  and the   falcon  who did not score for the final   minute of regulation and overtime  he silenced the ram like no other team since mcvay took over  <BRK> patriot linebacker kyle van noy said the defense wa focused on taking goff  just    out of the game  <BRK>  i think we felt if we stopped the run and put it into his hand  it played in our advantage   van noy said  <BRK> in   previous game under mcvay  the ram had never been held scoreless at halftime  on sunday they gained   yard  their fewest in a first half this seaon   or   fewer than edelman  who shredded the ram on underneath route  los angeles advanced only a far a the new england   yard line  punting on all six drive  <BRK> that meant johnny hekker punted more time than goff completed pass  five  or the ram recorded first down  two   <BRK>  i think you re just numb in a way   goff said   we re trying to process it all  but we know what happened  we got outplayed  we got completely outplayed   <BRK> after los angeles opened the second half with  yes  two more punt  goff connected on his two best throw to that point   a   yarder to brandin cook and  on third and   from the new england    an   yard dart over the middle to robert wood  three play later  greg zuerlein drilled a   yarder that evened the score at      <BRK> the score stayed tied until michel s touchdown  and los angeles had one last  best opportunity to equalize  on second down from the patriot     just after duron harmon swooped in to break up a deep pas to cook  goff looked that way again  this time  his pas wa underthrown  and gilmore  draping cook  leapt to grab it  <BRK>  i knew jared goff wa going to chuck it up   gilmore said   it wa probably one of the easiest pick i ve had all year   <BRK> gostkowski extended the margin of victory with a   yarder with     left  and after zuerlein missed a   yarder  a final act of desperation  the patriot swarmed the field  the scene familiar and new all at once  <BRK> they have assembled this unyielding dynasty behind gronkowski and edelman  devin mccourty and dont a hightower  and hundred of others  but only two men have witnessed it all from the start  neither brady nor belichick ha indicated he intends to retire  and why would they  the everlasting champion  for the sixth time in   season  have a title to defend  <BRK> an earlier version of a summary that appeared with this article on the time s home screen referred incorrectly to a record shared the new england patriot and the pittsburgh steelers  the team have each won six super bowl title  not six n f l  title  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
