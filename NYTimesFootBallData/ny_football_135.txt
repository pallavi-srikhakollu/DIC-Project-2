 <BRK>  <BRK> the texan  cowboy  raven and bear are all favorite at home  but there may be some upset lurking  look out for the colt  <BRK> by benjamin hoffman <BRK> it wa a race to the finish for team like the colt  the raven and the eagle  but there is no time to celebrate a they all now have to back up their n f l  playoff position trying to beat fierce competition  the weekend s wild card matchup will be spread over two day  with a trip to the divisional round on the line  <BRK>  read  tarik cohen make football fun again in chicago  <BRK> here are our prediction for how the game will sort out  both in term of who will win and who will win against the spread  <BRK> last week s record against the spread      <BRK> final regular season record        <BRK>     p m  saturday  espn and abc <BRK> from   to    only three team started the season     and made the playoff  this season s texan       not only accomplished that feat  but  entering week    they were also in contention to have the best record in the a f c  <BRK> the turnaround is nothing short of remarkable  it is a testament to the quality of the team s defense and the star power of it quarterback  deshaun watson  and no    wide receiver  deandre hopkins  but to join the   san diego charger a the only team since   to win a playoff game after starting      the texan will have to get through indianapolis  which had a worse start to overcome       <BRK> the colt       were     after their terrible start  joining the   kansa city chief a the only team since   to make the playoff after such a poor start  and they did it with quality play all over the field  finishing with the n f l  s fifth ranked scoring offense and it  th ranked scoring defense  <BRK> indianapolis won on the road in houston in week    ending the texan  nine game winning streak  thanks to an outrageous effort from t y  hilton  who had   receiving yard  after that game  hilton wa not shy about his ability to succeed at houston s nrg stadium  <BRK>  this is my second home  man   hilton said with a laugh   this is my second home  i don t know  every time i come here  i just go off  i don t know what it is   <BRK> hilton wasn t wrong  in his seven career trip to houston  he ha averaged   yard a game and scored seven touchdown while the colt have gone       <BRK> indianapolis also benefit from a fully operational andrew luck  who went from three year of battling shoulder woe to attempting a career high   pass this season     of which went for touchdown  the team ha an emerging star at running back in marlon mack  and a touchdown machine at tight end in eric ebron  and it defense got a breakout year from the rookie linebacker darius leonard  who wa snubbed from the pro bowl but managed an n f l  leading   tackle to go with seven sack  two interception and two fumble recovery  <BRK> the colt don t typically travel well  but houston seems to bring out the best in them  they should have the upper hand on saturday  <BRK> pick to win  colt <BRK> pick against the spread  colt      <BRK>      p m  saturday  fox <BRK> ezekiel elliott won his second rushing title this season   in just his third year in the n f l    despite sitting out week    a dominant running back  he expects to shoulder the load for the cowboy       in the playoff  so the rest wa welcome  <BRK>  just knowing that we re going into these playoff  i m going to have the highest workload i probably had all season   elliott told reporter   <BRK> since dallas wa     in the seven game that elliott carried the ball   or more time this season  and the seahawks       allowed an ugly     yard a carry from opposing running back  keeping the ball in elliott s hand is probably a good strategy   <BRK> with elliott  dak prescott and amari cooper all carrying the offense at different time this season  it s easy to see why so many people focus on that side of the ball  but the cowboy are in the playoff largely because of a defense that ha been retooled into something formidable   <BRK> it allowed the sixth fewest point in the n f l   wa the no    rushing defense  and while the secondary gave up more yard than it would have preferred  it became a far more formidable unit with the help of kris richard  a defensive back coach who wa one of the architect of seattle s legion of boom defense  <BRK> seattle probably deserved more attention for it play this seaon than it received  largely written off in the preseaon a a team that had reached the end of it contention window  the seahawks eaily qualified for the playoff for the sixth time in seven seaons  <BRK> linebacker bobby wagner is still among the game s best defensive player  and russell wilson managed to let the offense become more run focused while still throwing   touchdown pas  and  a always  the seahawks were a true force to be reckoned with at home  but this game is in dalla  and expecting a team that wa     on the road to win there seems unrealistic   <BRK> pick to win  cowboy <BRK> pick against the spread  cowboy    <BRK>     p m  sunday  cbs <BRK> with lamar jackson at quarterback  the raven       were so dominant running the ball that the total of   yard they managed in a week   win over the charger       wa actually the team s low point   <BRK> it is a style of play that would be more typical of the  s than today s n f l   but the raven  run first approach under jackson led to a     finish to the regular season  with a series of opponent walking away wondering what just hit them   including the charger  who lost to baltimore at home       <BRK>  keeping score  philip river doesn t need a ring to be great  <BRK>  we couldn t get them off the field on defense   charger coach anthony lynn said after the game   and we couldn t stay on the field on offense  we got outplayed  we got outcoached  it s just that simple   <BRK> it is hard to figure out what wa more dominant once jackson took over  baltimore s running game  which generated     yard in seven game  or it run defense  which allowed     <BRK> now the charger get a second crack against them  and while slowing jackson and gu edward is probably unlikely  los angeles can at least hope to generate more than the   point it managed at home in week    <BRK> there is some room to pa against the raven   patrick mahomes and baker mayfield each threw for more than   yard against them in the seaon s second half   but the charger should proceed with caution a baltimore generated   turnover in it final six game  <BRK> the charger had a terrific season  which taken in totality wa more impressive than baltimore s  but unless they figure something out based on the film of their fairly humiliating loss two week ago  quarterback philip river may have his season end early once again  <BRK> pick to win  raven <BRK> pick against the spread  raven      <BRK>     p m  sunday  nbc <BRK> the eagle       weren t even supposed to make the playoff after they fell to     and lost quarterback carson wentz to a serious back injury  now they enter wild card weekend on a three game winning streak  hoping they can recreate the success of lat seaon  when they entered each playoff game a an underdog and still won the super bowl  <BRK> it is a great story regardless of how it turn out  and the backup quarterback nick foles deserves a great deal of credit for revitalizing an offense that had often looked stagnant under wentz  this time around  the eagle appear to be underdog not just in name  but also in term of overall talent compared with the bear        <BRK> chicago rode it suffocating defense and a good enough offense to the third best record in the n f c   and it formula of forcing turnover and running the ball tends to play well once january roll around   <BRK> the eagle might not have to contend with chicago s best defensive back  eddie jackson  who is questionable with an ankle injury  but the bear still have plenty of defender who should give foles nightmare  including khalil mack  akiem hick and kyle fuller   <BRK> chicago s offense is not nearly a advanced a it defense  mitchell trubisky is a tentative paser  but jordan howard and tarik cohen have the ability to grind game out on the ground  because the defense score so much on it own  the bear finished with the ninth most point in the n f l  despite being ranked  st in total yard   <BRK> by no mean should philadelphia be written off in this game  a the eagle have a championship winning defense in place and an offense that is on a hot streak  but beating one of the top team in the n f l   on the road  is likely out of the eagle  reach  <BRK> pick to win  bear <BRK> pick against the spread  eagle    <BRK> kansa city  new england  new orleans  los angeles  ram  <BRK> all time are eastern  <BRK> benjamin hoffman is a
