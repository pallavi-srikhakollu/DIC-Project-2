dollar in appearance fee  subsidized travel and bonus for each point earned  the champion could take home a prize of more than    million  cordeiro ha invited the south american to a meeting to discus the proposal next week in miami  <BRK> the proposed   team tournament would resemble  in structure though most likely not in name  the   copa américa centenario  that tournament  a relocated version of the south american championship   expanded to celebrate the event s  th anniversary   brought the   member of the south american confederation  conmebol  to the united state for a month to face off not only against one another  but also a half dozen opponent from concacaf  the regional confederation made up of north and central america and the caribbean  <BRK> that tournament wa considered a sporting and   perhaps more important   a financial success  and wa won chile  which beat argentina in a penalty kick shootout in the final in east rutherford  n j  the new event would take place in june and july next year  <BRK> the proposed   tournament would again include all   south american team  plus six from concacaf  and would most likely feature a group stage and then a knockout round to determine a champion  u s  soccer s role in the offer  and concacaf s consent  would be critical to making the event happen  since both would have to approve any plan to hold such an event in the united state  <BRK> concacaf releaed a statement tuesday night acknowledging receipt of cordeiro s overture and expressing support for it broad stroke   we view this opportunity positively a it is not

state  the event could fill a gap in the global soccer calendar   at the moment  the euro are the only major championship scheduled for that summer   but despite the million being offered  it is unclear how south american and conmebol official will react to a tournament that would conflict with their copa américa plan  <BRK> the copa américa ha included guest team for year  mexico and the united state have participated in it several time  and this year it will include japan and qatar  <BRK> for the united state  though  the event could have several positive  fifa is expected to choose the dozen or so host city for the   world cup in the next two year  so the tournament could be a chance for the   finalist to make their cae for inclusion  it also would offer meaningful competition for the united state men s national team a it head into qualifying for the   world cup  that process began later than hoped because the search for the team s head coach  gregg berhalter  wa delayed  first the world cup bid and then the search for a general manager to run the national team program  hired in december  berhalter ha coached only two friendly to date a he prepares for this summer s gold cup  <BRK> if the proposed tournament with conmebol doe not come to fruition  u s  soccer could still press ahead with a new event  possibly a scaled down tournament involving team from other continent  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
