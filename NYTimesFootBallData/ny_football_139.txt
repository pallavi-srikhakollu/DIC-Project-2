<BRK><BRK>by reuters<BRK>the nfl s schedule release is like christmas morning    that is  if after unwrapping all of your gift  you sat and stared at them for       month before unboxing the good <BRK>with wednesday night s unveiling  we can finally start circling the calendar  counting the day and drooling over the best   battle to come <BRK>you don t need me to tell you to watch the rematch of last season s conference championship    saint at ram in week    chief at patriot in week      but here are a few others you absolutely should not miss <BRK>   patriot at eagle    week    sunday  nov   <BRK>not only is this a rematch of super bowl lii  a battle of the last two super bowl winner and the first meeting between tom brady and carson wentz  but it s also the next installment of a very strange head to head history <BRK>these team have faced each other just   time total  with two of those coming in the super bowl  the five meeting since   have pitted brady against five different quarterback  with very odd result <BRK>brady outlated donovan mcnabb in super bowl xxxix but needed a fourth quarter rally to keep   s perfect seaon alive against a j  feeley  of all people  the patriot rallied from a     deficit to beat vince young     and the  dream team  eagle in    then blew a     lead at home to sam bradford  chip kelly   co  in    a philadelphia scored three non offensive touchdown <BRK>of course  nick foles   co  won super bowl lii    which featured the most combined yard       in a game in nfl history    despite brady throwing for   yard and the patriot never punting <BRK>the star power at quarterback is reason enough to watch  the possibility of something strange happening only make it more fascinating <BRK>   colt at chief    week    sunday night  oct   <BRK>this game is a rematch from january s divisional playoff  let s also hope it s the second of many installment in a patrick mahomes v  andrew luck rivalry <BRK>when father time eventually ousts brady in a   round split decision  not only will there be a superstar vacuum to fill  but the battle for afc supremacy will be more open than it s been in two decade  these two quarterback  ahem     baker mayfield and deshaun watson also would like a word  are the most likely future ruler of the conference  we can only hope mahomes v  luck becomes a rivalry half a historic a manning v  brady <BRK>a for meeting no     the colt should be awfully dangerous  luck is further removed from his lost   seaon  and a coaching staff that wa duct taped together on the fly lat january  thanks  josh mcdaniels  ha had another year to jell after an outstanding debut seaon  with former chief pas rusher justin houston aboard and chris ballard s war chest of draft pick  indy s defense should make major stride under rising coordinator matt eberflus <BRK>the chief  meanwhile  have a ton to prove despite an excellent   campaign  almost no offense that reached the level they did last season ha been able to sustain it year after year  while the defense lost dee ford and eric berry in addition to houston <BRK>   ram at brown    week    sunday night  sept   <BRK>this will be the brown  first time hosting a non thursday night prime time game since    and their first time hosting a sunday night game since    amazingly      <BRK>it s easy to forget because they ve had so little to cheer for in age  but cleveland fan are among the most devoted in football  with the brown  expectation suddenly pointing skyward  firstenergy stadium will be electric when the reigning nfc champion come to town <BRK>freddie kitchen and mayfield will try to break down wade phillips  scheme while hoping joel bitonio   co  can hold up long enough against reigning two time defensive player of the year aaron donald  on the back end  the team that tried to trade for odell beckham jr  last offseason will be tasked with slowing him down  likely with heavy dos of aqib talib and marcus peter <BRK>meanwhile  steve wilks  defense face one of it toughest test of the seaon against sean mcvay  a freakish young star myles garrett battle crafty veteran left tackle andrew whitworth to get to jared goff <BRK>   cowboy at saint    week    sunday night  sept   <BRK>this might not be everyone s cup of tea  but last year s thursday night meeting in week   at dallas wa like a bar room brawl you couldn t turn away from  the cowboy  defense  led blossoming star linebacker jaylon smith and leighton vander esch  battered the previously red hot saint offense and delivered the first major blow to drew brees  mvp candidacy <BRK>new orleans getting robbed of a super bowl liii appearance overshadowed a suspect finishing stretch from brees  who averaged just     yard per attempt with seven touchdown and five interception from week   through the postseason  no one is arguing he s washed up  but when the end arrives for quarterback  it doe so swiftly and with little warning <BRK>jared cook give brees his most dynamic tight end since jimmy graham wa traded in    but trusted center max unger retired  and mark ingram is also gone  the week   rematch with dallas  defense should be an excellent barometer for where brees stand early in his  th nfl season <BRK>   viking at chief    week    sunday  nov   <BRK>it s easy to overlook minnesota after   went sideways  but the viking still have one of the nfl s best roster  if they can piece together a respectable offensive line  they could be a juggernaut <BRK>most fascinating in this battle is the clash of andy reid s offense and mike zimmer s defense  zimmer s unit dictate term to opposing offense more than any other nfl defense  using a terrifying front four  finely tuned coverage rotation and a litany of blitz to punish opposing quarterback <BRK>but trying to dictate to the chief  offense is dangerous because reid ha so many answer  he routinely creates six  and even five man box to run against through spread formation and packaged play  he also feast on zone coverage getting tyreek hill inside against linebacker and safety <BRK>there should be firework against zimmer s aggressive  flat footed zone  but harrison smith   co  should also force mahomes into a few turnover <BRK>  david dechant  field level medium<BRK><BRK>
