super bowl liii<BRK>at    mcvay will be the youngest head coach in super bowl history  to put it mildly  the rest of the n f l  ha noticed <BRK>coach sean mcvay ha gone a combined     in his first two season with the los angeles ram creditcreditkirby lee usa today sport  via reuters<BRK><BRK>by benjamin hoffman<BRK>atlanta   mozart wa composing music at    sergey karjakin became a chess grandmater at    blaise pacal invented the mechanical calculator a a teenager  and sean mcvay led the los angeles ram to the super bowl at   <BRK>one of those four doe not really qualify a a prodigy  but that ha not stopped virtually everyone in the football world from throwing the word around in the lat few week in reference to mcvay  a second year head coach who ha become the toat of the n f l  in the lead up to super bowl liii <BRK>a with most thing super bowl related  mcvay a prodigy is a narrative born of something true and then expanded to an uncomfortable degree  <BRK>the rush to replicate mcvay s success began in earnest in january  when a league of team that have often relied on retread coach and established hierarchy suddenly wa in need of it next boy genius <BRK>the green bay packer created a mcvay coaching tree  of sort  hiring his former offensive coordinator  matt lafleur  who is    to be their head coach  the cleveland brown hired freddie kitchen  a   year old offensive guru  to lead their staff  and in an extreme example of mcvay mania  the arizona cardinal  website  in it official announcement about the hiring of the   year old kliff kingsbury a the team s new head coach  noted that kingsbury wa friend with mcvay  <BRK>that the two had never coached together seemed not to matter  though after some blowback  the team amended the announcement to remove the part about their friendship while still noting that mcvay is a young  offensive genius who ha become the blueprint of many of the new coaching hire around the n f l   and had recently offered kingsbury a chance to join the ram a an offensive consultant <BRK> it s certainly humbling and flattering   mcvay said of the hiring trend   but i think more than anything it s a reflection of the success the ram have had  <BRK>in the end  team may discover that replicating mcvay will be difficult <BRK>young  offensive minded coach are  the vogue thing right now   said brian billick  the former baltimore raven coach   some will be successful  and some won t  eighty percent will probably fail   <BRK>very few coach have engineered the kind of turnaround that the ram have made in two season under mcvay  who  despite having coached in the n f l  since    is younger than one of his player  and two of the patriot <BRK>he began his head coaching career taking the ram from a     record with a league low average of   point a game in   to     with a league leading average of     point in    then mcvay proved that wa no fluke improving a bit more this season  to     with an average of     point a game <BRK>mcvay  who ha already become a master of coaching catchphrase and clich√©s  ha regularly tried to expand the spotlight to the other coach around him  he frequently us the phrase  we  not me  to describe his team s approach <BRK> one of the thing that s so important is surrounding yourself with great people   he said   specifically in those other area where they have leadership role  <BRK>his call for inclusiveness extends to coach of all age  his first hire for the ram wa wade phillips  a   year old defensive coordinator who had been coaching in the n f l  for   year when mcvay wa born  <BRK>phillips said he wa somewhat familiar with mcvay  then the offensive coordinator of the wahington redskin  before his hiring  but that it wa a call from phillips s son  wes  who had replaced mcvay a wahington s tight end coach  that set the whole thing in motion  wes phillips aked his father if he would be interested in joining a mcvay staff should the opportunity arise <BRK> i said   you know he s   year old  you think he s going to get one    wade phillips said on thursday   he said   dad  if he interview for one  he s going to get it   <BRK>he added that the first call from mcvay wa straightforward   he said   would you interested in going with me if i got a job   and i said   yeah  sure   <BRK>but even with the phillips hiring serving a a nod to his elder  mcvay seems content to play up his own youthfulness  short and fit n f l  coaching standard and naturally baby faced  he spike his hair up with product and trim his beard into a perfect   o clock shadow <BRK>he talk glowingly about watching tom brady win the   super bowl   when mcvay wa     and revel in getting congratulatory text message from patriot coach bill belichick  who is twice his age <BRK>and in what served a the perfect visual for the n f l  s only millennial head coach  a video circulated recently in which ted rath  a ram asistant  repeatedly pulled mcvay out of the way of official on the sideline  with the whole thing set to music  mcvay is hardly the only coach to have a spotter charged with making sure he is out of the way  but the coach s seeming obliviousness to rath s maneuver created a scene that  depending on your age  reflected either a lack of situational awareness or a remarkable ability to focus <BRK>when mcvay signed on to become head coach of the ram  he wa   year   month old  which made him the youngest person in that role in the n f l  since    when art lewis  at    wa hired the cleveland ram  a team that would eventually move to los angeles  then to st  louis  and then back to los angeles  <BRK>before mcvay  the youngest n f l  head coach of the modern era wa lane kiffin  who wa hired the oakland raider at   year   month old  and then fired   month later   and the youngest head coach to lead his team to a super bowl wa mike tomlin of the pittsburgh steelers  who wa    for an idea of how unusual it is for coach to reach the league s pinnacle that early  the previous seven super bowl have been won coach who were   and older <BRK>billick is one of the few people who can relate to mcvay s experience of being the n f l  s hot new thing  hired to coach the raven in    after coordinating a minnesota viking offense that averaged an eye popping     point a game  billick turned the hype into result winning a super bowl in his second season  a feat mcvay could match on sunday <BRK>billick called mcvay a brilliant coach  praising his ability to change up look at the line of scrimmage  but he could not quite stop himself from diluting the praise pointing out that there is relatively little difference between the offense mcvay run and the one employed belichick and new england s offensive coordinator  josh mcdaniels <BRK>mcdaniels also took a turn a the n f l  s coveted young coach  ten year ago  he left the patriot at   to become the denver bronco  head coach  a job he lost   game into his second seaon  <BRK>the similarity between him and mcvay led to an amusing scene on monday involving a reporter and mcdaniels <BRK> everyone continues to talk about sean mcvay and his young mind  and they seem to have forgotten about you   the reporter said before asking   what kind of advice do you have for him  <BRK>mcdaniels  who is still just    clearly had anticipated question about mcvay  even one a harshly worded a that  he jumped right in with praise <BRK> there s nothing you can say about what sean s done that s not in some way shape or form a superlative   mcdaniels said   he s pretty special  i think we need to appreciate him for what he is and who he is and what he s done at an early age  <BRK>the grandson of john mcvay  who wa a giant head coach and an executive who helped shape the dynastic san francisco  er of the  s and  s  sean mcvay wa a star quarterback in high school   he wa named georgia s  a offensive player of the year over calvin johnson in     but a transition to wide receiver at miami univerity did not lead to any professional opportunity <BRK>his first stop in the n f l  wa a an asistant wide receiver coach for the tampa bay buccaneer in    he worked under jon gruden and gruden s younger brother  jay  who wa an offensive asistant  aide from his grandfather  mcvay said  those two men have had the largest impact on his career <BRK> jon gruden taught me the foundation of what i know about this game   he said   took me under his arm  taught me to see it from a big picture perspective  <BRK>mcvay went on to coach tight end for the redskin  and eventually worked again for jay gruden  who became washington s head coach in    he promptly promoted mcvay  at    to offensive coordinator <BRK>after developing kirk cousin a a quarterback  mcvay wa hired the ram to revamp their moribund franchise  <BRK>in the announcement of mcvay s hiring  stan kroenke  the ram  owner  set the bar extremely high for success <BRK> we are confident in his vision to make this team a consistent winner   kroenke said   and we will all continue to work together to achieve our ultimate goal   bringing a ram super bowl championship home to los angeles  <BRK>come sunday  mcvay will either be the youngest head coach to win a super bowl or the youngest head coach to lose one  but regardless of whether you want to call him a prodigy  an offensive guru  or simply a coach  mcvay will have to watch his back  in a copycat league  some other team can always go younger <BRK>naila jean meyers contributed reporting <BRK>benjamin hoffman is a senior staff editor and regular contributor to the keeping score
