 <BRK>  <BRK> on pro football <BRK> by ken belson <BRK> roger goodell began his tenure a commissioner of the n f l  in   declaring that disciplining the league s     player for their transgression would be a priority  true to his word  the number of suspension and fine rose  and it remains high relative to what it wa  <BRK> disciplining owner  though  ha been more complicated  a with player  the n f l  constitution give the league commissioner broad authority to penalize owner for  conduct detrimental to the welfare of the league or professional football   <BRK> but while the player essentially work for goodell  and have little leverage to influence his decision  goodell work for the owner  and those owner include robert k  kraft of the super bowl champion new england patriot  <BRK> kraft     wa charged on friday with two count of soliciting sex a part of a wide ranging investigation into prostitution and human trafficking in florida  the police in jupiter  fla   used video surveillance that showed kraft inside a masage parlor that  the police said  wa used for selling sex  <BRK> in a statement  the patriot  categorically deny that mr  kraft engaged in any illegal activity   <BRK> however the cae is resolved  the episode is an embarrasment to a league that like to portray itelf a a pillar of moral rectitude but that ha struggled to shake an image that it player  employee and owner treat woman poorly  <BRK> the league ha been rocked a host of domestic violence scandal  cheerleader have detailed how they were exploited their team  last year  jerry richardson  the former owner of the carolina panther  wa fined      million after an investigation confirmed claim that for year he sexually harassed employee  <BRK> now this  <BRK> if kraft is found to have committed a crime  even a misdemeanor  goodell will be under pressure to penalize him to compensate for the embarrassment the league ha suffered  how he treat the matter will provide an illustration of the dynamic of power at the highest rank of the league and show the length he will go to appear to treat player and owner equally before the expiration of the current labor deal two year from now  <BRK> kraft may be the league s most successful owner  his franchise ha won six super bowl title since the   seaon  a a key figure in negotiating labor deal and broadcat contract  he may also be the league s most powerful one  he is also a confidant of the commissioner  close with the leader of the league s medium partner and the league s go between with president trump  <BRK> that said  the n f l  includes it share of misfit and wayward son  and from time to time  the patriarch  or  in this case  the commissioner  ha to dole out justice  how much justice often depends on the stature of the owner  the offense he or she committed and any past transgression  <BRK> some case are straightforward  when edward j  debartolo jr   the former owner of the san francisco  er  pleaded guilty for failing to report a felony arising from a gambling fraud and extortion case  few were surprised when the commissioner at the time  paul tagliabue  fined him    million and suspended him for the   season  <BRK> jim irsay  the owner of the indianapolis colt  who ha a history of substance abuse  pleaded guilty to driving while impaired  and wa promptly suspended for six game and fined      for violating the league s personal conduct policy  <BRK> kraft s cae is more complicated  he wa charged with two misdemeanor  and those charge may be reduced or dropped a charge of soliciting a prostitute often are  kraft is not married  his wife  myra  died of cancer in    <BRK> hugh culverhouse jr   who wa involved in league matter when his father owned the tampa bay buccaneer and who practiced federal criminal law for   year  said goodell would most likely wait to see if the charge against kraft were dropped  and then might only issue a fine  <BRK> even so  he suggested kraft wa likely to be treated with kid glove because he is among the most powerful owner  kraft also sits on the compensation committee  which determines the size of goodell s paycheck  <BRK>  he essentially could be sanctioned for bad taste   culverhouse said   it will come down to embarrassment   <BRK> in a statement  the n f l  said it is  aware of the ongoing law enforcement matter and will continue to monitor development   <BRK> at the very least  the commissioner will have to appear not to have one set of rule for player and another for owner  there are difference  though  player penalty are negotiated the player  union and the league and included in the collective bargaining agreement  <BRK> the league s constitution say goodell can suspend or fine an owner  for no more than        or both  a suspended owner cannot go to the team s training facility or stadium  <BRK> if warranted  the commissioner can refer the matter to the entire group of owner  which can vote to impose additional penalty  <BRK> that is unlikely to happen in kraft s case  jodi balsam  who wa a lawyer at the n f l  and now teach at brooklyn law school  said the league often wait until legal case are resolved before penalty are assessed  prostitution case are often adjudicated quickly  she said  though this case will receive more scrutiny because it is part of a human trafficking investigation  <BRK>  if he is convicted  that would seem to bolster the case for commissioner discipline   she said  and  even if he escape criminal penalty  the league can conduct it own investigation and decide to penalize him   <BRK> goodell and the patriot have butted head before  over spygate  in which the patriot were found to be filming their opponent  sideline to steal signal  and deflategate  in which a league investigation determined it wa most likely that the team had deliberately deflated football in inclement weather so player could grip the ball better  <BRK> kraft didn t hide his anger about the penalty his organization received in those case  this one  of course  is different  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
