 <BRK>  <BRK> by the associated press <BRK> ole gunnar solskjaer ha spent much of his time a manchester united manager harking back to the club s trophy laden pat under alex ferguson  <BRK> now it s time to focus on the future   and he know it  <BRK> united s     aggregate loss to barcelona in the champion league quarterfinal highlighted just how far england s biggest club remains behind the best in europe  six year after ferguson s retirement  <BRK>  i ve said all along this isn t going to change overnight   solskjaer said   and the next few year are going to be massive for u to get to the level where barcelona and other team are at the moment   <BRK> the so called  new manager bounce  provided solskjaer s arrival in december a the replacement for jose mourinho maked the frailty that still existed in united s team  from   win   and only one loss   in his first   match in charge  when united arguably overperformed  solskjaer ha now presided over five loss in his lat seven game  <BRK> united is out of the champion league and might not get back into the competition next season after dropping to sixth place in the premier league  <BRK> so  the question are coming thick and fat  wa united haty in making solskjaer it permanent manager on the back of his successful three month a interim coach  how much doe united need to spend in the offseaon to build a squad capable for challenging for the big title  will paul pogba still be at united next seaon  doe united need a director of football  <BRK>  we ve got a rebuilding job   solskjaer said after the     loss to barcelona in the second leg on tuesday  <BRK> solskjaer <BRK> with his permanent smile and positive outlook  the norwegian coach ha been a breath of fresh air at united following the gloomy final month of the mourinho era  his regular and sentimental reference to the glory day under ferguson   in which he played a major part   endeared him even more to fan  <BRK> at first  he wa a caretaker manager but the clamor to hire him on a permanent basis became so intense that united s american ownership relented and gave him a three year deal on march    his result up to that point possibly merited it  but united could have waited until the end of the season  <BRK> united is currently on it worst run of result this seaon and some of solskjaer s selection are being scrutinized   for example  left back luke shaw playing a a left sided center back in the first leg against barcelona and center back victor lindelof a a right back in the second leg  many fan wonder why ahley young is still being picked  <BRK> solskjaer s favored counterattacking approach worked perfectly in united s hot streak  but the team often had little control  can he change his style of play to adapt to all type of game  <BRK> offseason target <BRK> the squad clearly need a shake up  especially in defense where the much criticized young continues to play a an out of position full back  center back chris smalling and phil jones are still there  too  eight year after being member of the united team that lost     to bael to get eliminated from the group stage of the champion league  <BRK> with ander herrera reportedly set to join paris saint germain  central midfield seems a problem area for solskjaer  too  brazil international fred ha struggled to make an impression in his first season in england after moving from shakhtar donetsk for about    million despite an improvement in recent week  and it may be asking too much for   year old scott mctominay to be a regular  <BRK> solskjaer also might want to strengthen the right wing  where jesse lingard is currently first choice  england international jadon sancho  who play for borussia dortmund  is one option under discussion  <BRK> can executive vice chairman ed woodward  whose record in the transfer market ha been widely criticized  and the relatively inexperienced solskjaer be trusted to get the right player in ahead of next season  <BRK> pogba s future <BRK> solskjaer s most important work this offseason might simply be keeping pogba at the club  especially if united doe not qualify for the champion league  <BRK> pogba ha been linked with a move to real madrid  where coach zinedine zidane ha spoken of his admiration for his compatriot and fellow world cup winning midfielder  solskjaer ha said he expects pogba to stay  but the situation could change if the club s record signing push for a transfer  <BRK> director of football <BRK> united ha lacked direction and strategy since ferguson s departure  particularly in it selection of coach and player  and the club is looking to hire a director of football   or sporting director   for the first time  <BRK> it will be a much needed appointment to modernize the structure at united  helping woodward   the man who is effectively running soccer operation at the club   in area such a recruitment  contract and other administrative matter  a well a providing a middleman between the board and the coaching staff  <BRK> various name have been mentioned in relation to the role but the search is ongoing  united need to make the appointment a soon a possible so solskjaer s offseaon planning can be accelerated  <BRK> ___ <BRK> ___ <BRK>  <BRK>
