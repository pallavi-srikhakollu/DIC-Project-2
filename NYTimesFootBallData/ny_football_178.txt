 <BRK>  <BRK> the ram were super bowl contender all season  but faith in the patriot turned sean mcvay s team into underdog  can los angeles pull off an upset against the five time champion  <BRK> by benjamin hoffman <BRK> this super bowl is a matchup of old and new  the   year old bill belichick will be coaching against the   year old sean mcvay  the   year old tom brady will be starting his ninth super bowl  while the   year old jared goff will play in his first  <BRK> a year after being upset in a super bowl that set an n f l  record for total yard  the patriot will be looking for a record tying sixth lombardi trophy  while the ram  having only recently moved back to los angeles  will be looking to earn the franchise s second  <BRK> kickoff      p m    television  cbs   streaming  free on cbssports com <BRK> there is more uncertainty to the ram  approach to this game than you would expect  and that uncertainty center on the readiness of running back todd gurley  <BRK> no single player ha benefited more from mcvay s tenure in los angeles than gurley   not even goff  gurley  a former georgia star  went from the verge of being called a bust for averaging an ugly     yard a carry in   to becoming perhaps the n f l  s most well rounded running back  <BRK> in   game under mcvay  gurley ha     yard from scrimmage and   touchdown  a lot of that is gurley s versatility a a runner and pas catcher  but he also benefit from a system in which play are cleverly disguised  gurley is surrounded a solid group of skill player  and that helped him face eight men in the box on only     percent of his carry this seaon  which wa the third lowest figure among qualified running back  according to the n f l  s next gen stats databae  <BRK> but gurley sustained some knee inflammation in week    that forced him to miss two game and most likely torpedoed his chance to be named the n f l  s most valuable player  the ram had to adjust on the fly in the playoff  relying a great deal on c j  anderson  a veteran backup who wa cut both the carolina panther and the oakland raider this season  <BRK> anderson  often running the ball with protection from two tight end  ha already far exceeded expectation  and in the divisional round  both he and gurley thrived  in the n f c  championship game  however  gurley essentially disappeared  blaming his lack of rep on his  sorry  play rather than his balky knee  <BRK> the patriot  disciplined approach doe not lead to a lot of mistake  so for los angeles to be productive on offense  it success will probably have to come in large part from the running game  that make gurley s health even more important  <BRK> belichick ha been known to focus his defense on eliminating the player he see a the biggest threat  but with the uncertainty surrounding gurley  the patriot could go in a different direction and work on shutting down the ram  top wide receiver  new england is intimately familiar with both of them  brandin cook played for the patriot lat seaon  and robert wood began his career in the a f c  eat playing for the buffalo bill  <BRK> the patriot  defense played with fire a bit this season  allowing an average of     yard a game  which wa  rd in the n f l  but they were able to prevent team from turning yard into point  allowing opponent just     point  which ranked seventh  that could be a very dangerous formula against los angeles when one considers both gurley and anderson s ability to punch the ball into the end zone  <BRK> in these playoff  the patriot have made a point of starting strong  they scored on their opening drive against the chief in the a f c  championship game  and on their first four possession against the charger in the divisional round  <BRK> new england s formula for success is not hard to decipher  but it ha proved mostly impossible to stop  it all center on moving remarkably fat  with tom brady alternating between short throw and handoff in an approach best described a death a thousand cut  <BRK> numerous time per game an opposing defense will appear to have new england stopped  only to have a swing pas to james white or a second effort julian edelman keep thing going  depending on one s perspective  it is either infuriating or inspiring  but either way it work  <BRK> the difference from lat seaon to this one are brady s having cooled off some in term of throwing the ball deep  that s largely a personnel issue rather than an indication that brady s arm ha aged  and the patriot  having developed sony michel  a rookie running back  into a player who would be an every down back on any team that didn t like to mix thing up a much a new england doe  <BRK> that familiar approach will be going up against a ram defense that produce a lot of game changing turnover but also ha a propensity for giving up huge amount of yard and point  wade phillips  the ram  defensive coordinator  ha often proven to have a magic touch  and he certainly ha a talented group of player  but there is a sense that they have yet to reach their potential  the unit s reliance on exploiting mistake could be an issue against an opponent not known for making them  <BRK> thanks to the extended rest  gurley should be ready to go  and that could make all the difference for los angeles  establishing his versatility early in the game will open up everything else and allow goff to get point on the scoreboard  that should keep the ram from falling into the same hole the chief and the charger did   <BRK> it is tempting to believe brady can keep up even if the game turn into a shootout  but aaron donald  the ram  standout defensive tackle  is perhaps the perfect disrupter for new england s offense  if donald can generate consistent pressure up the middle  forcing even mild mistake from brady  then mcvay  a coaching mind who ha already been hailed a the future of the n f l   would be ready to be crowned king of the league s present  the game will undoubtedly be close   the patriot always seem to make it close   but the ram should win  <BRK> ram      <BRK> benjamin hoffman is a senior staff editor and regular contributor to the
