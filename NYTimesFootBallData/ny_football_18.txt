 <BRK>  <BRK> the ethicist <BRK> by kwame anthony appiah <BRK> i have decided to stop watching football given the recent finding about the frequency with which concussion occur and the long term effect of those concussion on the player  i am not trying to take a stand and change any of my family s or friend  opinion  but i do want to feel like i m doing my part   <BRK> can i still follow my team in some way  though  i m a jet fan  o k   maybe i m not giving up much not watching   and i really like keeping up with their season  what involvement with the team would be ethical  can i read up on the team in the newspaper  what if i walk into a restaurant and a game is on television  is it o k  if i watch it there  after all  they ve chosen to play  and maybe i should respect that  name withheld <BRK> a body of research suggests that football cause long term brain damage in many player  still  a you point out  the player are in a position to decide for themselves whether they want to run the risk  those who do well in the sport expect to earn more money and more glory than they would in another endeavor  so you could just think this put the responsibility on them  if they re rational  they are  in effect  making the judgment that they are better off playing than not  even with a serious prospect of incurring chronic traumatic encephalopathy  c t e    not to mention other chronic injury and condition  <BRK> that s not the end of the discussion  though  when it come to exposing worker to hazard  our view aren t straightforward  bureau of labor statistic from   show     nonfatal injury among construction worker      injury among local law enforcement officer      injury among those for whom driving is part of their job  if you choose to be a roofer rather than a groundskeeper and accept a greater risk of injury for more pay  we re o k  with that  but the reason we have osha standard is that we think measure to abate hazard should be taken where feasible  the potential for grievous injury is surely part of why people watch nascar race  we still expect driver to use six point harness and flame retardant suit  <BRK> it isn t obvious how this principle should be applied to a game like football  some think that new high tech helmet will help  others argue that no helmet at all would be safer  because  a in rugby  it might discourage head collision  player spend much more time in practice than in actual game  and some think that practice need to be reformed to avoid the subconcussive impact that have been linked to c t e  there s more research to be done  more rethinking of the rule of the game  player who lower their head and initiate helmet contact can now be penalized  and maybe there s a way to expand that penalty category  the existing penalty can certainly be increaed and made more of a deterrent  shortening the preseaon could help  too  but if you really care about the welfare of football player  you should want not just to turn your back on bad practice but also to advocate for better one  <BRK> a utilitarian  who ass action their effect  would point out that nothing you re proposing to do contributes to that effort  you can avoid newspaper coverage or screen in sport bar  but given your refusal to urge anyone else to refrain from attending or watching game  that gesture will be undetectable to the football authority  not to mention sport journalist  and put no pressure on them   at least in picking the jet to follow you ve made it easier to skip every super bowl  from which fate seems to have decided they would be excluded for the past half century   <BRK> but again  that s not the end of the discussion  might there be a reason to shun a harmful activity even if doing so won t have beneficial effect  there are two line of argument to consider here  one associated with immanuel kant and the other with aristotle  a kantian test for assessing an action is to consider whether it flow from a principle that you d have reason to want everyone to follow  let s suppose everyone s boycotting football would lead to swift change to make the game much safer or even bring the sport to an end   here  the utilitarian would note that the end of football might lead to worse life for those who now play the game at all level and to the loss not just of a lot of pleasure among fan but also of job for commentator  stadium staff  official and the like   you can still wonder whether that kantian strategy of the universalized maxim matter if  in the real world  none of your sport fan friend are going to follow your lead  <BRK> one reason to refrain from fandom is simply that you may not want to be the sort of person who take pleasure in a game that is causing serious and unnecessary harm to it player  an approach to ethic that focus on what kind of person you are   so called virtue ethic   is often associated with aristotle  it tends to judge action in term of character  rather than the other way around  and you hear it echo in a familiar formula of reproval   what kind of person would        <BRK> let me offer a final consideration  in following the game  in joining the culture that sustains football  in it current form  a an american institution  you are not causing harm directly   but you are  in a sense  participating in causing harm  you ve been enlisted in a collective action that you view with disapproval  in this regard  you can be part of the problem  even if the problem would persist if you weren t  <BRK> my husband and i are struggling to conceive  we ve been seeing a fertility specialist and going through cycle of treatment  we started with oral medication  to which unfortunately i stopped responding  we have since moved on to injectable medication  if this doesn t work  we ll at some point have to start thinking about ivf   <BRK> though i desperately want to have a baby of our own  i m struggling with whether it is ethical to go through the rather incredible length to get pregnant that ivf requires when there are child who urgently need home  i know that the cost of adoption  and the difficulty of actually successfully adopting a baby  make it likely a emotionally grueling  and more expensive than  a an ivf cycle  still  the effort would go to providing a home for a baby who need one   <BRK> more pressing is the number of child in the foster care system  we ve talked about fostering child in the future  but in our mind that would occur after we d had some experience parenting  i do not feel that right now we could take on the enormous responsibility of foster care  i do feel we are ready for a baby of our own  child in foster care generally need a great deal more than a new baby doe  <BRK> the bottom line is this  though i want to have a biological child  and my husband definitely doe want to go to ivf if it come to that  i am struggling to wrap my head around going through so much intervention when we could instead take in a child who need a home   <BRK> am i off base here  or do we have a duty to give home to child who need them when we can t easily have child of our own  name withheld <BRK> taking on a child who already exists and need a home is an enormously worthy thing to do  if you re confident that you can bond with him or her and create a loving environment  but you don t have a duty to adopt one  there are many thing we each could do   such a being a parent to one of the hundred thousand or so foster child in this country who need a new family   that would improve the world  but morality doesn t demand that we do all the good we can  if you had a duty to adopt a foster child  it wouldn t be enormously worthy  just required  <BRK> plenty of couple want to conceive but would choose to have no child rather than adopt a foster child  that s essentially the position you re in  you don t feel prepared to provide foster care  it follows that a child you and your husband might have together wouldn t be depriving a foster child of a home  and you re not obliged to remain childless  <BRK> kwame anthony appiah teach philosophy at n y u  his book include  cosmopolitanism    the honor code  and  the
