 <BRK>  <BRK> patriot    charger   <BRK> by bill pennington <BRK> foxborough  mas    the essence of the new england patriot  reign a this century s most successful n f l  team ha been their peculiar capacity to feel smug and belittled at the same time  <BRK> it is a paradox the patriot have put to good use at pivotal time on the way to five super bowl victory  winning some game because of unbridled confidence and others because they believed they were being unfairly disparaged  <BRK> sunday s     thrashing of the los angeles charger in an a f c  divisional round playoff game   the patriot led   point at halftime   wa conspicuously in the latter category  after an uneven season in which new england stumbled through the final quarter of it schedule and many in the n f l  community prepared an obituary for this dynasty  the patriot had built up a fair amount of righteous indignation  <BRK> the result sunday wa a furious ambushing of the visiting charger  a talented team largely relegated to beingstanders a new england scored   unanswered point before halftime to put the game virtually out of reach  proof of the patriot  mind set for the afternoon came minute after the final whistle when quarterback tom brady stared into a television camera during an on field interview  <BRK>  i know everyone think we suck and can t win any game   he said   so we ll see   <BRK> asked to elaborate on his comment later  brady grinned  paused and added   i just like winning   <BRK> but he also had begun to brace for another week of feeling disrespected  the patriot will travel to kansa city to face the top seeded  high scoring chief in the a f c  championship game next weekend  <BRK> and they will be a pronounced underdog  <BRK>  yeah   brady said   we ll look forward to that   <BRK> indeed  they will  it is a rarity for a team competing in it eighth consecutive a f c  conference championship game to know it will be spending the week fending off score of question about the offensive might and superior skill set of the opposition  <BRK> but these patriot  always assured yet still vulnerable  said they are used to it  said tight end rob gronkowski   we ve been hearing that kind of stuff for year now  we laugh at it and keep moving forward   <BRK> however the patriot chief matchup is ultimately perceived and analyzed in the coming week  new england undoubtedly fired an eye catching warning shot across the bow of the remaining n f l  team chasing a super bowl victory  <BRK> the first indication that the patriot meant business sunday came at the pregame coin toss  coach bill belichick rarely elect to receive the opening kickoff when his team win the toss  this time  he did  <BRK> at that moment  the charger  despite all their success this season  should have known they were in trouble  <BRK> with surgeon like precision  brady completed   of his first   pas a the patriot scored touchdown on each of their first four possession  after one punt  they scored another touchdown  <BRK> while sunday s victory wa the patriot  ninth successive postseason win at gillette stadium  their utter dominance of the charger wa still somewhat surprising  los angeles s offense and defense each ranked in the n f l s top    just a week ago  the charger thoroughly manhandled a stout baltimore raven team in the wild card round  <BRK> but from the beginning sunday it wa clear the charger were not playing baltimore s one dimensional offense or it rookie quarterback  lamar jackson  <BRK> it wa also clear that brady  who appeared to be slowed a gimpy knee in the last quarter of the regular season  wa more rested and that new england offensive coordinator josh mcdaniels had devised an effective  multifaceted game plan to deal with the six  or seven defensive back zone defense the charger had used against the raven  <BRK> brady  who completed   of   pass on sunday for   yard  threw only short pass to his wide receiver and running back to start the game in a fast paced attack that had the charger reeling  the patriot    play opening drive concluded when running back sony michel rumbled into the end zone for a   yard touchdown  it wa the first of three first half touchdown for michel  who rushed for   yard  <BRK> one of brady s main target through the air wa julian edelman  who had nine reception for a team high   yard  <BRK> the charger tied the game in the first quarter on a   yard touchdown pas from quarterback philip river to keenan allen  but it proved to be the high water mark for los angeles  which rallied for three largely meaningless touchdown in the second half  <BRK> river ha never beaten brady in eight try during his career and defeated the patriot only once when brady wa injured  river is also now     against new england in the postseason  including a defeat in the a f c  championship game in    <BRK>  it wa an emotional week   just being back here after   year   said river  who completed   of   pass for   yard   it s tough  it take a long time to get back to the same spot  so it s certainly a disappointing finish   <BRK> a for the patriot  the vibe in their locker room after the game wa  not surprisingly  a little swagger and a little defiance  <BRK> the veteran wide receiver matthew slater made a sarcastic joke about how the patriot were  aging   asked what he really meant the remark  slater smiled and answered   that we ve still got a little left in the tank   <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
