rehydrate  regroup and reset for one final surge <BRK>a super bowl halftime unfurls like a slow drip  player sit at their stool for a few minute  they can breathe  and they can think  mindful of preserving energy without cooling down  coach convene for several minute compiling a checklist  assistant communicate correction and tactical adjustment  coordinator gather unit at the end of the room  trainer wield foam roller to smooth tight muscle  head coach emphasize point  official remind team when   minute remain  then five  then two <BRK> read about sean mcvay s rise to lead the ram to the super bowl  <BRK>a normal halftime unfolds a if caffeinated  player retape their joint  adjust their pad and change their undershirt and shoe  they down banana and orange slice  guzzle water and energy drink and huddle with coach  who  after hustling down elevator from their upstairs perch  make a small tweak or two and then  boom  off they go again  a if spectator and not participant  they debate whether they have enough time to use the restroom <BRK> you re out the door almost a fat a you come in   said matt light  an offensive tackle who played in five super bowl for new england <BRK>former patriot player said bill belichick  who is set to coach in his ninth super bowl with new england  describes the logistics of halftime ahead of the game in a much detail a he would a game plan  the clock start within   to   second of the team leaving the field  the halftime show  which begin after nine minute  lats about   and a half minute  about seven minute before kickoff  player begin filtering out to stretch and warm up <BRK> there s definitely never a time where we re just sitting there wondering what s going on   patriot receiver chris hogan said <BRK>belichick view the two half of a super bowl almost like a doubleheader  with a gap between game for player to recuperate mentally and physically  according to player and coach who have been through this with him   by now there are a lot of them   he reminds the player to hydrate and keep their emotion in check  sharing cautionary tale <BRK>the pregame festivity ahead of the super bowl are far longer than usual  too  and before the unbeaten   patriot lost to the giant in super bowl xlii  belichick told player how receiver troy brown once expended so much energy before one of their championship that he wa winded kickoff <BRK>a member of that team  receiver dont√© stallworth  had a history of muscle injury  and he thought it would be warm inside the stadium in arizona  hesitant to receive fluid intravenously    i really hate needle   he said   he suppressed his fear after randy moss  in colorful language  reminded him that he d be playing in the super bowl  the infusion helped to keep his muscle loose and pliant before the game  and then at halftime he placed heat pack under his leg to warm his hamstring <BRK>some team simulate the extended halftime taking   minute break in practice  it worked for the eagle last year  it didn t for the patriot seven year ago <BRK> i don t think you perfect it   said ivan fear  new england s running back coach since     i think you have an idea of how to handle it because we ve been there a few time  <BRK>in each of their two super bowl victory against new england  the giant followed the same comprehensive blueprint  the note for which jerry palmieri  the team s strength and conditioning coach at the time  ha kept  upon returning to the locker room  he said  player had but one responsibility <BRK> just chill   palmieri said in a telephone interview   we didn t come back to them  a coach  until   minute remained  <BRK>josh mcdaniels  the patriot  offensive coordinator  cautioned against overthinking a coach  just because there s more time  he said  doesn t mean they need to use it all <BRK>the ram  in their first super bowl under coach sean mcvay  chose to run special team period at specific juncture of practice so their offensive and defensive unit could rest  john fassel  the ram  special team coach  said he ha told the player on the coverage team to warm up their hamstring early if they wind up kicking off in the second half <BRK>given the ram  penchant for trickery  it s possible they will mimic one of the more famous gambit in super bowl history  when new orleans entered halftime trailing indianapolis       with the colt  guided peyton manning  slated to receive the second half kickoff  aaron kromer  who served on the saint  staff that year and now coordinate the ram  running game  said thursday that the team knew it had to steal a possession to defeat manning <BRK>and so  early in the break  coach sean payton informed kicker thomas morstead that instead of booting the ball deep  he d squib an onside kick  morstead told reporter afterward that he wa terrified  but new orleans recovered  scored a touchdown on that drive and eventually won <BRK>reggie wayne  a receiver on that colt team and now an analyst for nfl network  said he had been antsy during that halftime  knowing his team had the momentum <BRK> we were saying to each other  you know  in the locker room  if we go down and score on this drive  we ll kill  em  we can bury them  you know what i mean   he said   then they came out with the onside kick  so maybe we needed more time  <BRK>the additional time did help the patriot  trailing the atlanta falcon   point two year ago  in a specific way  they could refocus  from speaking with player  matt chatham  a three time super bowl winner with new england who is now an analyst for nesn  said he expected to hear that table were overturned  voice were raised and significant change made  instead  he said  he heard the opposite  there wa urgency  but there wa no rush <BRK> we jut went out and played a bad a we possibly could   said hogan  relaying belichick s message   let s play better and see where it put u  <BRK>new england s defense coalesced a tom brady dissected man to man coverage  atlanta  exhausted  collapsed  the patriot scored the final   point and won in overtime  they could all agree  it wa worth the wait <BRK>follow ben shpigel on twitter   benshpigel<BRK>naila
