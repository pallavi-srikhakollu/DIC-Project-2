<BRK><BRK>by scott cacciola<BRK>los angeles   c j  anderson ha accomplished a good deal a a running back in the n f l  he rushed for more than     yard lat seaon  he wa a pro bowl selection in    and a super bowl champion with the denver bronco  but the pat nine month have been a different experience for him altogether <BRK>since april  three team have released him  the bronco  the carolina panther and the oakland raider  who waived him in december without giving him a single carry  the raider  it should be noted  were atrocious this season <BRK> it s how you handle thing   anderson said   i always just kept my head down and kept pushing  <BRK>a new opportunity for him materialized lat month when the ram signed him a something of a stopgap meaure  todd gurley ii  their star running back  wa sidelined with a knee injury  and anderson suddenly found himself on the field for one of the best team in the league  so he took the ball and rumbled with it  and he ha been bulldozing defender ever since <BRK>on saturday night  anderson paired with gurley to form a punishing one two running attack a the ram advanced to the n f c  championship game with a     victory over the dalla cowboy  anderson rushed for   yard on   carry  and gurley finished with   yard on   carry  they also combined for three touchdown  and whomever the ram face next weekend   the philadelphia eagle or the new orleans saint   will need to concoct some sort of recipe to neutralize two runner with different style <BRK> having both of them is special   the quarterback jared goff said   because it give you a real dual threat of back  <BRK>gurley  a three time pro bowl selection who rushed for     yard during the regular season  ha speed and savvy  with an ability to bounce to the outside  anderson  on the other hand  is not a sculpted piece of clay  he ha curve  a runner who resembles jerome bettis more than he doe eric dickerson  but if his center of gravity were any lower  he would be underground  and he burst through the line of scrimmage like the kool aid man <BRK>together  they made the cowboy look hapless   a stunning turn of event for a defensive unit that had  only a week earlier  limited the seattle seahawks and their top ranked running game to   yard in the wild card round <BRK>now  the ram  in just their third season back in los angeles after bolting from st  louis  are one win from the super bowl <BRK> to be able to even play for a super bowl is crazy  man   gurley said   it s crazy  i can t even really explain it right now  <BRK>gurley and anderson did their handiwork behind the best offensive line in the league  and they were both quick to credit their teammate for creating massive seam in dallas  defense  gurley  for example  wa asked to detail what had transpired on his   yard touchdown run in the second quarter <BRK> i ran   he said   those guy did a great job  all i had to do wa cut one time  and just run  <BRK>even goff  a talented young passer  got involved in the ground game  scrambling for an   yard run on third and   late in the fourth quarter to help seal the win <BRK>gurley  who tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee a a college junior at georgia in    missed the final two game of the ram  regular seaon with left knee inflammation  if the injury wa a concern for the ram at the time  it turned out to have been beneficial in a couple of way <BRK>first  gurley had nearly a month to recuperate and recharge  ahead of saturday s game  some of his teammate said they could sense that he looked fresh   and a fresh gurley is a dangerous gurley   for his part  gurley said he  would ve been fresh  for the playoff no matter the circumstance  <BRK>second  gurley s absence late in the regular season meant that the ram had to add another running back to the roster  enter anderson <BRK> i guess it wa a good thing i got hurt  you know   gurley said <BRK>in the two game that gurley missed  anderon made an impression  rushing for   yard against the arizona cardinal and another   yard against the san francisco  er  both win  coach sean mcvay made the transition look almost seamless <BRK> i think it s a testament to the maturity of our offense that we had somebody new come in and welcomed him with open arm so that he could come in and produce the way he could produce   the left guard rodger saffold iii said   but i also think it s a credit to c  j  that he could come in and understand the offense within four day  and it s not just any offense  it s mcvay s offense  there are a lot of word and a lot of category and a lot of switch  and there are long  long play  <BRK>before saturday s game  anderson saw peyton manning  the retired quarterback  seeing manning  anderson said  reminded him of conversation they had when they were teammate with the bronco  anderson recalled how manning once told him how difficult it had been for him when the indianapolis colt released him <BRK>anderson can relate now more than ever <BRK> he felt he could still play   anderson said   and he came to denver and lit it up  it kind of feel like that  everybody ha a turn  and it wa my turn this year
