when robert kraft finish dealing with solicitation charge in florida  his soccer team could use some help <BRK>creditcreditadam glanzman for the new york time<BRK><BRK>by kevin draper<BRK>foxborough  mass    robert k  kraft s new england patriot are a very good football team  having won six super bowl championship the past   year  they are     against the a f c  east division rival buffalo bill during that span <BRK>in a cruel twist of fate  robert kraft s other team that play at gillette stadium  the new england revolution  might a well be the buffalo bill of major league soccer  there wa a run of dominance   four m l s  cup final appearance in six year   without a championship  and a mostly fallow period now going on a decade  the team is below            since    the year after it went to it third straight m l s  cup final <BRK>kraft ha bigger concern at the moment than the revolution  he is facing two misdemeanor charge of soliciting prostitution at a massage parlor in jupiter  fla   kraft denies illegal activity   kraft most likely won t face jail time  but the charge could result in a fine or a suspension or both from the national football league  where he ha become one of the most powerful owner  and from major league soccer  where he also enjoys a long  close relationship with the commissioner <BRK>if his attention turn back to his soccer team  he is likely to find a house in the middle of a major overhaul <BRK> one of our strategy last year wa to instill a new culture at the club   said brad friedel  the former united state national team goalkeeper hired to turn around the team last year  he said a tear down had been necessary   we felt that there needed to be a completely different work ethic  <BRK>friedel spoke before the revolution s home opener last weekend  a     loss to the columbus crew  he praised his team s recent signing  but he didn t hesitate to criticize the team he took over   we needed leader   he said   we didn t have a lot of leader last year  <BRK>there is no tom brady here <BRK>the revolution began play in    a one of major league soccer s   original team  kraft  alongside lamar hunt and philip anschutz  recruited don garber from the n f l  to be the league s commissioner  and that tight group helped keep m l s  afloat in the early  s  when it wa on the verge of collapse <BRK>but while kraft ha been able to master the n f l   the soccer revolution in america ha mostly passed him <BRK>the revolution are one of three m l s  team that still play in cavernous football stadium  the others  atlanta united and the seattle sounder  justify it drawing the largest average attendance figure in the league  but only     fan showed up for the revolution s home opener last weekend  the revolution will draw better when there isn t snow on the ground  of course  but last year s average attendance ranked  th in the league <BRK>the team ha been trying to build a soccer specific stadium somewhere in the boston area since    in the   year since  site have been proposed  million have been spent on architectural rendering  and plot of land have almost been purchaed  all to eventually collapse for one reaon or another  a new multimillion dollar training center will open this seaon  but that too will be in foxborough  even a the boston stadium search go on <BRK> it s about getting into a stadium that will transform soccer in our region   the team president  brian bilello  said   with that in mind  we have been patient  probably to a fault  to try and get the right project done  <BRK>in garber s mind  most of the revolution s problem would be fixed a new stadium   my view is their economic model is challenging in gillette   he said   it ha not been able to tap into the young  millennial sport fan in the boston metropolitan area because it is further away  <BRK>the couple hundred die hard revolution fan tailgating in the parking lot before the home opener weren t so sure  the stadium search ha gone on for so long that they rarely get their hope up anymore  a number of them said that it feel a if the revolution are a distant priority for the kraft <BRK>bilello and garber deny that is the case  still  the n f l  is a    billion a year league  and a social  financial and cultural presence far bigger than m l s  kraft sits on some of the n f l  s most powerful committee  his son  jonathan kraft  hold those role on m l s  committee and seems to handle most of the team s day to day business <BRK>last year  the kraft spent    million to buy their third team  the boston uprising  an e sport team that competes in the overwatch league  the sardonic joke among some revolution supporter is that now they re not even the neglected second child  but something even worse  the ignored middle child <BRK>the team declined to make either robert or jonathan kraft available for this article <BRK>over the year  the revolution have dabbled in signing higher priced player  but none ha proved a particularly large draw or game changing addition on the field  the team now want to give young homegrown player  like isaac angking  nicolas firmino and justin rennicks  a real pathway to first team minute and success <BRK>this off season  the team also acquired carles gil  a spanish midfielder friedel hope will jump start the attack  along with other player who figure to make an impact  like edgar castillo and juan fernando caicedo  bilello said that the team s spending on player had been ramping up and that the kraft were giving the team all the money it needed to compete  both bilello and friedel promised that another designated player   the league s highest salary classification   would arrive in either may or july  once contractual issue could be worked out  they would not reveal the player s identity <BRK>the team is also building a new    million training center adjacent to gillette stadium that will house both the first team and the academy  the center will feature a number of grass and artificial turf training pitch   the team s current training pitch is covered in snow  so it ha been practicing at gillette stadium   and the state of the art facility that  team official hope  will help persuade new player to join <BRK>soccer is soccer  though  and building a winning team is mostly the same the world over  the thing that make m l s  unique  according to friedel  who spent nearly two decade playing in england and other top european league  is that it is constantly evolving <BRK> whether there is a new rule  a new stadium  a new training ground  other new designated player  a new club  a new franchise  a new second division  a new third division   he said  ticking off the list of possibility   all these thing happened in this country because the league is growing  <BRK>the last four m l s  cup have been won team that weren t original league member  and the last few year have witnessed a steady expansion of the league  when m l s  fan think of the most exciting team now  they are often thinking of bright new team with bright new stadium with bright young star  club like atlanta united and los angeles f c <BRK> at time it is easier to be new  and it is easier to be a new and improved  than it is to be a legacy business   garber said <BRK>in new england  they know how true this is <BRK>email kevin draper at kevin draper nytimes com or follow him on twitter
