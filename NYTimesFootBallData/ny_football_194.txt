 <BRK>  <BRK> a team compete for spot in the conference championship game  patrick mahomes make his playoff debut  philip river try to beat the patriot and ezekiel elliott look to run all over the ram  <BRK> by benjamin hoffman <BRK> it will be hard to match the excitement of the n f l  s wild card weekend  in which the colt won with an upset on the road  the cowboy barely survived against the seahawks  the charger invented a new defense to stop the raven and the eagle shocked the bear with help from a tipped field goal attempt  <BRK> helping matter will be the playoff debut of the chief  patrick mahomes and the return to action of quarterback tom brady and drew brees  the ram would also like to remind everyone that it wa only a few week ago that they were considered super bowl favorite  <BRK> here are our prediction for how the divisional round will sort out  both in term of who will win and who will win against the spread  <BRK> record against the spread in the wild card round        <BRK>     p m  saturday  nbc <BRK> the colt  defense is not talked about that much  individual player did not rack up a lot of big round number that could be pointed to a meaures of success  denico autry led the team with nine sack and kenny moore led it with three interception  the one player whose number stood out wa the rookie linebacker darius leonard  who led the n f l  in tackle   not a statistic most people follow closely  beyond him  the breakout star wa the team s defensive coordinator  matt eberflus  <BRK> regardless  from week   forward  indianapolis allowed the fewest point in the n f l  and now  after nearly shutting out the houston texan in the wild card round  the colt will be asked to prove that their success is not a fluke against the chief  who scored the third most point in a single n f l  season  <BRK> the best offense the colt faced this season wa new england s  and that wa during their slow start  in truth  there doe not appear to be a way to slow kansa city  led the second year star quarterback patrick mahomes  the chief scored fewer than   point only four time this season  and never scored fewer than     and were     in those game  <BRK> so the question becomes whether the colt  no name defense and a chilly  possibly snowy day at kansa city s arrowhead stadium can slow the chief enough to let andrew luck and the indianapolis offense make this a game  <BRK> there are path to victory for both team  but the most likely result is a win the chief  that s hardly an insult to the colt  a balanced team that ha been fun to watch but that ha the misfortune of being the first team to face mahomes in the playoff   <BRK> pick to win  chief <BRK> pick against the spread  chief      <BRK>     p m  saturday  fox <BRK> when los angeles wrapped up a thrilling     win over the chief in week    the ram appeared to have all but punched their ticket to the super bowl  they were      they had just defeated the only team considered a real threat to them and their defense wa finally making big play commensurate with the production of the team s high flying offense   <BRK> they went     the rest of the way  looking nowhere near a sharp on offense and losing the only two game they played against decent competition   win against the lion  the cardinal and the  er were hardly something to hang your hat on this seaon  along the way  los angeles lost the no    seed in the n f c  to the new orleans saint  <BRK> that brings u to the divisional round  coach sean mcvay  who ha become the toast of the n f l   is hoping for a better effort from his team than last year s upset loss in the same round  in which his offense managed   point against the atlanta falcon  <BRK> a big factor will be the health of todd gurley  the ram  do everything running back  gurley had     yard from scrimmage and   touchdown this seaon  but a a result of a knee injury he ha not carried the ball since dec    and is still described a limited in the team s practice report   <BRK> if gurley s knee is sound  or at least a reasonable approximation of sound  the ram should be able to outpace the more grinding cowboy  offense fairly easily  but they will need to keep their foot on the gas because the worst case scenario for los angeles would be keeping thing close enough that dallas can put the ball in the hand of ezekiel elliott  the n f l  s leading rusher  elliott would feast against a defense that allowed a horrendous     yard a carry this season  <BRK> pick to win  ram <BRK> pick against the spread  ram    <BRK>     p m  sunday  cbs <BRK> to hold philip river s playoff loss to the patriot against him is a little ridiculous when you consider the loss came in   and    to hold his regular season record versus the patriot against him might be fairer  he wa     in those game  and the win came with matt cassel starting for new england  <BRK> this charger team  though  is far more than river  it finished sixth in scoring offense and eighth in scoring defense this season  and if not for the unfortunate circumstance of having to share a division with the chief  los angeles would be hosting this game rather than traveling to the harsh condition of foxborough s gillette stadium  <BRK> predicting playoff failure for coach bill belichick and tom brady ha been a fool s errand  especially in the divisional round  where they are      but this game could come down to a pair of guy named melvin  <BRK> on offense  the charger rely heavily on running back melvin gordon  he had     yard from scrimmage and   touchdown despite missing four game and being limited injury in others  his production allowed river to pick and choose when he would take a chance downfield to keenan allen or mike williams  the team had to work around his injury in the regular seaon  which led to more playing time for austin ekeler and justin jackson  which could come in handy this weekend  a gordon is nursing injury to both knee  <BRK> on defense  the charger can unleash melvin ingram on brady  if the fleet footed lamar jackson had trouble running away from the defensive end  just imagine how quickly ingram can close the space between him and brady   <BRK> ingram had only seven sack in the regular season  but he wa a menace last weekend against baltimore  with a pair of sack and a seemingly endless stream of play that ended up with him in the backfield  with joey bosa finally healthy  the charger have the ability to penetrate even the best offensive line  and that could be a major disruption when one considers how thin new england is at wide receiver   <BRK> no one should be surprised if the patriot find a way to win   that s what they do   but the charger were a better team this season  and river ha a good chance of surprising everyone and finally beating brady  <BRK> pick to win  charger <BRK> pick against the spread  charger    <BRK>     p m  sunday  fox <BRK> if you subtract week    when they were clearly making no effort to win  the saint have lost just one game since week    and that one wa a freakish outlier in which drew brees and the offense simply never showed up against a motivated cowboy  defense   <BRK> even in that defeat  new orleans could take away some positive  a the defense allowed only   point  in wa one of nine game this seaon in which the saint allowed fewer than   point  dennis allen ha turned the unit into something worth celebrating over the lat two year   <BRK> make no mistake  however  people come to the saint to see the offense  and it more than delivered with the third most point in the n f l  this seaon  brees wa brilliant  connecting with michael thoma for an n f l  leading   catch  but the running game wa just a vital  generating the sixth most rushing yard in the league       and the most rushing touchdown       <BRK> philadelphia followed last year s super bowl win having the  rd ranked defense in the n f l  this season  the team ha won four straight  including last weekend s wild card game  a stretch in which it ha knocked off three playoff team in the ram  the texan and the bear  there ha been no better story in the n f l  over the last two season than nick foles  ace reliever  but expecting the magic to continue is a step too far  the saint are better at offense  better at defense and have a fairly fresh memory of being shockingly eliminated in last year s playoff to motivate them   <BRK> pick to win  saint <BRK> pick against the spread  saint     <BRK> benjamin hoffman is a senior staff editor and regular contributor to the
