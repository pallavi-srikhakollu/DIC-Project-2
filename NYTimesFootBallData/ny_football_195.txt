young player with dream of glory think elite training program lead to rich  they do  just rarely for them  <BRK> a training session at a semi professional program in rio de janeiro in february creditcreditdado galdieri for the new york time <BRK>  <BRK> by tariq panja and manuela andreoni <BRK> rio de janeiro   even in death the haggling went on  <BRK> christian esmério wa going to be the one   his family had been sure of it  <BRK> he wa   and towering  a soccer player with an easy smile that belied his prowess between the goal post  already there wa talk of contract  and of buying a home for his parent  who had poured all their saving into the dream that their son might be the next great brazilian soccer export   the next ronaldo  ronaldinho or neymar  <BRK> now  his father stood in a daze of grief outside a rio office building  surrounded lawyer  just day earlier  christian had burned to death in a fire at the youth academy of one of south america s most famous soccer club  flamengo  he wa one of   player killed  <BRK> the death lifted the veil over international soccer s biggest production line  and raised sweeping question about a brutal apparatus that chew up untold number of young brazilian boy for every star it mint  <BRK> but for the moment  a lawyer sparred over how much money family of the player killed in the blaze should get  there wa just one simple question  what wa christian worth  <BRK>  dream   <BRK> the word hung in the air a rafael stival let out a sigh  <BRK> mr  stival s for profit talent scouting operation had posted a note on facebook mourning three of it graduate who had died in the fire at flamengo  since then  the message had been pouring in  <BRK> they were not condolence  the facebook post had inadvertently acted a an advertisement   a signal to ambitious parent that mr  stival s organization could get their boy into not just any club  but the great flamengo  they wanted mr  stival to give their boy a chance  <BRK> the soccer world in brazil is populated a variety of actor  some drawn glory  but almost all attracted the chance of breaking out of poverty  maybe even striking it rich  <BRK> there are the boy  of course  and their family  there are the investor and the middleman like mr  stival  who trawl the continent size country in search of prospect a young a    and there are the team  many in a state of such financial disarray that only the sale of the latest star keep them afloat  <BRK> the profit from investing wisely  and early  in even a single player can run into the ten of million of dollar  <BRK> to many in the game  the industry ha grown out of control  it ha morphed from a system intended to develop promising player into an international market whose value is    billion a year  according to soccer s global governing body  fifa  in this speculative environment  talented young athlete   some of them child   are bought and sold like any other raw material  in brazil  the best one are even referred to that way  a  gem   <BRK> no one know for sure how many boy are in brazil s youth soccer system  <BRK> there are no official figure  estimate range from     to      but that is hard to corroborate  the brazilian soccer federation make no effort to track player until they turn   and become professional  <BRK> but one thing is known  on the night of the flamengo fire  feb     more than two dozen boy   most from poor family  and all hoping to achieve a dream   were asleep in a club dormitory  <BRK> in a country obsessed with soccer  flamengo pride itelf on being the most popular team  with wealth that is the envy of rival across south america  but that adoration and power  it appears  may have allowed flamengo to escape for year any real censure for the treatment of boy in it care  <BRK> in    rio state prosecutor sued flamengo over the condition at it training center  the prosecutor cited child protection failure  declaring the condition to be  even worse than those currently offered to juvenile delinquent   <BRK> city official issued an order closing the facility in    but never carried it out  limiting their sanction to dozen of fine  <BRK> in recent year  flamengo spent million to upgrade it youth academy  last year  club official boasted that the new facility would be the best in brazil  <BRK> but the dormitory holding   sleeping boy on the night of the fire wa a makeshift structure  consisting of six steel container fused together  it had never been inspected  according to local authority  <BRK> interview with survivor of the fire and official who investigated it suggest that a series of failure may have contributed to the boy  death  <BRK>   federal regulation require at least one caretaker for every   boy  but there wa no adult present at the time of the fire  <BRK>   survivor said the only exit from the dorm wa at it far end  some of the boy may have been in bed farther away from the exit than the   foot limit required the regulation  <BRK>   the room had sliding door  another violation because they can jam  <BRK>   and while each room had a window  the opening were covered with grate  <BRK> one boy who wa in christian s room told investigator their door had stuck when he tried to get out  the boy managed to slide through the window grate  but christian  a strapping   foot   goalkeeper  could not  when rescuer got to him  his body wa so badly charred he could be identified only through dental record  <BRK> flamengo official did not respond to interview request  but in february  it president  rodolfo landim  denied knowing about any irregularity when he spoke at a news conference after the fire  <BRK>  our goal is to solve this problem a quickly a possible   he said  <BRK> soccer is hardly the only industry to attract brazil s desperate  <BRK> sergio rangel  a journalist who ha covered the sport for three decade  say the youth training system reminds him of the giant gold mine in serra pelada  the horrific condition there were immortalized the photographer sebastião salgado in the  s  <BRK> desperately poor men from all over the country swarmed the mine s open pit  turning over rock in the hope of finding the nugget that would change their life  <BRK> soccer ha also been a fool s gold of sort for many family  some of them move hundred  even thousand of mile to enroll their son in training program that will sort  scrutinize and  more often than not  reject their child a worthless  <BRK>  pick one up  turn it over  and throw it away if it s no good   mr  rangel said  <BRK> the young men are not just disposable  to those who run the industry  they are often indistinguishable  <BRK> that much wa clear at a memorial for the   player who died at flamengo  midway through the service  a team official rushed to cover a large montage of photo of the boy  someone had realized that a player who survived had been mistakenly included  <BRK> the street of xerém  about   kilometer outside rio  teem with boy of various age in red  green and white jersey   the color of the fluminense soccer club  <BRK> until the team built it training complex there  xerém wa little more than a swamp  local say  but now  despite the humid heat that top   degree fahrenheit  it is home to player and family whose life revolve around the club  <BRK> among them earlier this year wa an   year old nicknamed maradoninha  for his resemblance to the former argentine great diego maradona  even in this hotly competitive town  maradoninha wa attracting attention  <BRK> two year ago  a talent scout from fluminense saw the boy  whose real name is leandro gomes feitosa  play in a local tournament and approached his family  the boy wa only    and brazilian law doe not allow soccer club to house child under    but if the family could get to rio  the scout said  fluminense would train him  <BRK>  a group of local businessmen put up the money   for a cut of future proceeds   and the family moved more than     mile  from the town of palmas to xerém  to pursue the dream  <BRK> almost all the family living in their community of   rowhouses have a similar story  maradoninha s father  evandro feitosa  said  <BRK> maradoninha may not be old enough for high school  but he know his family s future is tied to his skill with a soccer ball   god willing   he said   i ll become a big player to help my family in palmas  my family here and those in need   <BRK> the chance of making it are slim  fewer than   percent of the soccer prospect in brazil will ever make it a professional  most estimate  fewer still will earn a decent wage in the game  a study published the brazilian soccer federation in   found that   percent of soccer player in the country earned le than     reais      each month  <BRK> and for maradoninha and his family  the odds recently got even slimmer  fluminense released him  <BRK> whatever the odds  whatever the hardship  there are enough soccer success story to feed the hope of young boy and family who have little else to aspire to  <BRK> there is neymar  so successful he is more international brand than player  he is the product of a humble neighborhood on the outskirt of são paulo  there are rivaldo  ronaldo and romário  three former brazilian world cup winner  all awarded the title of best player in the world in their time fifa  <BRK> and most recently  there is vinicius junior  a flahy forward who rose out of flamengo s youth rank  he once trained on the same field a the   boy killed in the fire  and then he began living the dream  in    when he wa    spain s real madrid agreed to pay   million euro  just over    million  for his right after he played just   minute in his debut game  <BRK> all of those player  and hundred more  have emerged from the brazil s soccer mill to ply their trade on the world s biggest stage  <BRK> in his early day in the sport  christian s parent used all they had   and borrowed from friend and neighbor   to finance his soccer dream  <BRK> he seemed to be getting closer to his own version of the soccer success story  on march    the day he turned    he wa expected to sign his first professional contract at flamengo  his dream  year in the making  wa in reach  <BRK> he died four week before that birthday  <BRK> day after his death  his father  cristiano esmério  wa standing outside an office tower in downtown rio where public defender were meeting with official from flamengo  he wa with a group of lawyer  one turned to him  <BRK> when it came to compensation  the lawyer said  it would be unfair if christian s family wa treated the same a the others  after all  he said  some of the dead boy had been recent arrival to the club  but christian wa different  he had been called up to one of brazil s youth national team  clearly he wa worth more than the rest  <BRK> esmério nodded silently  he and his son had discussed money  too  <BRK>  dad  let s look for a house   he recall christian saying when he got word that he wa closing in on a professional contract   my first paycheck  i want to pay for a house for my mom  so she doesn t have to suffer because she doesn t have water or electricity   <BRK> a week before he died  the boy posted a tribute to his family on facebook  above two picture of father and son taken a decade apart  he made a promise  <BRK>  all the sacrifice will be compensated  my old man   <BRK>  <BRK>
