<BRK><BRK>on pro football<BRK>by marc tracy<BRK>indianapolis   first it wa kyler murray s height  then it wa kyler murray s weight  and then  after kyler murray s weight  it wa kyler murray s hand size <BRK>by friday  when murray appeared before the news medium  the chatter at the weeklong n f l  combine   an annual predraft meat market that make little pretense of being anything subtler   had been dominated discussion of his physical qualification  or lack thereof   doe he  the heisman trophy winning quarterback for oklahoma who is preparing for april s draft  really have what is needed to succeed a a pro <BRK>gil brandt  the former dallas cowboy personnel chief  could not remember more buzz around a draft prospect <BRK> this is the most in history   brandt said   and i ve been doing this since    <BRK>a number of factor have contributed to the kyler craze <BRK>three month ago  he and scott bora  the most powerful of baeball agent  told anyone who aked that murray planned to finish his sole seaon a the sooner  starting quarterback and then report to spring training with the oakland athletics  who picked him ninth over all in lat year s major league baeball draft and agreed to pay him a      million signing bonus <BRK>instead  after acquitting himself admirably in a national playoff semifinal loss to alabama  murray announced that his focus would remain on football after all  he effectively spurned the a s and their money in favor of pursuing his gridiron dream  even though a quarterback go  he is  charitably speaking  not tall <BRK>murray did not know what n f l  team thought of him until he completed his productive   seaon  he told several dozen journalist on friday a they gathered in a corner of the mammoth indianapolis convention center   the n f l  kind of heated up   he said   and here we are  <BRK>recently  there have been a couple of successful quarterback who stand south of six foot tall  but just how short  or tall  is murray  clearly the neutral arbiter that is the n f l  combine would figure this out  that is what happens here <BRK>and his hand  are they big enough  is his palm of requisite heft to support a regulation football  his finger sufficiently long to curl around the ball s pebbled leather   a is often the cae when the topic is men and sport  there is subtext  and size matter  <BRK>murray wa measured thursday  and the white smoke from the sacred space soon emitted good news  he is small  but not too small <BRK>height    foot  ⅛ inch   a they always say  football is a game of eighth of an inch  <BRK>weight    pound  he wa closer to   while playing for oklahoma last season  he said <BRK>hand size  nine and one half inch  from the pinkie s tip to the thumb s  which is  apparently  ordinary for a quarterback <BRK> i showed up  they told me to put my hand down  told me to stand here  step on the scale  and that s what i did   murray said friday   and everybody made a big deal about it  <BRK>in fairness  this is a big deal   a big in it way  you might say  a the     inch hand of cowboy quarterback dak prescott  in proving his physical adequacy  murray held out the chance of becoming that most valuable of sport commodity  a franchise quarterback <BRK>and yet the prototypical quarterback is bigger than murray  the better to see and throw over his hulking offensive linemen and the equally hulking linemen on the other team  at combine past  for example  tom brady wa measured at      cam newton at      patrick mahomes at over     <BRK>drew brees and russell wilson are two current franchise quarterback closer to murray s stature  murray ha talked with wilson  another standout baseball player  a couple of time <BRK> good to have him in my corner   murray said   obviously  i look up to him    literally  during his combine  wilson wa measured at    ⅝  <BRK>also close to murray and wilson is baker mayfield  who wa measured at     during last year s combine  murray backed up mayfield at oklahoma for the   season  when mayfield won the heisman  after which the cleveland brown drafted him first over all <BRK>there is a tantalizing subplot to the question of whether murray will follow mayfield a the top pick  the arizona cardinal hold the no    slot  but they selected a quarterback  josh rosen  early in the first round lat year <BRK>however  they have since changed head coach  and the new top man  kliff kingsbury  both played quarterback and coached in the air raid system   the offensive scheme in which murray thrived at oklahoma  and that mahomes  a former kingsbury protégé  proved transferable to the n f l  during his outstanding   season with the kansa city chief <BRK>ha murray met with the cardinal  yes  he said friday  he ha <BRK>murray clarified a few other thing a well  patiently addressing the scrum of reporter  his average size hand at his side <BRK>yes  football is his final answer <BRK> i wa born a football player   he said   i love this game  there is no turning back  <BRK>no  he is not concerned that in choosing football over baseball  he doomed himself to a smaller paycheck  a reporter brought up the   year     million contract that wa reached on thursday between the philadelphia phillies and bryce harper  how much is that per year  murray wished to know  about      million <BRK> there s quarterback making more than him a year   murray said  and indeed there are <BRK>and  no  he doe not fear that his choice will mean a greater likelihood of injury   you can t play this game scared   he said <BRK>team that wish to evaluate him further will have to wait a little longer  the group of player with whom murray ha proceeded through the combine will do on field drill saturday at lucas oil stadium  but murray will not join them  instead  he will throw and run for scout on march   back on campus at oklahoma <BRK> the population of norman will grow about   people   brandt said   every coach and general manager will be there
