super bowl liii <BRK> a knee injury took away one of the ram  most consistent option on offense  he join a fraternity of player forced to sit out their first super bowl  <BRK> creditcreditharry how getty image <BRK>  <BRK> by benjamin hoffman <BRK> atlanta   to miss a super bowl because of an injury is bad enough  to have it happen in your first super bowl seems especially cruel  in the case of cooper kupp  the standout slot receiver for the los angeles ram  it s hard to say whether the anguish this weekend  will be greater for him or for his team   <BRK> kupp     entered his second seaon a one of the ram  top three wide receiver  alongside brandin cook and robert wood  but in the team s     start he emerged a the one quarterback jared goff would look for when thing got particularly difficult   kupp earned that trust catching   percent of the pases thrown his way and scoring five touchdown in those five game   <BRK> but on sunday  a the ram try to beat the new england patriot and win the franchise s first championship since the   seaon  kupp will be reduced to a spectator  a knee sprain cost him most of week   through   and a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee  which he sustained in week    ended his seaon   several high profile player  like carson wentz  von miller and jeremy shockey  have found themselves in the same position in recent year  all feeling a deep sense of loss even a they tried to share their teammate  joy  <BRK> kupp  a third generation n f l  player   his grandfather  jake  wa a guard in the  s and  s  and his father  craig  a backup quarterback in the early  s   ha plenty of emotional support  and while he is staying away from the team s official medium appearance this week  he is with the ram in atlanta  which is not always a given for injured player  <BRK> while los angeles still ha plenty of star on offense  there is no getting around what the team lost when kupp went down for the season  <BRK> the number are fairly stark  goff had completed     percent of his pass through week   and had a passer rating of    in the six regular season game goff played after kupp s injury  those number were reduced to     percent and       <BRK> cook and wood remained viable threat  but the shuffling of role created some disarray  and josh reynolds  who stepped in a the third receiver  could not match kupp s reliability  there wa a sense that without kupp  the ram went from invincible to merely great  <BRK> coach sean mcvay put thing fairly bluntly to reporter shortly after kupp s injury   anytime you lose a player of cooper s caliber and what he s meant to our offense  you don t replace guy like that   mcvay said  <BRK> but the ram are in the super bowl anyway  wood  who ha largely assumed kupp s role in the offense   said he felt it wa important for kupp to be included in everything leading up the game because he is a big reason the team got this far  wood ha a fairly simple idea about how the ram can  make up for the frustration that kupp undoubtedly feel   we ve got to get him a ring   <BRK> player miss the super bowl a a result of injury every year  some star have made it back to the big game  other have not  here is a look at some other high profile player who had to deal with being sidelined in their first shot at the sport s ultimate honor   <BRK> super bowl lii <BRK> the eagle  run to a super bowl victory over the patriot last year wa fueled outrage about being declared underdog  in large part because wentz  the philadelphia quarterback and a candidate for the n f l  s most valuable player award  wa lost for the season after he tore a knee ligament in week    with wentz  the eagle had been considered a favorite to win the championship  <BRK> in the week leading up to the eagle      triumph over new england  the player and coach rallied around the backup quarterback  nick foles  wearing rubber dog mask and relishing the idea that no one believed in them  wentz did his best to project happiness for his teammate  cinderella story  while not attempting to hide his own frustration  <BRK>  every time the offense come on the field on sunday  it s tough   wentz said of the game he missed   it hit me a little bit  but then i m in it  i love these guy  and i m a part of this team a much a anybody else   <BRK> the asumption wa that wentz would step back into his role a the team s starting quarterback this seaon and that philadelphia could be even stronger  instead  the eagle slipped into the playoff behind foles  not wentz  who wa sidelined a fractured vertebra after week    foles and the team lost in the divisional round of the playoff  the eagle have emphatically committed to wentz going forward  but his absence from a second playoff run muddied the water somewhat for the team s fan   <BRK> super bowl xlviii <BRK> that miller s career survived the   seaon is still a thing of wonder  the no    pick in the   draft  miller wa phenomenal in his first two seaon  totaling   sack  the outside linebacker began his third seaon under suspension after violating the n f l  s substance abuse policy and ended it tearing the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee in week    he wa regularly accused of being a distraction  and he had to watch from the sideline a his teammate were trounced the seahawks       in the super bowl   <BRK> plenty of player have had their career derailed similar issue  but miller  with support from his family and his team  found a way to get  back on track  <BRK> it took miller just two season to get another shot at the super bowl  <BRK>  it s another chance at greatness   he said of his team making it to super bowl   against the carolina panther three year ago   it doesn t come around often  we got another chance   <BRK> he took full advantage of that chance  ruining cam newton s day and earning the super bowl m v p  award   <BRK> super bowl xlv <BRK> the steelers had won two super bowl in the previous five seaon and were looking like something of a dynaty  drafting  th in    the team selected pouncey  a center who stepped in a a starter from day   and earned a pro bowl spot for his exceptional play  <BRK> pouncey  who wa just   at the time  wa on track to become one of the youngest starter in super bowl history  but he injured an ankle in pittsburgh s win over the jet in the a f c  championship game  forcing the steelers to scramble to replace him  <BRK>  i say we have two week to maybe try and fool everybody and get maurkice s brother in here and no one would know   ben roethlisberger said in reference to maurkice s twin brother  mike  also an n f l  lineman  roethlisberger added   i don t think that s going to work   <BRK> the steelers ultimately lost the super bowl       to aaron rodgers and the green bay packer  and pouncey  despite a nine year career that ha included two first team all pro selection and seven pro bowl selection  ha yet to get another chance at the big game   <BRK> super bowl xlii <BRK> shockey wa in his sixth year with the giant when the team unexpectedly made a run to the super bowl in the   season  shockey had been a key part of the team s offense from his first day in the n f l   averaging   catch and   yard a season from the tight end position  but his   season ended when he broke his fibula in week    <BRK> some pundit said the giant played better without the brash tight end  an assessment that did not sit well with mathias kiwanuka  a defensive end who also missed the team s dramatic     upset of the previously undefeated patriot   <BRK>  that guy  he put his heart and soul into the organization for a long time   kiwanuka said   he wa a vocal leader  an energy guy  and he wa kind of the face and voice of this team for a long time  so for guy to say  and people here to say  we are better off without him a a player  it sting a lot  especially when you play a hard a he did   <BRK> shockey never played for the giant again  the team traded him to the new orleans saint in the off season  thing turned out fine for both side  shockey caught a touchdown pas for the saint in their super bowl xliv win  and the giant upset the patriot again in super bowl
