<BRK>doug mill  a new york time photographer who usually cover politics in wahington  ha lost count of exactly how many of the   super bowl he s photographed  but his best guess  sunday wa his  nd time on the sideline of the country s consistently most popular entertainment event on television <BRK>a million of american set down buffalo chicken dip and cold beer in front of the tv and crowded into bar to watch the contest between the los angeles ram and the new england patriot in super bowl liii  mr  mill packed three camera  four lens  two extra battery and extra ethernet cable  and headed into atlanta s mercedes benz stadium <BRK>the super bowl is a special assignment for photographer  up there with the olympic game and presidential campaign   but packed into just a few hour <BRK> just like the athlete  the photographer have to be on their game   mr  mill said <BRK>he wa one of three photographer shooting the game and surrounding pageantry for the time s sport desk on sunday  they were joined five reporter and two photo assistant  plus another photographer shooting photo for the graphic desk  and they filed to four photo editor  six word editor and two graphic editor <BRK>those three sport photographer were poised to take a lot of picture  record from the time s photo lab show that three people produced just over     image at the   game  mr  mill estimated he d take     to     this year <BRK> all you can do is ask for it to happen in front of you   the big play   mr  mill said <BRK>the task for photographer shooting the game is to tell the story of the night  and it promise the chance to capture sport history  like in   when mr  mill photographed david tyree catching a pas on his helmet during a drive that won the giant super bowl xlii and spoiled the patriot  perfect season  or in    when a j  mast  who joined mr  mill on his fifth time shooting the game for the time  photographed the patriot  malcolm butler intercepting an ill advised seahawks pas in the end zone  securing super bowl xlix for new england   a game telling picture   mr  mast said  <BRK>to capture those moment  they said  they absorb themselves in the game  trying to anticipate significant play based on how the game unfolds <BRK> i call it staying in the viewfinder   mr  mast said <BRK>and they must be thorough  getting everything that could be significant from a variety of perspective  there s no telling whether a first quarter touchdown will turn out to be the only touchdown of the game  or whether a referee will end up making a call that alters the game s course  by the end  they must also have image that reflect how the game wa won in between those memorable moment   the workhorse play that add up to the title <BRK> if los angeles is dominating and most of your photo are of tom brady passing  that doesn t make sense   said kevin d  liles  who photographed the game for the time for the first time <BRK>mr  liles shot the game from above in the stand  while mr  mill and mr  mast were on the field in either end zone  they used ethernet line that plugged into their camera to file photo directly to editor in new york  in previous year  the time had runner take memory card from photographer on the field to an editor in a photo workroom at the stadium  but last year  many of the photo editor were at the olympics in south korea  so the time used the ethernet line for the first time  mr  mast said the new workflow allowed the photo team to get a picture from the field onto the home page in a matter of minute <BRK>the team of photographer at the game for the time is also responsible for capturing the pomp and entertainment around the game  at halftime  mr  mill and mr  mast knew to look for someone seizing the spotlight to make a political statement  or at least start a viral moment  <BRK>bedel saget  a sport graphic editor for the time  wa also in the stand photographing the game  but with the goal of getting photo fit for an interactive that would break down key play  <BRK>he planned to be essentially  sitting on the shutter button   he said  trying to capture a many frame of the action a possible and filing picture of those important play to a google drive   that s when the real magic happens  <BRK>in new york  the graphic editor joe ward and anjali singhvi pulled a photo from one of those key moment from the cloud and transformed it into a   d image using third party software called mental canvas  they then created an interactive out of that   d image that allowed reader to examine the play from different perspective  moving back and forth through those perspective scrolling  the interactive includes simple annotation with each perspective to guide the reader s eye and explain how the play unfolded <BRK>when they first debuted this interactive during the   world cup  they pulled photo from the game day after they were over  but working with a live event like the super bowl  mr  ward and m  singhvi must wait to jump on the right moment a the action unfolds  which present a challenge <BRK> we don t know what we re going to get   m  singhvi said <BRK>for all the excitement and potential glory of photographing the super bowl  mr  mill said there is one way it fall short of being a dream job <BRK> it s a terrible way to watch the game  <BRK>follow the  readercenter on twitter for more
