team to consider minority candidate when hiring coach and executive in their front office <BRK>at the time  the league said it wa just trying to beef up existing regulation  not reacting to criticism that team had been skirting the rule for year <BRK> our focus wa simply  how do we make the rooney rule better   robert gulliver  the league s chief human resource officer  said  referring to the rule adopted in   and named for dan rooney  the owner of the pittsburgh steelers at the time who pushed for the regulation <BRK>now  the league s stated commitment to the rule will be put to the test <BRK>on monday  the number of african american coach fired in   soared to five  leaving only two black coach in a league where at least   percent of the player are african american <BRK>race is already a much discussed topic in relation to the league  colin kaepernick  the former san francisco  er quarterback who in   began kneeling during the national anthem to protest racism and police brutality toward people of color  ha not played in the league for the last two season  his protest amplified an already polarizing debate across the country  and he ha filed a grievance accusing the n f l  of colluding to keep him off the field <BRK>coach losing their job at the conclusion of the regular seaon is routine and expected  a they fall victim to the merciless pressure from owner and fan to succeed year after year  in addition to the five black coach fired  three white coach were let go this seaon  in green bay  tampa bay and miami  but with the n f l  under pressure to increae the percentage of minority coach and executive  the makeup of the latest clas of jettisoned coach wa especially startling <BRK>four black coach were fired sunday or monday  including the jet  todd bowles  who wa let go shortly after his team s final loss sunday  the jet had a     record in the last three season under bowles <BRK>marvin lewis  who had been at the helm of the cincinnati bengal since    wa fired monday  though he had resurrected the moribund bengal and took them to the playoff multiple time  he never won a playoff game and this season wa cincinnati s third consecutive one with a losing record <BRK>also fired monday wa denver bronco coach vance joseph  who had presided over the first back to back losing season for the bronco since the early  s  in arizona  steve wilks had been the cardinal  coach for just one season when he wa fired monday after his team compiled a league worst record of     <BRK>in october  another african american coach  hue jackson  wa fired after his team were       in roughly two and a half season <BRK>the two black head coach still in the n f l  are anthony lynn of the los angeles charger        who are headed to a wild card playoff game sunday against the baltimore raven  and mike tomlin of the pittsburgh steelers         <BRK>carolina panther coach ron rivera  who is latino  is the only other minority head coach <BRK>with eight coaching vacancy  it is possible that some of the recently dismissed coach will be leading candidate for those opening  their experience and certain attribute may be a better fit with other team  jackson  for example  wa on lewis s coaching staff in cincinnati  and there are other minority candidate  like the kansa city offensive coordinator eric bieniemy and stanford coach david shaw  whose name have popped up in coaching discussion <BRK>but the next several week will unquestionably heighten the scrutiny on the n f l  s hiring practice and how reliably  or willingly  the rooney rule will be employed <BRK>gulliver would not admit something that many onlooker and people around the n f l  have long suspected  that team have been doing only the bare minimum to comply with  or sidestepping  the rooney rule  after all  if the rule wa working a intended  and the percentage of minority coach and executive wa growing steadily  why would the rule need to be strengthened <BRK>under the new regulation enacted a few week ago  when team are looking to fill position  they must interview at least one minority candidate from a list kept the league s career development advisory panel  or a minority candidate not currently working with a team  team also must keep detailed record of who they interview  which is perhaps a response to criticism from minority candidate who say they are routinely called  but not formally interviewed  team trying to do the least possible to fulfill their obligation <BRK>after it wa first established  the rooney rule appeared to be having an impact  by    eight n f l  team had coach of color  the most to that point  or since <BRK>yet  at the same time  hiring minority front office executive did not keep pace  and recently  one of the few black general manager in the league  reggie mackenzie  who wa named the n f l  executive of the year in    wa forced out a the oakland raider chief football executive  ozzie newsome  another african american general manager  is expected to retire from his post with the raven at the end of this seaon <BRK>the n f l  ha likewise been challenged in it effort to expand opportunity for black assistant coach  a job that is the natural springboard to a head coaching position  richard lapchick  the director of the institute for diversity and ethic in sport  noted in a   report that the percentage of assistant coach of color had declined slightly to     percent  the number of african american offensive or defensive coordinator had dropped from   to    lapchick said <BRK>since assistant coach typically get swept out the door along with a fired head coach  the number of vacant n f l  coaching job this week is likely several dozen  even if the eight unoccupied head coach position garner all the attention <BRK>that is a lot of interviewing about to take place in the n f l  not long after   owner stood behind new  reinforced rule designed to increase the number minority seriously considered for just such hire <BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK>
