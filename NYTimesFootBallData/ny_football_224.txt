 <BRK>  <BRK> the stone <BRK> a commonplace modern ritual gave me a deeper connection to today s athenian   <BRK> by simon critchley <BRK> mr  critchley is a philosophy professor and author  <BRK> athens   it is about time i told you what i have really been doing here the past few month  it hasn t all been visit to archaeological site and meditation on the contemporary relevance of antiquity  today i d like to put ancient history on hold for a moment and move from the past right into the present  <BRK> it might be objected that what i have been writing is a series of postcard  perhaps with lot of local color and historical background  but nonetheless a kind of high end philosophical tourism from famous athenian location  perhaps this can t be avoided  i am  after all  a foreigner and a temporary resident  and this city s monument  with their beauty and historical grandeur  exert a pull like virtually no others  but is there perhaps a better way of connecting with ordinary athenian  with their habit and routine  maybe i could get closer to their life in the vast modern agora of this metropolis through a common passion  a passion for soccer  and what site could be more ordinary than a pub  <BRK> i am a lifelong fan of liverpool football club and spend much more time than i care to confess watching game  reading about soccer  listening to podcasts and watching endless youtube clip of highlight  news conference and often rather tedious match analysis  i will talk to any poor soul i can find about my team and about theirs  although i prefer mine  yet   much to my constant amazement   there exist people in the world who do not care for the beautiful game  <BRK> liverpool were playing the day after i arrived in athens in early january  i urgently needed to find out where to watch live game because the tv in my apartment wa pretty basic  on the morning of match day  i dipped into the internet and discovered a promising looking facebook page for  the pan hellenic liverpool friend club   i sent a message  more in hope than expectation  <BRK> three minute later  i got a reply   good morning m   you can meet u in the wee dram pub  it is a scottish pub  ask for john   <BRK> i got there early and asked for john  it wa like meeting a long lost friend  john skotidas founded the official liverpool supporter club in   and ha been running it ever since with a good deal of organizational skill  it ha     member  and liverpool are the most popular english team in greece  i ve gotten to know john quite well in the time i have been here  he wa an aircraft engineer with the greek air force for   year  before retiring at age   to pursue his other passion  watching and talking about soccer  john even ha his own youtube channel  he became a liverpool fan after seeing the beatles on tv when he wa a kid in the late  s  he just liked the name  liverpool   it sounded good  when he wa   year old  he watched them play for the first time against newcastle united in the fa cup final in   and decided to support them  he ha been a fan ever since  <BRK> i also met a number of other people in the bar on that first day  scotty  kris  spiros  who promotes bollywood movie in greece  which are apparently pretty popular  and a bunch of other greek fan  i watched my first game with them on jan     liverpool versu brighton  it wa an edgy match  but with a confident defensive display from u  we won       one nil    <BRK> since then  i ve watched an awful lot of game at the wee dram  and it ha developed into a ritual of sort  i have a talked a fair bit about the nature of ritual in this series  whether the processional pomp of the city of dionysia  the divine liturgy of mount athos or the greater mystery of eleusis  watching soccer is an undoubtedly lesser mystery  with a more humble and humdrum set of ritual action  but they also have meaning  and every fan ha their ritual and superstition  <BRK> before leaving the apartment  i carefully select my liverpool shirt  track suit or scarf  depending on the weather  but i always look a teensy bit ridiculous  and walk to syntagma or constitution square  i descend into the underworld of the subway system  take the four stop to panormou station  buy a piece of spanakopita or sumptuous spinach pie from the bakery  walk slowly uphill eating it  get to the wee dram  push open the door  scan the room for seat and look for john  he s always sitting in the same spot  it s a superstition  he told me   just next to the big tv  head down  looking at his phone  although i always try to get there early  the place is usually packed  john seems to have a secret supply of stool that he will whip out if a regular come in late and the place is too crammed with fan  <BRK> john give the nod  say a few word  and a seat open up  i shake hand with everyone  ask them how they are doing  head to the bar  buy a pint of murphy s  they don t sell guinness   sit down and check the whatsapp connection with my son edward in london  we exchange a couple of short message like  i m in position  you   and then discus the team lineup and usually wonder why our german coach juergen klopp ha included or left out a player we particularly like  the wi fi tends to keep dropping  which occasion much dashing out into the street  <BRK> the wee dram is owned ross  who incidentally used to play for the scottish national basketball team  i didn t know they had one  and support heart of midlothian  to each their own  the pub ha two main area  a glass walled central room where you can buy drink  which is where the younger lad tend to gather  standing together in small group  often wearing liverpool shirt  and a larger outside area with older fan  sitting or standing  i prefer to sit  at least until something really exciting happens and then i stand and retreat backward to the door of the pub  so i don t block anyone s view  for reason that completely escape me  i often crouch with my arm at a right angle and fist softly clenched  it s almost an attitude of prayer  <BRK> there s a large wooden central rectangular table with bench where the hard core fan sit  with john in pole position  top left  most of them are smoking  athens is a great place to pick up a pasive smoking habit  smoking is banned  of course  but greek tend to do what they want   drinking beer or coffee and betting online on their phone  just behind the central table is another  smaller table with about four or five seat  marked  reserved   although it turn out that all the table are  reserved    this is where i sit  usually with some familiar face  we talk to one another a much a we can  in broken english and fragmentary greek  but in great detail about the quality of particular player  tactic  formation and the strength of the opposition  although we don t really know one another that well  there is an immense of feeling of familiarity  affection and trust  <BRK> for the non fan  it s hard to explain how detailed these discussion are and the extraordinary level of knowledge that ordinary fan posse  although this might sound stupid  there is an amazing rational intelligence to soccer talk  bolstered a common passion for the team that we all love  <BRK> the team emerge  i sit up straight  and there is the usual fluff of tv commercial and dumb graphic before kickoff  we all clap when the whistle blow  and then we enter the shared and strangely meditative flow of the game  thing get really quiet  there is always an odd experience of tension in watching a game with a group of fellow fan  waiting for your team to score or at least have a shot or engage in a compelling passage of play  the tv in the wee dram ha useless speaker  and it is a real strain to catch the greek commentary  not really understanding the word  i listen eagerly for the name  which have an almost magical aura  van dijk  robertson  sadio mane  milner  alexander arnold  <BRK> of course  there are a lot of complaint  when there is a misplaced pas or especially when our star forward player  mohammed salah  shoot and miss  which ha been happening a lot of late  the most frequently heard word in the bar is  malakas   let s just say this is a word with a wide range of semantic connotation  many of them connected with the sin of onanism  there is a visceral connection between soccer and swearing  and i am at my most disgustingly foul mouthed when watching liverpool play  i am not proud of this fact and often try to swallow the vowel after the first consonant of the bad word ha spilled from my lip  <BRK> when we score  the place explodes  skintight anxiety suddenly release into ecstasy  everyone leap to their foot  with wild scene of joy  hugging and loud cry  i high five everyone around the table  often inaccurately  i don t know why i do it  it s not my style  but i started the habit at my first match in january and somehow feel obliged to continue because they expect it from me  it s a little awkward  <BRK> when the opposing team score  there is absolute silence in the bar  not a word  and barely any reaction  the mood shift entirely and no one speaks for at least   second  then   malakas   <BRK> my three month in athens ha been a very tense time to be a liverpool fan  a six point january lead in the english premier league ha been whittled away the relentlessness of our main opponent and reigning champion  manchester city  and the fact that we drew a number of game that we should have won  we ve lost some of our flair  flow and attacking rhythm  but we re still in there fighting  match match  grinding out victory often with last minute goal  a nerve shredding experience  <BRK> today  march    is an absolutely vital game  i arrive very early at the wee dram  about   minute before kickoff  around     p m  there is a lot of banter  more beer is being drunk than usual  and server slide through the crowd setting down pizza that are always shared  liverpool are playing tottenham hotspur  and my son edward is at the anfield road stadium with his mate ben watching live  edward is a large part of the reaon the fate of liverpool football club in this seaon s english premier league matter so much to me  i deviously programmed him in his childhood year to support liverpool  and he is now a better  more knowledgeable fan than i  but he ha never seen liverpool win the league  it is   year since it lat happened  liverpool won it   time during my first   year on planet earth  but that history feel a ancient a athens itself  <BRK> spur are a fine team  some of my best friend are spur fan  they didn t deserve to lose  but  very obligingly  they did  thanks to a goal keeping blunder from the world cup winning french captain hugo lloris off a cheeky header from the sinuous salah that ricocheted into the net off the shin of toby alderweireld in the  th minute of the match  call it luck  if you like  i choose to call it destiny  <BRK> it is hard to describe the feeling of sheer unconfined joy when your team win  everything is right with the world and the mind is free of any concern  distance or gnawing introspection  here at the wee dram  there is a genuine feeling of warmth and solidarity among fan  despite the linguistic limitation  we understand one another very well because we have a team in common  and there are   official liverpool supporter club all around the world and countless other million watching in whatever way they can  after the spur game  ross played the liverpool anthem   you ll never walk alone  gerry and the pacemaker and everyone sang along  bellowing out of tune at the top of their voice  it wa really something  <BRK> i realize that such ritual are pretty stupid  shallow and far too sentimental  but at such moment i feel a real sense of disinhibited belonging  and other people feel the same   <BRK> after the song climaxed and the final chorus faded  i finished my beer and looked for john to say goodbye  but he d already left  <BRK> will we win the league  probably not  manchester city are a better football team  but today we won  i don t so much walk a glide down the hill to the subway station  texting with edward and reading the early match report  i pick up a loaf of bread at the bakery and head back into the center of the city  life is good  <BRK> athens in piece is an eight part
