<BRK><BRK>our correspondent teleports to the past to give u this dispatch from a time when the ram were super bowl bound celebrity and the future in los angeles looked   o k   it got complicated  <BRK>by john branch<BRK>los angeles  january     it is an incredible time for fan of the los angeles ram  just when people thought the  s could not get off to a better start   especially after that mind blowing cheap trick concert at the forum on new year s eve   the ram are going to their first super bowl <BRK>it is the pinnacle for a proud franchise  the first major league sport team to make a permanent home on the west coast  way back in    the ram have not won a championship since    but super bowl xiv will surely be the first of many more super bowl for the ram and their loyal fan in los angeles <BRK> note to the national football league  roman numeral might work for movie sequel like last year s  rocky ii  and this year s  smokey and the bandit ii   but it might be unreasonable for football game  try to count in roman all the way to something like super bowl    <BRK>los angeles is the consummate ram town  that wa evident from last year s  fantasy island  episode featuring coach ray malavasi and three player  jim youngblood  anthony davis and frank corral  the ram played themselves  because everyone know the ram  especially when they wear team gear  janet leigh  ken berry  annette funicello and larry storch all played other people <BRK>it wa the latest in a lating connection between the ram and hollywood  the ram had bob hope a a part owner long before the dodger     or the lakers     arrived  in fact  the ram have been the perfect combination of sport and entertainment since receiver elroy hirsch  who wa known a crazylegs  starred in a movie about himself  and bob waterfield married jane russell <BRK>yes  the dodger are popular  but who s casting ron cey on  fantasy island    steve garvey and tommy lasorda  yes  not ron cey  <BRK>the lakers  meanwhile  have an intriguing   year old rookie named earvin johnson  though he seems big for a point guard  but they play in a second tier sport league whose championship game are on tape delay late at night  and what team would ever choose to play it home game in inglewood <BRK>aside from the ram  the team with the brightest long range prospect might be the aztec  many predict soccer will be the most popular sport in the united state someday soon <BRK>until then  this is the age of the ram  just a it always ha been  who can forget sid gillman  jon arnett and le richter on  the donna reed show   or roman gabriel a a  native  on  gilligan s island   or rosey grier appearing everywhere from  the man from u n c l e   and  bewitched  to  root  and  the love boat   and telling child that  yes   it s all right to cry  <BRK>the fearsome foursome might be the fatest way to hollywood  look what it did for deacon jones  who made bookend of the  s with appearance on the  the brady bunch      and  wonder woman       even now  merlin olsen star on  little house on the prairie   just a he did while he wa playing  cating director might keep an eye on fred dryer <BRK>it is not just that hollywood love the ram  the ram love star power  too  last season  they signed joe namath  often remembered for his role on  the brady bunch   the ram got rid of the strong kneed quarterback james harris and ron jaworski  and namath retired from football  but it worked out because now the ram have pat haden and vince ferragamo <BRK>the only better combination at quarterback would be tom jarrett and the ghost of joe pendleton in  heaven can wait   nominated for   academy award last year <BRK>that movie wa about a quarterback for the ram who died and then came back in the body of the team s other quarterback  who also died  and yet the movie still somehow predicted this week s super bowl matchup with the pittsburgh steelers <BRK>it would be even more amazing if warren beatty wore no    in the movie  like ferragamo  maybe someday the los angeles ram will have a no    at quarterback who lead them to the super bowl  his name probably won t be jarrett  but maybe something like it  only in los angeles <BRK>the ram themselves are like a movie script  the team s owner  carroll rosenbloom  drowned under mysterious circumstance in florida last off season  jonathan winter  maybe the most famous of all the ram fan  told joke at the memorial service attended beatty  jimmy stewart  diane keaton and hundred more  <BRK>most thought steve rosenbloom  a longtime team executive under his father s tutelage  would take over the team  but carroll rosenbloom left ownership to his widow  georgia     year younger than her husband and married five time before  she wa the first female n f l  owner  and promptly fired her stepson  <BRK>she ha been quite the conversation piece this week before super bowl xiv <BRK> she is the platinum blond star heroine villainess of a hollywood real life drama that is two touchdown better than  day of our life  on that soap s most gold digging  betraying  bizarrely gauche day of it life   is how the washington post sportswriter dave kindred put it <BRK>los angeles fan just hope she steer the franchise the way her late husband did  the ram are moving   mile down the freeway to anaheim for the   season  something about additional revenue from luxury box   but they still will be the los angeles ram  yes  she will soon marry for the seventh time  but her commitment to keeping the franchise in southern california appears solid <BRK>where else would they go  the ram are one of those n f l  franchise perfectly matched to it location  like the raider in oakland  the brown in cleveland and the colt in baltimore <BRK>carroll rosenbloom  actually  wa the majority owner of the baltimore colt  all the way back to    they won a bunch of championship  but he didn t think the city appreciated them enough after winning super bowl v  so in    he traded the colt for the ram  straight up  with robert irsay  everyone won <BRK>rosenbloom knew what he wa doing  he hired coach chuck knox in    and the ram have captured the division every year since  but they never had an offense a good a their defense  and they kept getting beat in the playoff  so rosenbloom brought in the former ram coach george allen in   to toughen them up <BRK>player complained  and rosenbloom fired allen after two preseason game  in a delicious hollywood twist  that is how malavasi  the offensive coordinator  got to be coach  otherwise  george allen would have been on  fantasy island  <BRK>the ram were just     this seaon  and people were surprised when they finally beat the cowboy in the playoff  but now that they are playing in the super bowl  oddsmakers have them a the underdog   it is eay to imagine them being stout for a long time under malavai <BRK>one thing on their side  they have little competition in their division  which team look like it might be better than the ram through the  s  the falcon  the saint  the hopeless  er were     this season under their first year coach  bill walsh  they drafted a quarterback named joe montana  and he barely played <BRK>so starting with this weekend s super bowl  the  s are perfectly lined up to be the ram  decade  just like the  s were  or almost were  if only the ram actually won a championship <BRK>that might start on sunday  with super bowl xiv at the rose bowl  it promise to be a good show  the embraceable ewe  the cheerleading squad so popular that it ha been featured on  the merv griffin show   will be on the sideline <BRK>one embraceable ewe  jenilee harrison  ha been on  chip  and look enough like suzanne somers that maybe she ll join the cast of  three s company  someday  another is cheryl ladd s stunt double on  charlie s angel  <BRK>ladd  incidentally  is singing the national anthem before the super bowl  and the halftime performance  a usual  should not be missed  the n f l  keep one upping itself  this year it feature up with people <BRK>ah     what a time to be a los angeles ram fan <BRK>postscript   <BRK>on jan        the los angeles ram lost super bowl xiv to the pittsburgh steelers       ray malavasi coached three more season  the ram were      and died in   of a heart attack in a california courthouse  vince ferragamo played in the n f l  until   and won one more playoff game  jenilee harrison  the former ram cheerleader  did join the cast of  three s company  after suzanne somers departed <BRK>in anaheim  behind running back eric dickeron and a string of forgettable quarterback  the ram had some good season but could not keep up with the walsh montana  er  the ram returned to their habit of losing playoff game and fell into relative obscurity in southern california <BRK>in hindsight  the end of day should have been recognized with this team video from the era   ram it  <BRK>georgia frontiere  the remarried owner  moved the ram to st  louis in    they won super bowl xxxiv   year after the los angeles ram lost super bowl xiv <BRK>the use of roman numeral to mark super bowl persists <BRK>frontiere died in    stan kroenke  a minority owner of the team  bought a majority stake from the rosenbloom family and moved the ram back to los angeles in   <BRK>ram crowd at the los angeles coliseum averaged       th in the n f l  and about three quarter of the stadium s capacity  the ram are building a stadium on the site of hollywood park in inglewood  it is scheduled for completion in   <BRK>on monday  six day before the first los angeles ram super bowl in   year  article about the lakers and the dodger got more online traffic for the los angeles time than article about the ram <BRK>ram quarterback jared goff wear no     just like the winning quarterback  tom jarrett  in  heaven can wait   in real life  he look more like ryan gosling than warren beatty <BRK>john branch is a sport reporter  he won the   pulitzer prize for feature writing for  snow fall   a story about a deadly avalanche in wahington state  and wa also a finalist for the prize in      johnbranchnyt <BRK><BRK>
