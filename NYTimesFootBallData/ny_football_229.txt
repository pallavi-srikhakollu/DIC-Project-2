<BRK><BRK>by reuters<BRK>manchester  england   there are great goal  lucky goal  own goal  winning goal and now  in the era of var  we have the  provisional goal  <BRK>no game ha so far highlighted the new situation more than wednesday s extraordinary champion league match between manchester city and tottenham hotspur <BRK>a late winner from raheem sterling sent the etihad stadium into delirious celebration and city manager pep guardiola raced up and down the touchline  leaping into the air  punching the sky in wild jubilation <BRK>city thought were in the semi final of europe s premier competition and their outlandish dream of a quadruple of title wa still very much alive <BRK>then    a turkish referee cuneyt cakir signalled the goal had been over ruled following video review    guardiola fell to his knee  head in hand  in utter despair <BRK>the spur player who had moment before been on their knee  dejectedly acknowledging their exit from the competition  were suddenly resurrected  embracing in the knowledge that they  not city  were heading to a last four clash with ajax amsterdam <BRK>the new system worked  it did what it wa introduced to do <BRK> var wa   percent correct in it decision making  everyone thought it wa a goal  the change in emotion in a split second wa incredible to see   said former spur captain gary mabbutt <BRK>so  instead of television studio discussing how sergio aguero had been offside before he crossed to sterling to complete a famous hat trick and rather than spur bos mauricio pochettino trying to watch his word while lamenting such an injustice  var ensured the correct decision wa eventually made <BRK>distraught city fan  who had not seen the replay  turned to journalist in the press box  to ask whether it wa the right call <BRK>yes  they were told  aguero wa indeed offside <BRK>end of story  no bitterness  no hate campaign against the referee  no decade long sense of injustice <BRK>last minute winner <BRK>and yet  for all the drama of those minute and the accuracy of the final verdict  it wa also hard not to wonder how city fan  or any other team s supporter  will ever be able to celebrate a last minute winner with such wild abandon again <BRK>sure  a long range thunderbolt is unlikely to need a review  nor would a curling free kick into the top corner  <BRK>but any situation where offside might be a factor  or handball  or a push in the penalty area and fan are going to want wait to see if the dreaded tv signal from the referee is displayed before they are sure the game ha been won <BRK>we are now in the era of the provisional goal <BRK>it is something that nfl fan have become used to    the partial celebration before the wait for confirmation  then either a second celebration  without the spontaneity of the original  or the deflating over rule <BRK>spur manager mauricio pochettino ha been one of the few boss to question whether the technology is a risk to the spirit of the game and to his credit  he still maintained a degree of scepticism even after his team benefited so much from var <BRK> the decision to include var in football is going to change the game a little bit  i am pro the basis and trying to help the referee and maybe one year ago i wa a little bit worried   he said  <BRK> today my feeling is the same  when it is for you you need to accept  when it is against you  you need to accept  <BRK>english fan will have to get used to the provisional goal experience a var will be introduced in the premier league next seaon <BRK>on the evidence so far    it will reduce the number of unjust goal  help get more decision right and will inject it own drama into the game <BRK>but it will be fascinating to see how fan  player and coach react to goal <BRK>will they modify their behaviour and hold back their emotion  waiting for the ultimate verdict <BRK>or will they  like city and spur fan on wednesday  commit themselves to the torturous wave of emotion var can provide <BRK>  reporting simon evans  editing toby davis <BRK><BRK>
