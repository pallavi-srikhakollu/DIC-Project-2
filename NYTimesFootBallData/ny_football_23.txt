<BRK><BRK>on pro football<BRK>by ken belson<BRK>kansa city  mo    the n f l  this seaon finally appeared to have accomplished it goal of  getting back to football  after several year of off field turmoil that ranged from player misconduct to weekly protest during the national anthem  but the league s bounce back seaon wa knocked off stride on sunday  a official in the two conference championship game made baffling  controversial call that to some degree overshadowed the otherwise thrilling matchup <BRK>the call   or noncall   left legion of fan feeling their team had been robbed of a chance to advance to the super bowl  and left others simply confused  once again  the conversation monday focused a much on the meaning of penalty like roughing the paser and pas interference   and why they were or weren t called   a it did about the outcome of the game themselves <BRK>the officiating uproar may lead to even more rule change  video review and coach  challenge  those could make game even longer despite the league s professed goal of cutting down stoppage  and another debate is likely to ensue about the use of technology  which sometimes fails to provide the closure it promise <BRK>the most glaring incident   the one that will be talked about for year  occurred in new orleans  where the saint were playing the los angeles ram in the n f c  championship game  late in the fourth quarter  with the score tied and the saint deep in los angeles territory and threatening to take the lead  ram cornerback nickell robey coleman drilled saint receiver tommylee lewis well before the ball arrived  the referee could have called a penalty for pas interference or for a helmet to helmet hit  but they called neither  judgment call like pas interference are not subject to video review <BRK>the saint were forced to immediately settle for a field goal  leaving enough time on the clock for the ram to march down the field and kick a field goal of their own that sent the game into overtime  the ram ended up winning      <BRK> it wa simple  they blew the call   saint coach sean payton said after the game  he had spoken to the league office  he said  and official there had admitted a much to him <BRK>even robey coleman admitted that  having been beaten on the play  he targeted lewis instead of the ball and deserved to be penalized <BRK> i felt more than lucky  i felt blessed   he said <BRK>the a f c  championship game in kansa city got off to a controversy free start  but a the chief battled back from a first half deficit against the new england patriot  another officiating decision  midway through the fourth quarter  brought the game to a halt  it came when the chief appeared to score a touchdown after patriot receiver julian edelman  serving a the team s punt returner  seemed to have touched a punt that kansa city then picked up and took into the end zone  though under the n f l  s rule  the chief would not have been allowed to advance the ball because edelman never truly had possession <BRK>after a lengthy video review  the referee determined that the ball never touched edelman  even though replay suggested that it might have just barely nicked his thumb  the patriot ended up with the ball  taking some momentum away from kansa city  but the chief quickly intercepted a tom brady pas and went on to score a touchdown anyway  still  the ruling the referee wa hard to put aside <BRK>chief fan were also aggrieved a roughing the paser call on a second and   in the fourth quarter after defensive lineman chris jones landed a seemingly innocuous slap on brady s shoulder a he made a throw  a   yard penalty wa enforced  and the patriot went on to score one of the go ahead touchdown that punctuated the lat part of the game <BRK>and finally  after all the controversy  the patriot completed a   play    yard scoring drive in overtime to win the game and move on to the super bowl in atlanta  where they will face the ram  it will be the third straight super bowl for brady and his coach  bill belichick  and their fourth in five season  it will also be their ninth super bowl in the last two decade  with new england winning five of the previous eight <BRK>a exciting a they were  sunday s two game left some fan feeling that aterisks should be affixed to the final score  a sentiment that may tarnish some of the positive sign for the n f l  this seaon  though concussion and health issue remain a simmering concern  television viewership rebounded after two year of decline  merchandise sale have jumped and there were significantly fewer off field controversy compared with recent year <BRK>much of the renewed interest come from a bevy of young star  like quarterback patrick mahomes of the chief  and a bunch of scoring record that fell faster than you can say  brady to edelman  <BRK> last year  the n f l  got past some of their big issue  and people were back to enjoying their team this season   said michael rubin  the founder and executive chairman of fanatic  the league s official online retailer   there s a great class of new player  <BRK>this time last season  the n f l  wa struggling with fallout from the furor created player who were kneeling during the playing of the national anthem to protest racial inequality and allegation of police brutality  in addition to that issue  the owner of the dallas cowboy threatened to sue other owner to stop the commissioner s contract from being extended  and the carolina panther  owner decided to sell his team after a sport illustrated article detailed a culture of sexual harassment at the club <BRK>this season wa not entirely free of such controversy  there wa the release of a security video showing kareem hunt  a star running back on the chief  shoving and kicking a woman  hunt wa suspended indefinitely and then released his team  and the league wa criticized yet again for not doing enough to punish player involved in off field violence <BRK>the scandal did not dominate the season the way similar incident have in previous year  largely because the video wa released toward the end of the season  by then  interest in game had already rebounded <BRK>rubin s company ha been one of the biggest beneficiary  sale of n f l  licensed merchandise at fanatic ha risen   percent this season   about    million <BRK>mahomes had the third best selling jersey  after bear linebacker khalil mack and brady  demand for the mahomes jersey wa so strong there ha been a backlog of order <BRK>other new star goosed sale  too  after quarterback baker mayfield helped cleveland break it long losing streak  sale of brown merchandise soared nearly   time compared with the same week the season before  jersey of two rookie  giant running back saquon barkley and cowboy linebacker leighton vander esch  were also among the top   best selling jersey in the regular season <BRK> there s been an influx of these young guy who have come in and done a nice job   chief coach andy reid said last week   that s great for the game  that s why we re all doing it  <BRK>these  young guy  are one reason average television viewership rose   percent this season compared with a year ago  every network  including espn  nbc  fox and cbs  and every time slot   sunday  monday  thursday   showed improved number <BRK>in addition  team in major medium market including chicago  dallas and los angeles made the playoff this season <BRK>with the saint and the chief now eliminated  the super bowl will offer an intriguing contrast  the fourth youngest team in the league  the ram  who are led a   year old coach  sean mcvay  will face a patriot team that ha made participation in the super bowl almost an annual event  and then there is the fact that brady is actually nine year older than mcvay and that the   year old belichick is more than twice his age <BRK>that should make for great conversation   assuming the referee don t blow any more call <BRK>an earlier version of this article misstated the potential result of a play in sunday s a f c  championship game  if official had ruled that new england s julian edelman touched a punted ball without actually possessing it  the kansa city chief would have gained possession  but they would not have scored a touchdown <BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK>
