<BRK><BRK>on pro football<BRK>by ben shpigel<BRK>kansa city  mo    the last time the chief hosted the indianapolis colt in the playoff  the day broke sunny and mild  with barely a breeze  on his drive to arrowhead stadium that january morning in    kansa city quarterback trent green  hoping that a rainy chill would greet the visitor from a domed stadium  rued the weather <BRK> i knew we would have to score a bunch of point   green said <BRK>the chief  the highest scoring team in the n f l   did     a nick above their season average  and never punted  neither  though  did the colt  with peyton manning operating in ideal condition  they scored   <BRK>if what s pat is prologue  especially for a franchise with a postseaon ledger a ghatly a kansa city s  then the chief who will face indianapolis in the divisional round on saturday at arrowhead are at risk of continuing a trend that doomed them   year ago <BRK>the team that wrecked the n f l  with an offense so potent that it recalibrated how football is played in     scoring the most point and gaining the most yard and throwing the most touchdown   also fielded one of the worst defense that ha ever made the playoff <BRK> read our prediction for the divisional round  <BRK>the chief  defense finished last or second to last in passing yard        total yard       and yard per rush        the chief gave up the most first down ever  with    and though they ranked  th in point ceded  with    only three other team since    when the playoff expanded to include six team from each conference  gave up that many and still advanced to the postseason <BRK>according to pro football reference  only   of the other   team to reach the playoff since   have fared worse than the chief in at least one of those statistical category  including green s group from the   season  which allowed     yard per carry  aside from kansa city  the only others to earn a no    seed were green bay and new england in    and neither won the super bowl  in fact  only one of the     excluding the   ram  who allowed the most yard per rush this season   won a championship  the   colt  whose strong pas defense offset their generosity against the run <BRK>plus  they had that manning guy <BRK>the chief have a guy  too   patrick mahomes   and that s a pretty strong counterargument  but it s not an impenetrable one  a loss to the charger  kansa city led   with le than nine minute left  and the seahawks  seattle ran for   yard  proved <BRK>it s difficult identifying a historical analogue to the   chief  a team of such extreme  the closest might be the   packer  whose leading receiver  greg jennings  recognized the similarity at once  like the chief  green bay created a load of turnover   a league high     while also scoring the most point  the packer also gave up more passing yard and total yard than kansa city did this season <BRK> the defense recognized it more than even we did a an offense   jennings  now an analyst for fox  said of the imbalance   what needed to be done wa what we did  we recognized it and we had to make up for it  <BRK>the packer went     before sputtering in their first playoff game  against the giant  whose offensive coordinator  kevin gilbride  a could be expected  cared only about green bay s scheme and personnel and not it defensive ranking  he said those were skewed all the yardage they allowed when leading  three week after exploiting the packer  blitz  the giant sustained long drive that  were almost a important a scoring   gilbride said  to batter new england s defense in the super bowl  both defense  he said  outclased the chief  <BRK> oh  no question   said gilbride  who ha analyzed kansa city s game film a part of his prep work for nbc s broadcats   i think they re vulnerable  <BRK>the chief  for their part  seem aware of their inadequacy  especially in the secondary and at linebacker  gilbride noted how the team s defensive coordinator  bob sutton  ha tried concealing them with deception  mixing coverage scheme or calling more two high safety look  intended to protect them against deep pass <BRK>their strength is their pas rush  which registered   sack  and that just might be their path to glory  this season ha demonstrated that the chief  defense need not always play well   it need to play well only at certain time <BRK>forcing turnover and pressuring the quarterback are more important than preventing yardage  the eagle  super bowl victory against new england offered convincing evidence  the team combined for a single punt  and the game turned on philadelphia s only sack  producing it only takeaway  the chief      loss to the ram this season  in a game with three defensive touchdown  reinforced it <BRK> maybe you re not playing a well a you d like on defense   sutton said   but you know  hey  we can rise up here and we get a stop here and a stop here  our offense can take care of this  <BRK>the offense ha been so productive that the chief have been ahead for     percent of the time they ve been on the field   and   point  or two possession  more than half that time  they ve played a staggering   defensive snap when leading     more than the next closest team  chicago  according to pro football reference <BRK>when trailing  offense tend to throw more often  and against defense willing to keep the play in front of them conceding yardage  green  an analyst for cbs  characterized sutton s philosophy a  bend don t break   though the chief  defense broke in their playoff loss lat year  allowing three second half touchdown to tennessee  and in their playoff loss two year ago  allowing   rushing yard to pittsburgh but not a touchdown  and in their playoff loss five year ago  allowing   second half point that eraed a     third quarter lead <BRK>that fiasco came against the colt  too  but in indianapolis  reflecting on the chief  flop   year ago  green blamed the offense   he missed some throw  a penalty negated a touchdown  a lost fumble erased priest holmes s   yard run  he emphasized that he never once believed that the defense would constrain them <BRK> we felt we could score on anybody   green said <BRK>same with these chief  they tallied at least   point in   of   game and averaged     at arrowhead  where they closed the season throttling oakland       in a performance that safety eric murray said felt  more cohesive  and  le segmented  <BRK>murray said he wa encouraged  but he will not know for sure until saturday  when the chief embark on a journey that  if it end with confetti falling on them at super bowl liii in atlanta  will have defied nearly   year of statistical trend <BRK>green still life around here  and curious  he checked the game day forecast the other night  snow shower  mid  s    to   m p h  wind  he said he turned to his wife and laughed <BRK> i wa like   why couldn t we have had this weather back then   <BRK>an earlier version of this article misstated the number of time this season the chief have scored at least   point  it is    not   <BRK>follow ben shpigel on twitter   benshpigel <BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK>
