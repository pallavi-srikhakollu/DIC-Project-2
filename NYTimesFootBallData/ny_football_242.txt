<BRK><BRK>by the associated press<BRK>new york   improvement that an nfl and nflpa study found in helmet didn t help tom brady <BRK>the six time super bowl champion quarterback will have to discard his longtime brand a one of   helmet banned the league and player  union for   <BRK>brady wa one of   player wearing helmet last season under a grace period that is now eliminated <BRK> if they were  at the end of the   season  using prohibited helmeted  they could be grandfathered for     said dr  kristy arbogast  the union s appointed consultant to the testing <BRK> at end of    we had those relatively few player     who were wearing a red category model  it is now prohibited  conversation are being held with those player  we tried to identify for every helmet in the red category a similar helmet  often from the same manufacturer  that had similar look and feel and is not prohibited  <BRK>in it annual study  designed nfl  and nflpa appointed biomechanical engineer  a subset of concussion causing impact sustained nfl player during game is simulated to determine which helmet best reduced head impact severity  the study measure rotational velocity and acceleration to evaluate helmet <BRK>a poster both side released friday will be displayed at every team facility  it show six of   helmet tested this year moved into the top   rated model <BRK>vicis zero  graded best for the third straight year  of the   overall helmet on the poster  it wa followed the schutt f  ltd and the riddell speedflex precision diamond <BRK>also in the  green area  of strongly approved helmet wa the brand new xenith shadow  in all  those four manufacturer had all   model at the top of the poster <BRK>the yellow section  in which helmet perform worse than the green group  had seven model <BRK> the thing that s really notable   arbogast said   is how receptive the player were to that info     moved up the poster  they are eager to have the information that help them make informed decision about their equipment choice  <BRK>arbogast commended manufacturer for  innovating and introducing new helmet  the fact all new one performed well is very encouraging  <BRK>the poster includes gray area within the green and yellow sector  that indicates that le than    of nfl player are wearing that model  providing player with additional information  but arbogast stress that  doesn t mean they aren t safe or viable option  <BRK>the   model in the red area  including brady s  are banned <BRK>vicis doubled the number of nfl player using zero  from   to     with   player wearing it last season  among them are league mvp patrick mahomes  super bowl mvp julian edelman  russell wilson  doug baldwin  dee ford and golden tate <BRK> my experience wearing the zero  ha been exceptional   wilson said   the custom fit and wide field of vision have allowed me to perform at my best  <BRK>vicis ha tweaked the helmet  reducing weight and cost while keeping the fundamental design <BRK> the helmet s deformable shell and unique     layer have been shown to reduce impact force more effectively than other helmet   said dave marver  the company s ceo <BRK> the nfl nflpa test rank helmet using a sophisticated formula that considers several different impact velocity and location  and the measurement of both linear and rotational force  the zero  is top ranked when taking all of those measurement into account  meaning it provides the best protection across the full range of impact and situation player encounter in nfl play  <BRK>it ha since the   survey <BRK>one potential concern in the study is that manufacturer could design helmet to rate highly  but they might not necessarily be the best performer on the field <BRK>dr  grant goulet  vice president of product innovation at xenith   which had five model in the green category   noted that  these independent test  whether the nfl and nflpa or virginia tech     are incredibly important and providing value in this space  <BRK> we are very supportive and encouraged the work the nfl and nflpa are putting into this test  it s scientifically rigorous   goulet added   however  it could also be something of a cautionary tale that more helmet moved into that green group  i think there could be a propensity to be engineering helmet for these test and metric and that s what is bumping them up into this green group <BRK> what is important to emphasize is more of a holistic approach to designing the best gear for the athlete on the field  <BRK>that  naturally  is what the entire process is about <BRK> the importance is this is a statistical analysis of on field performance   said dr  jeffrey crandall  the league s consultant to the independent testing   what we see is statistically is double digit concussion risk deduction a we go from yellow to green and from red to yellow  that ha a significant impact on the risk of concussion  <BRK>___<BRK><BRK>
