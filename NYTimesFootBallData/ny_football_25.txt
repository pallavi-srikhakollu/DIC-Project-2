<BRK><BRK>on pro football<BRK>by ken belson<BRK>the number of minority coach in the n f l  is likely to fall half next season  suggesting that the league s recent effort to promote diversity in hiring are still a work in progress <BRK>two week after the end of the regular season  nearly every new head coach hired ha been white  which is certain to reignite the debate over whether a league in which roughly three quarter of the player are black is doing enough to promote people of color into position of power <BRK>this season  there were eight minority coach  tied for the most ever  yet among eight coach who have lost their job  including those fired midseason  five were black  leaving just three minority coach   two black and one latino   among the   coach in the league <BRK>thus far  six out of the seven coach hired team have been white <BRK>the sudden reversal of fortune for minority coach come after the   n f l  owner announced in december that they were strengthening rule that obligate team to consider minority candidate when hiring coach and executive <BRK>at the time  the league denied that it amended the so called rooney rule  named for dan rooney  the late owner of the pittsburgh steelers  who championed it creation in    because it wa not effective enough  the rule requires team to interview at least one minority candidate in their search for new coach <BRK>the n f l  declined to comment on coach hired this month <BRK>with such a small sample size  big fluctuation can happen when a handful of team have down year  the sudden decline in the number of coach may look startling  but richard lapchick  the director of the institute for diversity and ethic in sport at the university of central florida  said that number is bound to rise again <BRK>lapchick noted that there were a record eight minority coach in   before the total declined only to have it return to a record eight coach last year <BRK> you can t not notice when that number of black coach get fired   he said  but he added that it wa  a part of the natural cycle  of coach getting fired and hired   i definitely think it ha a chance to go up  <BRK>lapchick  who compiles a  racial and gender report card  on the n f l  and other professional sport league  said having eight minority coach in a   team league  is reaonable  rather than comparing the percentage of minority coach to the number of minority player  he us the percentage of people of color in the entire country a a benchmark <BRK>cyrus mehri  the co founder of the fritz pollard alliance  which helped establish the rooney rule and monitor it implementation  said his group cannot tell team which coach to hire  rather  the key is ensuring that team give minority candidate an equal shot at obtaining a job  and this year  every team with an opening ha followed the rule and interviewed at least one and sometimes several minority candidate <BRK> you don t overcome decade of history just snapping your finger  but we have to say the process wa fully followed this year   he said <BRK>mehri is focused on strengthening the pipeline of minority in junior coaching job so the pool of candidate for head coaching spot deepens  he noted the percentage of minority offensive coordinator and quarterback coach is still low  minority account for roughly   percent of n f l  assistant <BRK> we think the league ha a lot of work to do   he said  though  in the long run  we re feeling good where thing are  and what s been accomplished  <BRK>still  the league ha been criticized advocate and former coach  who have said team have been skirting the rule <BRK>last year  it wa not clear that the oakland raider conducted any good faith interview with minority candidate for their vacancy at coach before they ultimately hired jon gruden  who is white <BRK>now that team have started to fill their coaching vacancy this year  the number of minority coach may fall half <BRK>the arizona cardinal replaced steve wilks  who is black  with kliff kingsbury  a college coach  the green bay packer followed choosing matt lafleur a their coach  while the tampa buccaneer hired bruce arians to replace dirk koetter  all three new coach are white <BRK>the cleveland brown followed hiring freddie kitchen  a position coach with the team who is white  he replaced hue jackson  who is black and wa fired during the season <BRK>also last week  the denver bronco replaced vance joseph  who is black  with vic fangio  a longtime defensive coordinator  who is white <BRK>and on monday  the jet hired adam gase  who had been fired the miami dolphin  to take over the team s top spot  gase  who is white  replaced todd bowles  who is black <BRK>the cincinnati bengal  who fired longtime coach marvin lewis  who is black  are reportedly considering hiring zac taylor  who is white <BRK>thus far  the lone exception ha been the dolphin  who are expected to sign brian flores  the linebacker coach of the new england patriot  once his team is eliminated from the playoff <BRK>if flores is hired  he would join anthony lynn of the los angeles charger  mike tomlin of the pittsburgh steelers and ron rivera of the carolina panther a the only minority coach <BRK>there are only a handful of minority general manager a well  reggie mckenzie  who wa named the n f l  executive of the year in    wa fired midseaon the oakland raider  where he wa the chief football executive  ozzie newsome  the first african american general manager in league history  retired after working with the raven since they arrived in baltimore in   <BRK>to be sure  coach are hired and fired for many reason  including most of all  success on the field  for instance  joseph wa     in his two season in denver  while wilks wa     in his one season with the cardinal <BRK>team also change strategic direction  and are increasingly looking for offensive minded coach to match the success of high scoring team in los angeles and kansa city <BRK>some black coach also get other job elsewhere  bowles  for instance  wa quickly hired a the defensive coordinator in tampa <BRK>still  the n f l   where nearly every owner and many top team executive are white  ha battled the perception it doe not do enough to promote minority <BRK>under the new regulation enacted in december  team looking to fill position must interview at least one minority candidate from a list kept the league s career development advisory panel  or a minority candidate not currently working with a team  team also must keep detailed record of who they interview  which is perhaps a response to criticism from minority candidate who say they are routinely called  but not formally interviewed  team trying to do the least possible to fulfill their obligation <BRK>after it wa first established in    the rooney rule appeared to be having an impact  by    eight n f l  team had coach of color  the most to that point  or since <BRK>now  it look like the league ha taken a step back  with the number of minority coach expected to fall to just four <BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK>
