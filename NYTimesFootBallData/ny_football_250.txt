midcentury event like the rise of the first algerian national team  whose player broke away from france even though algeria wa still a colony  to more recent one  like the purchase in   of the french soccer team  paris st  germain  a qatari state run company  <BRK> binding the show together is an exploration of political clout  using soccer to explore the increasing reach of some arab nation  while france s global influence is decreasing   seen in the cultural legitimacy that the sport provides  <BRK>  new arab country are in the game   said the show s curator  aurélie clemente ruiz  on a recent tour of the exhibition   it s not only north africa or the middle east but all of these country from the arabian peninsula   qatar  saudi arabia  the emirate   that are very involved in soccer  and it s a way for them to exist in an international point of view  it s a real soft power and  to them  very useful   <BRK> at the root is the ability of sport to shape perception  for the like of mohammed bin salman  the crown prince of saudi arabia   being associated with global soccer can help divert attention from the international indignation at the killing of a dissident  for sheikh mansour bin zayed al nahyan of abu dhabi  one of the united arab emirate  his ownership and lavish spending on the english team manchester city automatically buy a certain fame and influence  similar reason inform qatar s control of paris st  germain and the country s effort to win the right to host the men s world cup in    <BRK> the exhibition begin looking at how soccer reflected relation between france and arab nation over nearly a century  including in former french colony  it touch on the nejmeh sporting club in lebanon  a team historically known for it player  mixed ethnicity  and

blanc beur   or  black white arab   gave way in   to  blue white red   the color of the french flag  she said the implication wa that the french player were no longer defined skin color but their shared nationality  <BRK>  soccer is the first place many people will begin to accept immigration  to see those of other color a one of their own   m  clemente ruiz said  <BRK> given the subject matter  at least one of the exhibition s backer wa of interest  qatar s tourist board is an official sponsor  so are fifa and the french football federation  which lent a number of archival object to the exhibition  including both of france s world cup trophy   a private lebanese collection also provided numerous loan  including the oldest known photograph of arab playing soccer  from     <BRK> the show doe not kowtow to the sponsor  however  in fact  sometimes it border on mocking qatari influence on soccer  in the penultimate room of the exhibition  the uniform of paris st  germain s superstar  including edinson cavani  kylian mbappé and neymar  are studded with fake jewel  the usual dark blue and black of the jersey transformed into shock of outlandish rainbow color  created the

sometimes narrow focus on north africa and it relationship to france  m  clemente ruiz said that she had been committed to maintaining political neutrality  presenting the fact of arab influence on soccer while withholding any significant judgment  <BRK> yet there are time when the exhibition doe take a political side  such a a section on the palestinian national team that is penned in high  metal fence  or in a room of eight model of qatar s world cup stadium  which feature no mention of complaint about working condition for the thousand of migrant worker who built them  <BRK> the show is composed mostly of document  video  archival photograph and object  but there are some artwork  too  one of them  a two channel video installation  follows zinedine zidane  a french former midfielder of algerian descent  a he play for real madrid in a   match against villarreal   a study of near monatic focus and intensity  splicing together footage from   camera trained on the player   zidane  a  st century portrait   created dougla gordon and philippe parreno  is a worshipful portrait of one of the most talented french player of all time  ultimately placing an arab descended individual at the center of french history and celebrity  <BRK> the video brings a spiritual apect to a sport that is increaingly defined money and politics  mr  zidane wa a player whose rare talent largely kept him from being used a a political pawn  the child of immigrant who moved to france while algeria wa under colonial rule  after the world cup win in    jacques chirac  then the president
