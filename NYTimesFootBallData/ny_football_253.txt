 <BRK>  <BRK> when the commercial come on during the game  at least you ll know jason bateman is trying to sell you something   <BRK> by sheila marikar <BRK> m  marikar is a los angeles based writer   <BRK> on sunday  million of american will hunker down in front of the nearest big screen to watch the super bowl and it roster of splashy  celebrity studded advertisement  for brand  it s a crucial stage  in our extremely fragmented medium landscape  there s no better way to reach a crowd  <BRK> cbs is reportedly charging      million to      million for   second of commercial time during the game  and to make that kind of investment worth it  brand pour resource into formulating bit of theater that might get viewer talking  recall budweiser s eye rollingly annoying  whassup  guy and tear jerky clydesdale   the absurd premise advanced this year s roster of super bowl ad are set to include jason bateman operating an elevator  brought to you hyundai   christina applegate tooling around town with a back talking batch of candy  m m   and chance the rapper dancing in an airplane hangar with the backstreet boy  doritos   <BRK> they re fun  they re silly and they re hyped almost a much a the game itself  they re why plenty of non football fan  raising my hand  watch the super bowl  but above all  they re clearly ad  which make them seem almost quaint at a time when advertising ha begun to take on much more subtle   and at time  stealthy   form  <BRK> a   survey the asociation of national advertiser found that   percent of marketer partake in  influencer marketing   the practice of paying people with robust social medium following to promote a product  and   percent of them plan to spend more on it in the next year  company are increaingly targeting user of instagram  the app once dominated photo of baby and brunch  to hype their product  and a influencer marketing and the social network itself have evolved  the line have blurred between sponsored ad  in which a company pay instagram to push an advertisement to user    influencers  tagging thing that they re paid to promote  kim kardahian west posting a selfie with a  flat tummy  smoothie   and regular folk shouting out brand they like  just because  like a friend tagging the design hotel where he stayed during a recent trip to tokyo  compelling me to book a room there when i went to japan   <BRK>  the goal is to get the ad to be a relevant and interesting to you  a a consumer  a the content that you ve elected to follow on your own   said vishal shah  instagram s head of product  <BRK> but the ad are not always obvious  and the people pushing product on instagram may not be a immediately recognizable a the star of super bowl commercial  lat year  johnson   johnson tapped teenage instagram user with around   follower each to promote it latest line of clean   clear product  reaoning that these people would be seen a more trustworthy endorser of the acne combating collection of cleanser and cream than mainstream celebrity who hawk a variety of product  they were  after all  doing thing that other kid responded to authentically   a johnson   johnson representative told adage  <BRK> among company with product to promote and instagram influencers with themselves to promote  authenticity ha become a goal  a thing that people try to reverse engineer either turning the kid next door into a pitchman   in the case of johnson   johnson   or posting what we re supposed to believe are unfiltered account of their daily life  like the makeup guru who post a selfie in her mussed but not messy bed  claiming she  woke up like this   <BRK>  if you re trying to be authentic  definition  you re not authentic   you re manufacturing your online persona   said arianna margulis  the artist behind the instagram baed comic strip but like maybe  it s like  cathy  for millennials and generation z   m  margulis say she follows the guideline laid out the federal trade commission and discloses when she s being paid for a post  she s done advertisement for brand like harper s bazaar  the dating app hinge and pizza hut  but those guideline aren t always clear  and a frequently aked question page on the f t c  s website point to confusion around who qualifies a an influencer and what qualifies a an advertisement  <BRK> take this sample question   if i post a picture of myself to instagram and tag the brand of dress i m wearing  but don t say anything about the brand in my description of the picture  is that an endorsement  and  even if it is an endorsement  wouldn t my follower understand that i only tag the brand of my sponsor    short answer  tagging a brand is an endorsement and may require disclosure  don t assume that your follower know anything   <BRK> m  margulis s line of work ha become so sought after that people who are not paid in money  sneaker  or makeup are claiming sponsorship from brand like nike and sephora in their post so a to  fake it  til they make it  a social medium influencers   they ll caption a post   sponsored   even though they re not sponsored  to either impress their follower or to impress company that they want to get paid   said brian braiker  the editor in chief of the magazine adage  <BRK> so murky is the morass of who s hyping something because they genuinely like it and who s doing it to get paid that  in    the instagram account swearby wa launched to help  smart woman find real and  notsponsored recommendation for the best product around   i first found out about swearby when a beauty editor i follow announced that she had   box of hydrating face mask  lip balm and face cleanser from a luxury skin care brand to give away  would be winner had to follow swearby  follow her  like her post and post a comment naming a product they swear  the post may not have been sponsored  although i wondered who paid for the   box  but it wa an advertisement for many thing  swearby  the luxury skin care brand  and the editor whose opinion carried so much weight that she wa given   box of stuff to give out  <BRK> there s nothing wrong with non celebrity trumpeting product because they like them or touting their accomplishment because want to get more work  but there is something hollow and dystopian about opening an app to see people you like and instead seeing people you like try to sell product to you  a duncan watt  a sociologist and principal researcher at microsoft research  put it   there s a problem when you try to mix friendship with economic transaction   he compared it to how people in relationship don t pay for sex  and you wouldn t normally tip a friend who invite you to their home  <BRK> all smart consumer question the veracity of ad like the one that will appear during the super bowl   doe anyone really think chance and the backstreet boy chop it up over  flamin  hot  chip  but on social medium  we now have to question whether anything we see is actually authentic  <BRK> meanwhile  instagram is making it easier to purchase product through the app  mr  shah intends for the network to become  the world s largest personalized mall   thanks to increasingly smart algorithm  user will see more product they re likely to like  and be able to buy them with a couple of tap of the thumb  at least on super bowl sunday  those who want to avoid being marketed to will know exactly when to get up and refresh their drink or the chip bowl  they just might think twice about refreshing instagram   <BRK> sheila marikar is a los angeles based writer   <BRK> follow the new york time opinion section on
