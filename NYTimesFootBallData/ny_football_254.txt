 <BRK>  <BRK> california today <BRK> by matt stevens <BRK> good morning  <BRK>  here s the sign up  if you don t already get california today email    <BRK> there s been so much california news this week   kamala harris  the l a  teacher  strike   that the los angeles ram  making the super bowl seems a if it slipped under the radar  <BRK> part of the reason may be that while the ram do have a history in los angeles  the team s presence is still new and novel to anyone college age or younger  <BRK>  we are the shiny new toy  but we need to be the favorite toy   kevin demoff  the ram  chief operating officer  told my colleague ken belson when the ram returned to los angeles in     no matter how successful we are  there are going to be challenge   <BRK> they weren t very good at first  but the ram sure are successful now  so i asked mr  belson  our n f l  expert  to outline the challenge that remain  <BRK> matt stevens  for those who aren t close follower of the team  how did the ram go from     in   to     this season   <BRK> ken belson  the turnaround started when the ram hired sean mcvay  in his four plus seaon a ram coach  jeff fisher never had a winning record  mcvay  contrat  is considered an offensive genius  and an unconventional coach  it didn t hurt that the team chose jared goff with the first pick in the draft  and ha aaron donald  the best pas rusher in the game  <BRK> best you can tell though  when the ram take the field on super bowl sunday  will angelenos care  <BRK> winning cure all  and the ram  timing couldn t be better  some fan who never dropped the team remain  younger fan who are just now getting turned on to football in l a  are likely to join the ram bandwagon too  and l a   the theory go  is filled with front runner  which mean many others are starting to root for the team  <BRK> but the city ha not had a team for more than   year  and the raider  who left southern california with the ram after the   season  remain more popular than the ram or the charger  who moved north from san diego   i wrote about this phenomenon a couple of year ago   <BRK> it s worth remembering  too  that the ram moved out of los angeles in   and played in anaheim until    orange county  of course  is very different from los angeles  <BRK> o k   so this is all part of a process  but both the ram and charger will have to fill a giant new stadium      <BRK> yes  right now  both team are selling seat license  which enable fan to buy season ticket  so far  the ram say they ve sold all their most expensive seat license  while the charger say their cheapest seat license are selling well  that should tell you something  <BRK> there s so much television and merchandise revenue shared among all   team  that it s very hard to lose money in the n f l  the issue is really how quickly the ram owner  stan kroenke  can recoup the cost of building the stadium  he need his team to do well so he can get top dollar for ticket  sponsorship and naming right   plus he get a healthy contribution from the charger  <BRK>  a note  we often link to content on site that limit access for nonsubscribers  we appreciate your reading time story  but we
