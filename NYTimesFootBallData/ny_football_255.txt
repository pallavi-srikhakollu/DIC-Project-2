 <BRK>  <BRK> on soccer <BRK> by rory smith <BRK> dortmund  germany   there are time these day when marco reus find himself in the middle of the field at borussia dortmund s signal iduna park  watching a jadon sancho and jacob bruun larsen and achraf hakimi tear around him  a blur of yellow and black  and remembering what it wa like to be young  <BRK> not that reu is what most of u would call old  he is not quite what his peer would call old  either  that is how he feel  though   i am old  my friend   he said   in our buiness  now  when you are   or    you are old   he delivers it with a smile  an acknowledgment that he is hamming it up  jut a little  but the sentiment is real  <BRK> reus feel old in the sense that he is starkly aware that he is no longer young  he know that whenever he see sancho  larsen and the rest of dortmund s shooting star  the way they play with boldness and fearlessness  they look to him like  young horse   wild and free  <BRK> reus know that feeling well  that glorious weightlessness  unencumbered thought of  what will happen later  what happens after you finish   the end so distant that you cannot believe it will ever come  <BRK> he wa like that once  when he wa one of the standard bearer of the new german generation that wa going to lift the world cup in    a winger of pace and cunning and dead eyed finishing  first with borussia mönchengladbach and then a part   a key part   of jürgen klopp s dortmund team  <BRK> he remembers it well enough to know that he no longer ha it  that it ha disappeared at some point along the way  and yet it is hard to conceive of reus a a  veteran   a he put it  partly  that is because he doe not really look the part  his hair is a little darker than it used to be  no longer colored a bright blond  but his face is still smooth skinned  and his voice is still soft  boyish  he hardly fit the stereotype of the grizzled  wizened pro  <BRK> and partly it is because it feel a if reus  even on the cusp of his  th birthday  is still somehow a talent in waiting  his potential not yet fully tapped  for a player regarded a one of europe s best for much of the lat decade  he ha an air of one of the sport s lost boy  <BRK> when dortmund re signed reus   he wa releaed from it youth system a a teenager   after it lat bundesliga title  in    he wa supposed to be the player who lifted the club to the next level  <BRK> klopp believed reus represented a scarcely believable bargain    his real market value is much higher  than the nearly    million he cost  he said   while the dortmund chief executive  han joachim watzke  felt reus might be able to  define an era  for the club  in the way that  uwe seeler did at hamburg and steven gerrard at liverpool   <BRK> franz beckenbauer identified him  along with mario götze  a germany s brightest hope  the two helped dortmund to the   champion league final  reus wa penciled in a a starter in joachim löw s germany team for the   world cup  <BRK> and then    hour before germany wa scheduled to travel to brazil  reus tore his ankle ligament in his final pretournament friendly  he punched the ground in frustration  germany s team flew without him  it came home a month later a the world champion  <BRK> reus did his rehab  returned to fitness  seemed ready to break through into the elite once more  before the european championship in    löw said that reus  hugely enriched  the germany side  but he missed that tournament through injury  too  germany reached the semifinal   <BRK> another recovery  another fresh start  in    ea sport made him the cover star of that year s edition of it fifa game  an honor usually afforded to lionel messi or cristiano ronaldo  that wa the sort of company reus wa expected to keep  dortmund made the german cup final that year  reus  after so many delay  had the first silverware of his career in his grasp  <BRK> he picked up an injury in the first half  at halftime  dortmund s doctor informed him that they believed he had torn his anterior cruciate ligament  and that he would be sidelined for six month  eight month  maybe more  he called his parent  and his girlfriend  scarlett  and cried   it s bad   he told them  dortmund went on to win  <BRK> that evening  reus stopped to talk to reporter  they aked him if he knew the extent of the injury   it is just a little cruciate   he told them  dortmund s communication team wa baffled  there is  they knew  and reus knew  no such thing a a little cruciate injury  <BRK>  negative experience teach you what to say   reus said  explaining how he could be so relaxed  it wa not  though  an act of bravado  he had suffered injury before  setback bad enough that he had once said he would happily trade all of the money he had made during his career for his fitness  <BRK> this injury wa the worst of all of them  and yet it had  he said   caused something in my head to accept it   that is not to say he did not suffer  in the hospital  a couple of day later   once the adrenaline had worn off   reus felt that familiar bleakness setting in  he still had time when he  got emotional  angry  screamed  cried   but he knew that he had to get it out  get over it  get on with it  <BRK>  if it stay inside  you get sad  and you never get to the point where you can make the next step   he said   you can be sad for a couple of day  and nobody will be angry with you  but for week and month  it doe not help   <BRK> he did not  though   not then  not during any of his injury  not during any of the time that he lost   start to feel he wa cursed  he never asked why this wa happening to him  why he had so much snatched away from him  why fate seemed arranged that he would remain a what if  one of those player who never quite becomes   through no fault of his own   what he wa supposed to be  <BRK>  it is human to think about what i have missed   he said   but if i regret too much  think about what i have lost  i lose focus on what i need to do  you cannot rewind  this is not a computer game that you can play again  all i can do is try to be better  to be luckier  next time   <BRK> that is not the only change in perspective injury ha afforded him   you have a lot of time to think about other thing  too   he said  over the eight month of his rehabilitation  reus   his own estimation   grew up   you become aware of what you are doing  and what come next  and when that will start   he said  <BRK> he turn   in may  by that stage  if all go well  he will have become a father for the first time  he is no longer young  even if he is not quite old   i have three or four year left   he said of his playing career   that is still quite a period  but football go fast   <BRK> he ha made no firm decision on what he will do when his career end   he would prefer not to go into senior management  but coach child  if he stay in soccer  because that is when  you should be having the most fun    though he ha a few idea  he ha not forgotten what it is to be footloose  carefree  but that doe not mean he envy sancho  larsen and his other young teammate  he doe not resent the clock for ticking  <BRK>  the injury have taught me to enjoy the time i have on the field  the time i am training with the guy   he said   a you get older  you learn it will end at some point  and so you cherish the moment you are healthy   those young horse are lucky  he know  to feel it will never end  but he would not trade place with them  when you know that time is limited  and time is precious  you appreciate it all the more  <BRK> follow rory
