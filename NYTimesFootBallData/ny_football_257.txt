<BRK><BRK>by sapna maheshwari<BRK>super bowl sunday is the day when the advertising industry is not only tolerated but celebrated  and a in year pat  brand paid million of dollar this year for the opportunity to make consumer laugh  cry and reach for their wallet <BRK>the advertiser for super bowl liii seemed determined to steer clear of controversy for a second year after politically tinged spot stole the show in   <BRK>instead  they offered commercial that championed woman  looked to the future and also inspired nostalgia for the   s   accompanied  of course  a parade of celebrity  cameo included serena williams  jason bateman  cardi b and the backstreet boy  there wa a surprise mash up between bud light and hbo s  game of throne   and burger king relied on vintage footage of andy warhol eating a whopper for it super bowl moment <BRK> follow along with live update and analysis from mercedes benz stadium  <BRK> it seems like there s an awful lot of humor and light appeal  and that for advertiser it s somewhat of a play it safe year   said charles r  taylor  a professor of marketing at the villanova university school of business   we re not hearing about anything crossing over in politics  <BRK>wendy clark  the chief executive of the agency ddb worldwide  said that it wa hard for ad to break through during a quiet game  describing the array a something of a  mishmah  <BRK> i kind of look at some of these and think  some of them are just fine ad   i m just not sure they re super bowl ad   m  clark said   people have perhaps forgotten that yes  you ve got all these eye and attention  but there is still competition for people being around you and talking to you and food and drink and the game itself  <BRK>the talk about trouble for the tv business ha never extended to the super bowl  where the average cost of a   second spot climbed to a cool      million last year  according to kantar medium  it is roughly the same this year  that figure rose   percent in the previous decade  while the average rate for other prime time ad fell   percent  according to the firm  more than   million people were expected to watch the cbs telecast <BRK>bud light ran two spot that got people talking  both featuring it medieval cast of character <BRK>one began with a joust and allowed  game of throne  character  including a dragon  to hijack the spot  ultimately advertising both bud light and the final season of the much loved hbo show  which start on april     ultimately  fan might be thirstier for the show than the beer   the spot tapped into the same show enthusiasm that doritos harnessed last year with an ad that featured morgan freeman and peter dinklage <BRK> if you look at bud light  they ve been in this medieval world  so it s smart on their part to try to get at the love of  game of throne    said liz taylor  chief creative officer of the agency fcb s chicago office  but it s an uncommon type of collaboration  she said <BRK>m  clark of ddb said   no one saw that coming a a  game of throne  ad  and i thought it wa a fantatic and very brave pair up  <BRK>the agency droga   which collaborated with bud light s agency  wieden

unexpected twist from the show killing off the bud knight <BRK>chris spadaccini  hbo s head of marketing  said the network wa looking for a  partner that would be willing to make a bold sacrifice  for the throne   <BRK>earlier  bud light ran a commercial that showed it character receiving a shipment of corn syrup  supposedly meant for either miller lite or coors light  millercoors quickly responded  saying that none of it product contain  any high fructose corn syrup  and that a number of anheuser busch item do  the national corn grower association also expressed disappointment with the company on twitter <BRK> it wa interesting they went for a broad brand play there and actually attacked their competitor   said jon haber  co founder of the ad agency giant spoon   they did it in a funny and cute way   the aim seemed to be to  put that little seed of doubt in there  for consumer in store  who are deciding between the three brand  he said <BRK> pepsi and coke have done it to each other for year   mr  haber said of the jab   it s a tried and true tradition  <BRK>turbotax ran a spot featuring a disconcerting character named  robochild   who wa told that he could not work at the company

capability  <BRK>m  taylor of fcb said   that s kind of the cultural moment that people are tapping into   a i  and robot and tech  <BRK>derek rucker  a professor of marketing at northwestern university s kellogg school of management  said that a advertiser played it safe regarding political message  they seemed to be relying on technology a a way to safely incorporate modern culture into their commercial <BRK> that theme is very present   i can t remember a super bowl that did it at this level   he said   that could go hand in hand   where people want to be creative but don t want to be in any dangerous territory  <BRK>m  taylor wa left feeling slightly underwhelmed <BRK> last year  the ad were really fun and took the pulse of the country and brand used their medium time to bring a sense of hope and inspiration   she said   that s what i m missing so far  <BRK>microsoft aired a tear jerker in the second half  with a spot that showcased a group of child with physical limitation

riffed on the concept of  food porn  for it spot  with a girlfriend discussing her boyfriend s addiction to tantalizing footage of frozen food  ultimately  devour released a more saucy version of it ad online and one that wa deemed appropriate for television <BRK>still  the family approved version may lead to some question from the child in the room <BRK><BRK>
