captain marvel   starring brie larson  became the first film in the marvel movie franchise to focus principally on a woman  in light of this historic moment  we wanted to know  doe the gender of a superhero matter  do we need more female superheroes  <BRK> we asked student and they responded with mixed reaction  an overwhelming majority said  yes  equitable gender representation can have profound societal and personal impact  but others argued that the marvel universe is a business   not an activist group   still others said we have more important thing to worry about than what gender our superheroes are  <BRK> representation matter   we need more female superheroes  <BRK> do we need more female superheros  yes  yes and yes   representation is essential in all form of medium  while i d like to say that i don t factor in thing like gender or race when i look at a character  i do notice those thing  it s nice when a character look like me  or ha similar problem  you connect more to a character when they remind you of yourself  <BRK>   ashley anderson  hoggard high school  nc <BRK> it s been proven that without role for others to look up to  many won t go against the tide  a rule that can be spoken for the same aspect of race and sexuality  seeing people like u in a position of power  success  wealth help u to dream  to learn  without female superheroes  girl wouldn t be encouraged to empower themselves or fellow woman  they wouldn t want to become the superheroes of our society  the lawyer  the police woman  the fire woman  the doctor  when you don t see people that are like you   struggling  flawed  anti heroic   it s difficult to accept who you are  to love yourself for who you are  female superheroes give girl  boy  and everyone in between the knowledge that you can be whoever or whatever you wish  <BRK>   alexandria  lakewood  oh <BRK>   when boy and girl see superhero movie portraying both powerful men and woman  they develop more of a notion that men and woman have equal role in society  this allows them to believe that one group doe not dominate over the other  rather  men and woman can work with each other to better the society in which we live  marvel superhero movie are one step in developing an understanding of woman a resilient  courageous  and positive role model for the general public and for young child and teenager  according to dave itzkoff  the essential change that is beginning to include both gender is  slow but it s happening   through their recent addition of more woman who share quality of brave leader  marvel is helping to create a society where men and woman are both seen a superheroes  <BRK>   francesca  providence  rhode island <BRK> representation is always going to be important in all medium  especially the film indutry  it mean a lot to child to be able to relate to character that they admire  especially superheros  when wonder woman came out  my younger sister were so excited  they hadn t really liked superhero movie before they watched wonder woman  but after i watched them talk about the movie in such an awed and inspired way  even i could feel the effect of seeing someone that i could relate to on screen  we felt empowered  like there wa nothing that could stop u  <BRK>   keira braithwaite  hoggard high <BRK> allowing increased representation for historically disadvantaged group is a vital priority for hollywood during this monumental cultural moment  though it may sound surprising  the entertainment industry s history of discrimination and institutional issue explains marvel s decade long wait to release superhero film that don t focus on white male character  <BRK> a year ago  black panther permanently impacted popular culture with it groundbreaking image of african heroism and massive box office success  similarly  captain marvel will symbolize a long awaited moment of superhero representation  this time for woman rather than african american  if the film becomes another ground breaking success  it could shatter the  fallacy  that  while woman will watch movie about men  men will not watch movie about woman   black panther connected with million of moviegoer  some of whom felt seen like never before and others who were white but still loved the film  <BRK> greater diversity is crucial in all area of medium but marvel is crucially different  the studio ha created some of the biggest blockbuster of the lat ten year  each releae is a seismic  must see event  marvel is in the position of creating image that will empower and influence the current generation of viewer a they follow in the footstep of their favorite character  many people argue that viewer should not focus on the gender and race of fantay character  in    though  representation is still essential  <BRK>   dylan itkin  providence  ri <BRK> i am excited for captain marvel  i know it is going to be a success and i am happy that little girl can go see it and see a strong female role model  what made me mostly happy wa that when i heard the name captain marvel i immediately thought it wa a man  this show breaking gender stereotype in the film industry  <BRK>   mariska  masterman school  philly <BRK> a with most thing  of course woman need more representation in the superhero field  i aked the   people in my house  not including me  who their favorite superhero wa  the answer i got wa what i expected  four people said that their favorite superhero wa a man  well then who wa the only person who named a female superhero  you re probably wondering  that person wa my   year old cousin  who is a boy  even when i gave him no context to my intention  he still said that wonder woman wa his favorite superhero   <BRK> then  i started thinking  if young child are exposed to both male and female superheroes  maybe they could make their own decision  it is not the child s fault if they are not exposed to all gender of superheroes  it s the producer   there is dozen of superhero movie with male lead  and barely any female lead superhero movie  i think this is because superheroes are mostly considered a  boy activity   so they think that a woman superhero will eliminate their prime audience  however  wonder woman made approximately   million dollar in the box office  there is no excuse anymore  and so i think marvel and d c  will continue to make more female lead production  because success is proven  <BRK>   rylee porter  j r masterman  philadelphia <BRK> the gender of a comic character doe not matter but there ha to be diversity  i do believe we need more strong willed female superheroes because they can serve a an inspiration to young girl  captain marvel go through a journey to find who she really is and is sending the message to young girl a well a an older woman  her message is to have other woman know that they are naturally strong and to not listen to those who say that they are  not strong enough  and that they do not  belong  in certain group or area of life  <BRK>   mikhaela  providence <BRK> with the upcoming movie  captain marvel and all the rumor of black widow going around it really doe feel that change is happening in our world for the better  a change that make young girl realize that they don t have to wait for superman when they can be their own hero  <BRK>   audrey e   hoggard high school  wilmington nc <BRK>   but not just any female superheroes <BRK> in previous marvel movie  woman have been treated like accessory  a way to move the plot along for the purpose of a man  black widow  another female superhero  ha never had a stand alone film  even though she s been in the franchise for almost a long a iron man  in previous movie marvel  the woman are often only love interest  and if they are not  they are over sexualized  i think the success of captain marvel will show marvel and other big company  that people will watch female superheroes without them being sexualized or a love interest  captain marvel is my favorite superhero  let alone female superhero  and the reaon behind that is that when i look at her  i see a woman that i can look up to in life for simply being who she is  <BRK>   angela froming  school of the wood  houston  tx <BRK> by over saturating the super hero industry with lack luster  lazy and forgettable woman hero  marvel and other movie studio are making woman super hero look bad  i believe that woman hero are a great addition to any super hero universe   and while i do not believe we have never seen a successful super hero movie that star a woman  the majority of these film are overwhelmingly bad  <BRK> so how should we fix this  i do not propose that we give up this effort  it is much needed for female leadership in a country of mostly male in those position  but there need to be more dignity and thought that go into these movie  the hero herself should be a more well developed  interesting character  the story that surround her should be le corny and cliche  and the time it take to write these movie should be longer  in order to ensure that maximum thought and effort wa poured into creating the most impactful and influential woman hero that they can  <BRK>   ezra lombardi <BRK> i don t feel that the gender of a superhero matter at all  what i think really matter is what the power of the hero are and the hero role  marvel in general ha a lot of very powerful character that are female  for example  in avenger infinity war black widow  scarlet witch and okoye take down proxima midnight  all of the character in this fight seen are woman and have extraordinary role  black widow is an assassin  scarlet witch can pretty much warp reality  okoye is a courageous warrior who ha been called one of the best ever in wakanda and lastly proxima midnight ha superhuman ability like enhanced strength and agility  even though they don t currently have their own movie they play humongous role in the mcu  i think that the captain marvel movie will just push the female superhero role movement over the edge  i think having a movie revolved all around a female superhero is great and i look forward to seeing it in the near future  <BRK>   kenneth r   masterman school  philadelphia <BRK> i believe that captain marvel will be a great representation because it not only a superhero movie  but a movie about a female superhero that ha an interesting story  that is so important because throughout history child look up to superheroes and little girl having a superhero who is a positive role model that s like them  by having a movie with a female lead  it can inspire girl and show them what  female leadership look like   <BRK>   lola adebayo  providence  ri <BRK> i think that a long a a character ha an interesting backstory and an interesting personality they re cool  the gender or race of a character shouldn t matter  if a movie is only created to have minority  female and non white people  it would be boring  it would be tokenism  which is much more offensive than blatant sexism  <BRK>   ami s  masterman  philadelphia <BRK> marvel is in the business of entertainment  not politics  <BRK> i don t understand why people take these movie and blast them to proportion that are way bigger than they should be  comic book movie are made for entertainment  it doesn t matter what kind of character get the movie whether they are black  hispanic  female  or even a norse god  people will often see a movie like  wonder woman  and say that it wa a really big leap for woman when in reality dc wa just making a movie for one of it popular character  the movie said nothing about sexism and it didn t even have that kind of undertone and i think that s what made the movie good  people don t go to the movie for politics they go to the movie to be entertained  it shouldn t matter whether the movie ha a female lead the only thing that should matter is that it s entertaining  <BRK>   wyatt young  hoggard high school <BRK> while it is an ideal to strive for  i believe that marvel hold no moral responsibility towards the compensatory representation of woman in the pursuit of equal gender representation  the entire purpose of their film  and more generally  artistic medium  is to create a meaningful experience and to invoke emotion  not to regurgitate the political climate of the current time  <BRK> a said within the article  there wa a leak from a   email   from isaac perlmutter  the chairman of marvel entertainment  in which he disparaged female superhero film like  supergirl        catwoman      and  elektra      for their poor box office performance   itzkoff   mr  perlmutter s remark might have seemed distateful  but the fact of the matter is that he wa simply doing his job  a ceo of the marvel company  he wa looking out for the best interest of the corporation  <BRK>   andrei mistreanu  hoggard high school  wilmington  nc <BRK> these are buiness  not activist group  what is the avenger without captain america  what is the jutice league without superman  a superhero isn t determined their gender  the time were different when the majority of our beloved superhumans were created  captain america wa created in the   s  captain marvel wa first introduced a the main protagonist in    marvel and dc shouldn t be pressured to star a female jut becaue they are a female  to quote megamind   hero aren t made  they re born   when a superhero is chosen for a movie  they should have proved their merit and have an interesting story  not jut exist a one gender or the other  we do not need more female superhero  we do not need marvel or dc  we do need to let these independent company choose the right person to wow u on the big screen  <BRK>   brian mark  john t hoggard wilmington nc <BRK> i never got why the gender of a superhero mattered  why should it  so why do people make a big deal over gender  whenever i watch a marvel movie  i never think to myself  hey that s a female superhero  or  there need to be more woman   i believe that we should have more female representation  but we re going about this all wrong  one problem is the hype around the movie just because she s a woman  marvel is likely doing this just for money  they hold back on female representation so that when they finally release a movie focused on a woman  people go nut and turn up just to support the character being a woman   instead of focusing everything on female character  focus if the movie is good or not  it will do so much more for female representation in superhero movie to just make a good movie  <BRK>   keegan butler  danvers ma <BRK> woman and girl have more important work to do  <BRK> to be frank  i think this is a topic that ha been blown out of proportion  there are so many other way that woman  the one in real life  not the imaginary one in comic  are being discriminated against  woman make about   cent to a man dollar and we a a whole country have problem respecting woman  even with the metoo movement  catcalling and sexual harasment are still huge issue plaguing american woman  being represented in superhero movie is at the bottom of my to do list a a blooming feminist  first  let s get equal pay and learn to respect woman s choice regarding their own body  among other thing  then we can worry about how many female superhero movie there are in comparison to male  <BRK>   angela xhori  julia r  masterman  philadelphia <BRK> the  ultimate superhero  <BRK> when i think about the  ultimate superhero   i only think about my mother  superheros are known to have honorable quality  they are selfless people  and to me  so are mother  most woman only give of themselves  they give birth  become mother  raise family  etc  they in fact spend so much time taking care of others  they find no time taking care of themselves  although mother might not stop an oncoming villain  they do protect  and raise those of our future  which to me is no different  <BRK> my mother ha alway been there for me no matter how  moody  i get  i remember talking back to her constantly about cleaning my room and despite my hateful attitude she never gave up  she alway showed grace  she pushed me to not only clean my room  but to take care of my thing  which ha later benefited me in many way  she pushed me to reach out of my  villain  costume  and find my inner hero  <BRK>   without mother  we wouldn t have a future  they raise and produce  our next generation  they make  and save life everywhere  with or without a cape  they are the real hero s  <BRK>   isabella clucas  hoggard high school  wilmington nc <BRK> __________ <BRK>  there they were  having fun without me   college student hallie reed writes in  they left me out  and i saw it all   an essay about the time she found out all her friend were hanging out without her  in this student opinion question  we asked student if they ve ever had an experience like this and  if so  how they dealt with it  <BRK> after reading over   comment  we found out that m  reed is not alone  many student had a painful story to tell about being excluded  whether it wa a memory from first grade or a slight that stung just last week  below  their story   of being left out  of doing the leaving out themelves  and of learning hard but useful lesson from the experience  <BRK> it hurt  <BRK> statistic show how social medium can even increase level in anxiety and depression which in my opinion  is very accurate  it s hard not to feel even a little disappointed when you re scrolling and you see a picture of a group of people from your school  smiling left to right  then you look around to see your lonely room and you can compare yourself to the people on the internet  <BRK>   audrey e   hoggard high school  wilmington nc  <BRK> my usual friday night are absolutely miserable  i usually spend it sitting on my bed reading or stuck in my bedroom fiddling with my robot  i spend these night alone  kept company my mind solely  but that s not the miserable part  being alone is something that i have become used to  and started to take a liking to  the bad part is when my parent ask what my friend are doing  and i am always forced to respond with  i don t know   in their voice and face after i say that  i see  hear  and feel sadness  and it seeps into my mind  it make me believe that i have no friend  and that i socially amount to nothing  <BRK> when someone else point out your loneliness  it make it   time worse  just recently  i wa a part of a group conversation  a few joke were made that i did not understand at all  and i seemed to be the only one not getting  i realized that they all had a group chat  all   of them  i immediately felt like in their mind  they didn t really consider me a one of them  or at leat not good enough to be on the chat  it made me feel worthless and unimportant  i have not  and do not plan on  making a comment  because what if they said no  or worse  said yes with hesitation  the even slight possibility of social humiliation is enough for me to say nothing  <BRK>   albert  wilhelmy  <BRK> when you tell your friend an idea of having a bonfire in the summer  suddenly your friend had gone ghost  then you watch your friend on social medium at the bonfire  without you  it will make you have an internal feeling of not having anyone  isolation  abandonment  leaving you to assume that you are not good enough to hang with the crew  trying to pretend like you are not bothered the isolation  the feeling of isolation and abandonment will make you think about walking right out of their life all from betrayal  <BRK>   darnasia shield  lakewood oh   <BRK>  bye marta  chiara and ali  i hope you guy have a great weekend   <BRK> these three girl were what i considered best friend for most of my life   come on girl  we are going to be late to get parking space at the beach   my grandpa drove u to the beach on friday afternoon and quickly  this

heart shattered in a million piece becaue i felt like i lost my three best friend  they ruined the only place left that reminded me of my grandfather  we all lost a part of ourselves that day  <BRK>   michelle gargagliano  hoggard high school  wilmington  nc  <BRK> recently  i came to school and met my friend a usual  it wa a monday  and i thought it had been a normal weekend  with no big plan or party  but i wa wrong  my friend came up to me  showing me a video of her and some of our other friend   look   she said   we went bowling on saturday  it wa so much fun   i looked at the video  laughed  and tried to shrug it off  it didn t work  i kept thinking about it  wondering why i wan t invited  i knew i shouldn t dwell on it  but i couldn t let it go  i felt that short moment of sadness that make you feel inferior  i know i have been left out before  and i know i will be many more time in my life  i only hope i will learn to get over it  and cherish having friend  even if i don t spend every weekend with them  <BRK>   emily curtis  hoggard high school  nc  <BRK>  th grade i thought i had found my people  i felt at home   almost like at peace  all wa fine for a while  we d talk all the time  do everything together  but at school only  it never occurred to me that they never invited me to do anything out of school  i had an odd feeling in the back of my mind  suspecting it  but thought nothing of it  fat forward maybe a couple month into the school year  one of the girl in my friend group ha a big birthday party each year  and invite everyone   except me  i never would ve known either  had it not been for snapchat story depicting my so called friend having a great time without me  immediately  i ditched them for other acquaintance i had made  they then became my close friend  who actually valued me a a friend  although it really hurt  i m glad i had this experience with these awful girl  it made me get a good look on society  people being mean for the pure fun of it   what are you gaining  i have bad social anxiety because of this experience  it make keeping relationship hard  but  it s shaped me into a good soul  being the pity friend enables you to be a wonderful friend to people who are worth it  <BRK>   alexandra pechlivanidis  hoggard high school <BRK> i remember one night during my junior year of high school  i wa having a little bit of a depressive episode  i tried to text my best friend since i uually talk to her to distract myself or to ask for advice  she didn t answer my text right away which wa fine  so i opened snapchat and started swiping through people s story  on her story wa a picture of her  her boyfriend  and all of our friend hanging out together at my ex boyfriend s houe for our friend group s annual badminton tournament  i had participated the last few year and nothing bad happened between u at all so i didn t know why i wan t being included  <BRK> i ignored it for a while  i pretended that i wa okay with being cut out of our friend group  i kept this up for a while until i heard them making plan in front of me like i wan t even there for a while  i wandered around on the outside of that friend group before leaving it completely  <BRK>   emma janofsky  nj <BRK> it happened actually two week ago  i wa all myself playing solo on fortnite  i saw my friend list and seeing a lot of people in my friend s list  i noticed that they are all in squad  i wa all myself  until my friend  amit  join my party  i wa so happy until he told me  he had to leave for his girlfriend  i wa myself for the rest of the night  i just can t believe it  and i thought to myself why am i so sad  i waited for amit to join  when he finally did  he did squad with someone else  i wa devastated  and my heart shattered through sadness  <BRK>   andy lee  northbrook <BRK> back when i wa in first grade  i wa left out everybody  and this is no exaggeration  apparently  in the first week of my first grade year  there were uncanny rumor spreading about me  due to this  the kid avoided me like i wa a cockroach  when there wa an upcoming party  they would talk about it excitedly except for me  when the kid were playing soccer  i would have to force my way into the game just to touch the ball  it wa never a good experience  and i wonder even now what i could have done to avoid it  i tried to ignore it  trying to believe that the kid would stop with their nonsense  but in the end  the rumor got worse and worse while the kid would become more distant towards me  the only choice i had wa to tell my parent and teacher so that everything is solved  <BRK> although it did  it took the kid around   month before they finally started accepting me  <BRK>   june lee  glenbrook north high school  <BRK> i do kind of feel like i m being left out of my friend group on a daily basis though  it s a common recurrence that i am ignored or talked over when hanging out with my friend  i m not sure if i m just not talking loud enough or if they don t care enough to listen to what i have to say  i m definitely not exaggerating when i say it happens everyday  several time a day  it s gotten to the point that whenever i do talk and i m talked over or ignored said friend  they apologize and allow me to say what i wa trying to say  they still haven t stopped interrupting or talking over me  but i think they re trying  i don t know  <BRK>   hope  fl <BRK> there wa time in my life where i asked my friend if they wanted to come to my birthday party each one of them said they couldn t come because there were going out of town  and i thought to myself it s not a big deal right    day have passed and today is my birthday and i wa turning    i went on my instagram and i saw a post of my friend and i wan t in the post  the picture wa all of the at one of my friend party  i went into my room and started to cry and it really did hurt really bad to be left out  my tear wouldn t stop and i wa just sad and i cried for hour and eventually i went to sleep  my reaction to when i saw the post i just didn t know what to do and when the day they told me they couldn t go i just told my mom to cancel the party  i wa really upset about it because i never felt this way before  later on that day i just kept thinking and thinking about and i still think about still today then the next day came and it wa monday and i saw all of my friend hanging out so i walked up to them and said how come you guy didn t come to my birthday party  they all said they were sick and i said i thought you guy were out of town so i just told them i know you guy hang out together and if you guy don t want to be my friend anymore or don t want to hang out just tell me instead of lying to me  <BRK>   raelene  california <BRK> a couple year back  i wa extremely introverted  an introvert is a person who get tired from social interaction  or just a follower  i wan t very confident  or strong  i wa baically a pushover  my two close  friend  had left to another school  but there were moment where i felt left out of the conversation or just ignored when we hung out  after they had left to a different middle school  i felt suddenly lost  i found a different group of people  but the leader kept leaving me  and the others followed suit  i found the better side of her  and we became close friend  the entire experience made me stronger a a person  and even still  there are incident where i am still left out most of the time  i get this sick feeling whenever i am left out  i start to wonder if i wa the problem and not my friend  if maybe  they were doing this because i had said something to them  or been mean  i still feel like this almost every day  it is hard to shake off  <BRK>   rose candelaria  oak grove elementary school <BRK> one really bad thing i do is when i am left out  i should put my phone down and not pay attention to those people  but instead i stay on it and kind of stalk those people social medias so i know exactly what i missed out on  i know i shouldn t do that and it just make me more upset about it but i still do it  <BRK>   maddie montanari  mass  <BRK> in the past six month  i felt farther away from my friend than ever  there became a time where instead of hanging at the beach  they wanted spend their time abuing substance and leaving me behind  at first i jut let it be  but once it started affecting our other friend  i decided to call them out on it  it ruined everything  the distance between u became greater and i wa left all alone  these girl had always been my best friend but now i don t think it can ever return to the way it wa  <BRK>   abigail billing  hoggard high school  wilmington  nc <BRK> it s not always what it seems  <BRK> i became super close with two friend during my first year at a new school  we spent numerous weekend together  we spent holiday together  we spent break together  we formed this super close group with each other  and i had never imagined a falling out a a possibility  we began to grow  and we grew in different way  i became very detached from them  i slowly started hanging out with others and isolating myself from them  at the time i did not think anything of it  they started posting on social medium without me  which caused my perspective quickly changed  i grew angry with them  why were they excluding me  did i not get the invite  i questioned their every move  i felt like a detective  i wa trying to find the missing clue  i slowly realized what the missing piece wa  myself  it became apparent that i wa the one causing the separation  i wa the one turning down the invitation  i wa the one not responding to the text  i wa the problem  i decided to try to become a better friend  i wanted to be included again  but a it turn out  i did not want to be included  the time apart caused our friendhip to falter  it wa a if i did not know them anymore  when we get excluded from thing  we need to look at it a an opportunity to examine ourselves  or we can grow and move on  <BRK>   tyler biddulph  lakewood <BRK> when i wa about   year old  one of my close friend had thrown a birthday party  without inviting me  seeing all my close friend having what seemed to be the time of their life  over a snapchat story  gave me immense anxiety  i started thinking that it wa my own fault that i didn t get an invite  when later i had come to find out that the girl parent had got my mailing address wrong when they sent the invitation  i had created this load of anxiety on myself for no reason  i had questioned myself  instead of questioning the source of my anxiety  my close friend  <BRK>   isabella clucas  hoggard high school  wilmington nc <BRK> one of the most memorable moment of my  left outness  actually did not occur because of something i saw on social medium  but literally right in front of my face  two of my best friend were making plan together  and i wan t included  thinking about it now  i ve realized they didn t invite me because of me  it s that they didn t have another ticket to the baeball game  and i don t even enjoy watching baeball that much  even though i ve realized this now  in the moment  i felt terrible honestly  it made me feel sad  and angry  and confused  and a the pasive aggressive and non confrontational person i am  it resulted in me swearing them off in my head and then proceeding to call my mom to pick me up  <BRK>   sara desrocher  massachusetts <BRK> being left out can be one of the worst feeling to experience  i have been left out numerous of time like m  reed  a few time it ha been my own fault for denying the invitation but that wa due to my anxiety holding me back and preventing me from partaking in the activity  but at time i hoped that i received the text  hey want to hang out today   instead i had to find out a different way  i used to open snapchat and see video of the both of them laughing together either in the car  at the pool  trying on dress on or just eating together  one day i confronted them about it and the word  we didn t think you d want to come  hurt more than i expected it to  <BRK>   arendy  providence <BRK> i ve been the one doing the leaving out  <BRK> two summer ago i took a trip to new york and invited two of my closest friend to join me  trut me if i could have taken more i would have becaue it killed me knowing i wa leaving some of my friend out  but the decision had to be made  sometimes you jut can t invite everyone  and it hurt not only the other person  but you  i felt guilty in a sense that i let my friend down  i have the most amazing friend  but our only problem is that there are so many of u and it s a challenge taking everyone everywhere  <BRK>   gracie sistrunk  hoggard high school  wilmington  nc  <BRK> when i need to exclude people i feel really bad about it  personally  i like to take the honest approach and tell them the truth   i m sorry dylan  but my mom said i can only have a few people over    sorry kate  i think just the guy are gonna hang tonight   i know that it stink when people say that you can t go  but it is so much better than getting lied to  when someone tell you that you re not invited somewhere you can get over that relatively quickly  but when you get lied to and excluded then you lose the ability to fully trust your friend  that s the real killer  <BRK>   mike mahoney  ma <BRK> this summer  when i went to   flag new england with my friend for my birthday  my parent had bought   ticket  and so i had to exclude some people from coming  and boy did i feel bad for those who i didn t invite  it wa the first time that i had ever spearheaded an even that a group of u were hanging out and i did not really understand how bad it felt to not invite others  since then  i have become much more lenient to those who don t invite me to event  becaue i realize that it isn t something personal against me  it could be a simple a it skipped their mind  or they weren t allowed to invite many people  covering it up saying they can t hang out i also find understandable  it can be hard to tell someone to their face that they aren t invited to something  <BRK>   keegan butler  danvers <BRK> the sad thing is i ve been on the opposite side of the story sadly  multiple time  i m sure you ve done it without even thinking  birthday party  trip  or even just going out to brunch  i didn t care though  i didn t want this girl to come to my party  she wa in my group at school  but not outside of school  we excluded her a lot  it didn t even phase me until i wa put into that situation  i wa the one getting left out now  i felt what the girl felt pretty much every weekend  i suggest having many friend group  especially if you re in high school  your  friend  drop like fly then  keep a positive mind open and make new friend  that s what i did and now i have multiple friend group and have many chance to hang out with them  <BRK>   piper gallen  hoggard highschool  nc <BRK> on my  th birthday i invited three girl from school over to celebrate and spend the night  we had volleyball the next morning  so it made sense just to keep it easy and invite them  one of my friend from school wa very upset she wa not invited  and she wa very short with me that day  i texted her and explained my reasoning for only inviting those few  she eventually understood  i don t really have birthday party anymore  someone always get left out  <BRK>   olivia britt  hoggard high school  wilmington  nc <BRK> some positive came out of the experience for me  <BRK> being lonely is a choice  life  for anyone  is an endless opportunity of everything and anything  the only thing stopping you is you  you limit yourself  with a positive look and good spirit you can go do anything  in the countless opportunity in life  if you cry and complain about the one you messed  you will miss even more not moving on  <BRK>   cormac  lakewood <BRK> feeling left out not only ha it negative  but also positive  it s hard to swallow  but in some case feeling this way can help you structure your future  everyone ha been left out at least once in their life and would be lying if said otherwise  it is a feeling one hate to feel  but is portrayed differently to me  i have realized quality over quantity within friend is crucial  the more fake people you surround yourself with  the more difficult situation you put yourself in  <BRK>   conor fitzgerald  danvers <BRK>   i realized everyone go through this feeling of being left out  even the one who are doing the leaving out  therefore very recently i have moved past my fear of being left out and not having friend  sometimes you just have to open your eye and realize the people who really are there for you and the one who aren t and just move on  <BRK>   tamsie black  hoggard high school <BRK> it always seems more fun when you aren t there  this is always a crushing feeling to know that you are missing out on possible memory  the next time you see your friend is also odd  but it is important to remain normal about it  if you try to address the situation  it becomes more weird  and then they definitely won t invite you next time  but most of all  it is important to remember that there will be a next time  there will always be another chance to hang out with friend and make memory  even if it isn t with the same group that once left you out  <BRK>   ezra  lombardi <BRK> i used to feel upset and like i wa missing out when i saw what others were doing on social medium  how could someone not feel left out when everyone else is having the time of their life  but when i would go to thing  i realized people put on an act for the camera and it wan t a fun a the post made it seem  i started to grow out of being upset over every little event that i didn t go to  i realized it is totally fine to not attend every party and that everything is not a it seems on social medium  mixing the lack of reality portrayed on social medium and being an overdramatic sensitive teen  fear of missing out is almost impossible to not experience  <BRK>   sommerlyn jones  massachusetts <BRK> freshman year went and i thought that i would never find genuine friend that would actually want to hang out with me  eventually i connected with another person from that same middle school group that felt the same way i felt  i also got back in touch with an old friend from elementary school  those shared feeling and old bond sparked a flame between u and our friendhip blossomed  the tail end of sophomore year and the majority of my junior year ha been the best  friend wise  i went through some feeling of being left out but i waited and puhed through and it paid off  in the end  i m almost happy that i wa left out becaue it forced me to cut some people out of my life and discover my true friend  <BRK>   madison prideaux  boston  mass  <BRK> in reality most of the time they are just hanging around being bored and someone say  it picture time   that s when everybody get up make it look like they are having fun  and then when picture time is over everyone go back to being bored  <BRK>   sidney holman  northbrook  il <BRK> after year of looking on instagram and seeing them hanging out together  and posting it  i knew i had to stop it  i began deleting instagram  i knew that i didn t love the app enough to get hurt every time i opened it  i talked to my mom  who i grew distant from during my time of being hurt and confused  i made new friend and new connection  now  i m happy  although i don t have instagram  i can still have fun and hang out with people who i know will not hurt me  <BRK>   izzy  california <BRK> shortly after getting rid of my social medium account a few year back  i began to realize just how big a role it played in that  in my opinion i think a good remedy to this awful feeling is simply cutting out social medium  if you think about it  you don t start to feel bad until you actually see the post indicating you were left out  now i know this isn t an option for some people  so if you just can t part with your account then maybe spare some other people that no good feeling  by this i mean don t post a picture every time you go out  it s a simple solution and could easily decrease the number of people who feel left out  <BRK>   mia escalera  hoggard high school  wilmington nc

purpose is to show off it luxury or expense  <BRK>   sommerlyn jones  massachusetts <BRK> my dream home would be somewhere in the suburb  a very similar environment to where i live now  i want a big

and relax  <BRK>   madison prideaux  boston  massachusetts <BRK> outdoor paradise <BRK> if i had the ability to have my dream home  i think the   year old in me would come out and i d have water slide everywhere  it would definitely be big and somewhere exotic  and near an ocean that s turquoise so i could overlook it whenever i d want  and i want to be able to run outside and in the next minute  have my foot buried in warm sand  but i also want a garden and a real backyard with grass so everyone can enjoy themselves  <BRK>   sarah khan  providence  ri <BRK> i would love to live on the beach

out my window and see bird around  <BRK>   allison  ma <BRK> location  location  location <BRK> my dream house would be a replica of my self designed minecraft home  naturally  the house would have to

massachusetts <BRK> my dream home  though i love new england  would be located right on a beautiful beach in malibu  california  of course  the beach i would live on would have to have amazing wave
