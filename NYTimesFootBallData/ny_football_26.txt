<BRK><BRK>on college football<BRK>by marc tracy<BRK>millennials were the first generation to make multitaking a religion  hovered over helicopter parent  they   we   were encouraged to see no ceiling to our potential and no limit to our option a we were ferried among school  baketball practice  piano lesson  test prep tutoring and group outing to the movie <BRK> it s not the stick that drive them on  it s the carrot   david brook wrote of the oldest millennials  who were college student in     opportunity lure them  <BRK>but that  it turn out  wa child s play  kyler murray  born in     making him either an extremely young millennial or a member of the emerging generation z   wa already set to go from heisman trophy winning quarterback of oklahoma  a major conference champion  to budding star outfielder for the oakland athletics <BRK>murray added a further twist monday  though  when he announced   how  on twitter  of course    that contrary to expectation he would enter the n f l  draft  despite having received a      million signing bonus with the a s last year  he had been selected with the ninth overall pick in the major league baseball draft on the understanding that this past season would be his last on the gridiron <BRK> i ve always felt like i could play in the n f l    murray said last month   i m a confident guy  <BRK>he added of football   i ve played this game my whole life and i ve always felt like i could do it  <BRK>there are many way murray s pre professional saga could conclude  and it is not at all certain that he will ever suit up for an n f l  team  the league combine is next month  whether murray show up will tell u more about his true intention   it will also tell u more about his true height  which oklahoma list at an already short for an n f l  quarterback   foot   inch  <BRK>murray and his representative met with the a s and a league representative on sunday  according to a source with knowledge of the talk  where it wa established that the a s could offer him a larger  major league contract  murray entered the draft in order to learn more what n f l  front office think of him  the source said <BRK>late lat year  murray and his baeball agent  scott bora  insisted that the plan wa for murray to play one seaon a oklahoma s starter and then report to spring training for the athletics  such a deal wa apparently part of the negotiating process that led to murray s baeball contract  and wa outlined in a news conference lat spring with a s executive <BRK>still  that murray would even entertain the possibility of playing both big league baeball and quarterback on sunday   or would be so self asured of his talent a to make leveraging one against the other a plausible ploy   is something new in american sport <BRK>when bo jackson and deion sander were two sport star two decade ago  they were a running back and a cornerback  those are difference making position  but quarterback they are not <BRK>and in    after charlie ward won the heisman playing quarterback at florida state  he said he would turn to basketball unless he wa picked in the n f l  draft s first round  when he wa not  he embarked on a decade long career in the n b a   mostly with the knicks <BRK>the difference between the two pastime must have seemed blurrier then  free agency wa only dawning in the n f l  many revelation concerning the toll of repeated hit to the head were still year into the future <BRK>nowadays  we know how dangerous football can be  but we also know that young baseball player face many year of some combination of playing in the minor league and making lowish salary under team control before hitting an ostensibly open market into which franchise are seemingly pouring le money every year  all this while franchise quarterback sign deal worth    million a year after finishing rookie contract that are not exactly ungenerous <BRK>football versus baseball  in other word  is not the obvious  clear cut decision that some might have once thought it wa <BRK>it is conceivable that murray will not have to choose  he is frequently projected a a first round n f l  draft pick  and already wa one in baeball  first round pick are among the most valuable asets in both league  and no team in either would knowingly wate one using it on someone with no intention of trying to live up to it <BRK>either way  murray ha already transcended the team first ethos of both sport  exploiting his moment of utmost possibility for all it is worth  this might be the ultimate millennial move  always  always play your card optimally  and you will maximize your accomplishment <BRK>then again  an older person   even an older millennial   might point out that money  fame and glamour are worth only so much  in the long run  we are all running on a treadmill no matter how fast our   yard dash is <BRK>this much we know for sure  should he not withdraw his entry into the n f l  draft  he will irrevocably give up his final season of eligibility in college football <BRK>that is a wholly understandable decision  in college  the pay is lousy  and there is a definite sense that real life is still a thing in the future  but a many a proud alum know  college can be the best  and real life can be overrated <BRK>additional reporting tyler kepner <BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK>
