<BRK>though the sonics were a storied n b a  franchise  with a league championship in    attendance wa down at their seattle arena along with point scored and revenue earned  a the team s lead owner  mr  schultz wa facing unrest from fan and partner alike  at the same time  starbucks  the coffee company he had built into a global giant  wa about to hit a bad patch  too  a the first ripple of the great recession began to rise into a flood tide <BRK>you don t have to be a basketball fan to know which problem mr  schultz wa able to fix <BRK>the sonics no longer exist   sold mr  schultz s group that same pivotal year  and later moved to oklahoma city and renamed  even the memorabilia packed away  now  a mr  schultz mull running for president a an independent candidate  his path through that moment say a lot about him   how he handle adversity and uncertainty  and how he graped or did not the nettle of local politics a the sonics were flailing  according to more than   people who have observed him  befriended him or worked with or against him over the year <BRK>his basketball legacy ha left many in seattle outraged to this day  believing mr  schultz to be either duplicitous or duped others  yet his action at starbucks   including a raft of innovation introduced before and during the recession  like health insurance for baristas   became the stuff of adoring harvard business school case study  in fortune magazine s ranking  starbucks is the fifth most admired company in the world <BRK>the common thread   deeply familiar to people in the city mr  schultz ha called home since the early  s  and now echoed in his talk of entering politics   is a kind of idealistic righteousness  combined with obvious conviction about his own ability and insight  all of which worked like a magic wand in seattle  except when it didn t <BRK> there s no question that he built an amazing business  one that seattle ha benefited from and one that ha worldwide reach   said greg nickel  a democrat who wa in his second term a seattle s mayor in   <BRK> the sonics episode  i think  wa different   mr  nickel added   i think he got into it and discovered it wa not what he thought it wa going to be  <BRK>mr  schultz     a self made billionaire who grew up in public housing in brooklyn  said in an interview   conducted  at his request  in a starbucks   that he had not decided whether to seek the white house and had set no deadline for doing so  a self described  lifelong democrat   mr  schultz said that he thought the democrat were veering too far left  president trump and the republican too far right  and that there wa a hunger for a more centrist candidacy like the one he might put up <BRK>but he also said  a he had repeatedly in recent speech around the nation promoting a new memoir  that he would not run if he became convinced his candidacy could aid in mr  trump s re election <BRK>indeed  his announcement in january that he wa  seriously  considering running brought an outcry from many democrat who feared a split vote  the president chimed in  tweeting that mr  schultz  who had never sought public office   doesn t have the  gut    and warren buffett called a schultz candidacy  a mistake  <BRK>a a rule in american politics  independent fail to get elected  since the civil war  only four minor party candidate for president have mustered at leat   percent of the vote  ross perot  george wallace  robert la follette and theodore roosevelt  roosevelt  a republican turned bull moose candidate in the   election  couldn t win despite having been a popular president only a few year earlier  but even getting le than   percent can make a difference  a ralph nader showed in the   election  which put george w  bush in the white house through an electoral college victory even though al gore  the outgoing vice president  won the popular vote <BRK>for his part  mr  schultz belief that an independent president could have a powerful mandate in governing  a a refutation voter of the bitter and divisive  politics of revenge  that have paralyzed wahington  the example that it could be done would  in turn  draw out a surge of like minded independent candidate who would reshape congress  he added <BRK> the current trajectory we re on demonstrates such evidence of a broken system   mr  schultz said   i m looking at the situation and realizing that a large majority of american agree with me  <BRK>if mr  schultz doe run  his seattle experience  combined with a back story of self made success  would be the narrative he tell and sell  starbucks started here  and is a different company  mr  schultz said  because of the culture that defines the pacific northwest  the sonics failed here and were a seattle story  too  for which mr  schultz ha apologized  in his universe  it s a venti size place of success and failure <BRK>when mr  schultz organized an investor group to buy the supersonics in    he took the high road of rhetoric  sounding like a civic patron out only for the city he loved   with the grubby business of moneymaking very much an afterthought   he promised to treat the team a a kind of sacred civic trust <BRK> this ownership group did not get involved to make a profit   he said at one point in testifying before washington state legislature   we wanted passionate people  about not only sport  but passionate people about our community  <BRK>that language and imagery came back to haunt him in the aftermath of the team s demise <BRK> schultz became a pariah   said gary washburn  a former seattle sportswriter who now cover the n b a  for the boston globe <BRK>in february    mr  schultz drove to the state capitol in olympia  plunked down in front a microphone in a wood paneled senate meeting room and repeated what some considered a threat   that he might have to sell the sonics if he didn t get more than    million in public money for renovation to their arena <BRK>he said the sonics were losing money because they had a terrible  uncompetitive arena lacking in the profitable add ons that other franchise had  like restaurant and store  public money had been lavished on other sport in seattle in past year  he pointed out   with new play space for the mariner  a baseball team  and the seahawks  a football team  it wa time to bestow some love on the n b a   mr  schultz said <BRK>it did not go well  the sonics bailout bill did not even come up for a final vote  the political appeal of financing athletic venue had faded after the   dot com economic bust  and a ballot meaure aimed at reducing taxpayer money in professional sport wa gaining favor even a mr  schultz testified  initiative    a it wa called  wa approved that fall a   percent majority <BRK>several people who were in the legislature at the time said that mr  schultz  who had never been very involved in politics or lobbying  wa treated like the outsider he wa  and never appeared to understand the network of informal alliance that stood in his way  call were coming to legislative office from people connected to the city s other sport team  saying they didn t much like the idea of financing a lot of expensive new skybox seat <BRK> the mariner and seahawks people were not terribly encouraging   they had several back channel  and sort of front channel of stuff going on   said james mcintire  a democratic state representative at the time who later served two term a state treaurer <BRK>art thiel  a longtime columnist and sportwriter who covered the sonics story  said mr  schultz simply didn t understand the state capital   he thought that he could do a a pro sport owner the same sort of thing that he could do a a successful business owner  which is either to charm the opposition or bully them   he said   he got neither done  <BRK>barely five month after hitting a wall at the legislature  mr  schultz made good on his warning  announcing that he and his co owner had sold the team to a group based in oklahoma  which moved it and renamed it the thunder <BRK>mr  schultz now call that decision one of the major regret of his life <BRK> my biggest mistake still reverberates   mr  schultz wrote in a recent op ed piece in the seattle time  in his book  he elaborates on what happened   almost everyone blamed me  and after some initial denial  i realized they were right to do so  i had squandered the very public trust that i had bought into  <BRK>a longtime friend of mr  schultz s  howard behar  a former vice president at starbucks  said that while mr  schultz learned from the experience  he had been warned in advance that straying from the world he knew might be dangerous <BRK> when he bought that company  i had a quote in the local newspaper in seattle  i said   no good will come from this   i think he s nut    mr  behar recalled   and i wa right  no good came from it  <BRK>the storied name of the seattle business world roll off the tongue all over the world  amazon  boeing  eddie bauer  microsoft  rei  starbucks  and just a microsoft is asociated with it co founder  bill gate and paul allen  and amazon with it founder  jeff bezos  mr  schultz is mr  coffee  father of the frappuccino and coffee size in butchered italian   the  venti   for extra large  which just mean     in italian  is a nod to the espresso culture mr  schultz fell in love with on a trip to italy in    <BRK>mr  schultz  who handed off leadership rein at the company lat year  came to seattle with his wife  sheri  in    to take a job a marketing director of starbucks  then just a modest local seller of coffee bean  only five year later he organized an investor group to buy the company  and then built it   with two stint a chief executive   into a retail giant with nearly     store around the world and more than     employee <BRK>but like seattle itelf  with it vast wealth and abundant homelessness  it left leaning social and environmental policy but no income tax on it considerable allotment of billionaire  the schultz legacy is mixed <BRK>at his first seattle appearance after announcing his presidential consideration  protester gathered outside a downtown theater where he wa promoting his new memoir  the protester waved sign about  venti ego  and failed billionaire politician  while the audience inside cheered at almost every whispered hint of a presidential run <BRK>in charitable civic work  the schultz family foundation ha been a force in homeless advocacy  working with shelter group and youth training center in seattle  with a data driven approach to moving homeless family off the street quickly and into stable housing <BRK> the foundation piloted something and proved that it worked   said marty hartman  the executive director at mary s place  a nonprofit shelter provider that ha received more than      million from starbucks and the schultz foundation <BRK>but other meaure of civic engagement  like bothering to vote  mr  schultz ha been le involved  of   election held since   that he could have participated in a a seattle resident  he voted only   time  according to king county record <BRK> i m remiss  of course  that i did not vote in those local election  but you know i travel so much   mr  schultz said in the interview   though he quickly added that he had never missed a chance to vote for president <BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK>
