<BRK><BRK>by kevin draper<BRK>atlanta   after the n f l  s best season in year  roger goodell  the league s commissioner  got his chance to crow on wednesday afternoon ahead of it showcase event <BRK> this season ha demonstrated that there ha never been a better time to be a part of the n f l    goodell said   our game is getting better and better  and our engagement and popularity is unmatched in today s medium landscape  <BRK>under goodell  the n f l  ha tried to be everywhere all the time  the combine  the draft and the minicamps have become manufactured event unto themselves  there are now game on thursday night and some  played in london  early on sunday morning  and most game have remained on network television even a other sport have largely moved their game to cable and now streaming <BRK>a year ago  the strategy wa under stress  then the emergence of a new crop of young star and a largely controversy free season combined to drive up television rating and produce a spectacular weekend of conference championship  capping a winning streak that began with a surprisingly fervent auction for right to the league s least popular slate of game <BRK>coming off the   season  after television rating had dropped   percent over the previous two year  the league entered the medium market trying to sell the right to  thursday night football   cbs and nbc had both said they lost money showing thursday game  and they weren t willing to pay much more than the    million combined they were paying each year <BRK>then  a in    when an audacious bid for n f l  right ignited a scramble that sent their value soaring  rupert murdoch came to the rescue  fox agreed to pay    million annually to show  thursday night football  <BRK>murdoch s market resetting bid came shortly after he agreed to sell the vast majority of his empire to disney  leaving him with a significant need for marquee programming on his network  also  there wa real competition from a tech company <BRK>brian rolapp  the n f l  s chief medium and business officer  said in an interview in september that fox did not submit the highest bid  a tech company did  he said  though he would not reveal which one <BRK> we turned down higher bid   he said   when you put a game excluively on digital  are you growing the distribution and availability  or are you limiting it  and to the extent how much  and for u  we weren t sure we wanted to do that yet  <BRK>in other word  the n f l  stuck to it foundational game plan to be everywhere and accessible  after two season of turmoil  the league opted not to break away from it longstanding strategy  but instead doubled down on it <BRK>plenty of danger still lurk  football s concussion crisis threatens the viability of youth football  colin kaepernick s collusion case against the league drag on  suggesting he ha a chance to win  and attendance wa down to it lowest level in eight season  instead of patriot quarterback tom brady or ram coach sean mcvay  the biggest topic ahead of the super bowl remains atrocious officiating  the league s collective bargaining agreement with it player expires in two year  and negotiation will be tough <BRK>but rolapp s big bet paid off  every time slot for n f l  game  including thursday night s  earned higher television rating this season  a total gain of   percent <BRK>incident of violence against woman continued to plague the league  the kansa city chief cut the pro bowl running back kareem hunt during the season after video showed him shoving and kicking a woman  the new york time later reported that the n f l  failed to question hunt about the incident during an interview earlier in the year <BRK>the san francisco  er cut reuben foster after his second arrest on domestic violence charge in    and three day later he wa claimed wahington  a move that garnered substantial criticism  tmz also published video of wahington safety montae nicholson punching out a man <BRK>but goodell and the n f l  limited their unforced error  there wa nothing like the drawn out legal battle over deflated football in   and    and once the n f l  realized the opposition it would face if it pushed ahead with a rule mandating player on the field to stand during the national anthem  the league backed off <BRK>young player like patrick mahomes  baker mayfield  mitchell trubisky and saquon barkley became star in    pointing the way to a post brady world  high profile quarterback like russell wilson and andrew luck returned to form  high octane passing offense took over the league <BRK>it all came together in the conference championship game  which featured the four highest seed and the four highest scoring team  two veteran quarterback  drew brees and brady  took on the best young quarterback  jared goff and mahomes  in high scoring shootout that went to overtime <BRK>david berson  the president of cbs sport  which will televise the super bowl on sunday  said fewer off the field story were getting attention  because the on field product is so compelling   whether berson is correct or whether the league simply had a year with fewer controversy ultimately doe not matter all that much to the league s medium partner because  a berson put it   the focus is on the football  and the football is really exciting  <BRK>there were blown call and rule controversy  of course  the n f c  championship game hinged on an egregious no call  and brady and the patriot also benefited from a questionable ruling and a rule that did not allow mahomes   probably the league s most valuable player   to get his hand on the football in overtime  but the argument garnered more attention for the game  which wa just what the league wanted <BRK>the question now is whether this fundamentally violent sport can be made safer  before the seaon  the n f l  introduced a rule barring player from using their helmet a weapon when tackling  six week into the seaon  it enforcement wa essentially abandoned  underscoring how difficult it is to legislate between acceptable and unacceptable level of violence <BRK>according to league statistic  concussion were down   percent in    to     per game from      jeff miller  the n f l  s executive vice president for health and safety  cautioned on a recent conference call that  there is no finishing line  when it come to player safety  but touted the work being done to get player to wear better helmet and to present team with targeted intervention to prevent concussion <BRK>the league s own concussion data show that the number of concussion each year fluctuates  and that previous reduction were reversed in following season  the n f l  ha also not been able to reduce the instance of a c l  and m c l  tear  ligament injury that commonly end player  season <BRK>the youth tackle football participation rate ha been dropping for a decade  and now the high school tackle football participation rate is declining  too  just one insurance company is willing to cover professional football league for head trauma  according to espn  and youth football league and school district are facing insurance premium that they are struggling to afford <BRK>in the off season  the n f l  is likely to receive a ruling in the kaepernick collusion case  his grievance  which wa filed   month ago  still hasn t been heard  it remains difficult for collusion to be proven  but if kaepernick win  he could be awarded ten of million of dollar  and evidence uncovered in discovery and deposition could become public <BRK>attendance in   fell to it lowest level since    this drop will be rectified in part in   when the los angeles charger move from a     capacity soccer stadium to a     capacity football stadium  but washington  tampa bay and cincinnati all suffered big drop <BRK>the n f l  operates on two plane  the day to day of small crisis and opportunity  and the issue that could take a bite out of the    billion a year league  most thing fall into the first bucket  with no chance of harming a league whose revenue inch upward each season because of television contract signed earlier in this decade <BRK>over the next decade  the n f l  s ability to handle the changing medium and technology environment and the mounting health and safety challenge is likely to determine whether it reach it goal of    billion a year in revenue   and remains at the pinnacle of american sport <BRK>arthur blank  the owner of the atlanta falcon  is confident the league will continue to prosper  he belief the n f l  will receive even more money when contract to telecast sunday and monday game expire after the   and   season because of  the number of way the product is distributed these day   he said <BRK>but the root of blank s confidence is the league s longstanding strategy   the core of it is still going to be over the air free television   he said   that s not going to change  <BRK>email kevin draper at kevin draper
