<BRK><BRK>by kevin draper and ken belson<BRK>the quarterback colin kaepernick ignited impassioned debate over race  activism and free expression after protesting police shooting of black men kneeling during  the star spangled banner  at national football league game in   <BRK>the president tweeted his anger at him and dozen of other player who also knelt in protest during the national anthem  some fan boycotted game over the player  action  and some boycotted the n f l  with the belief that mr  kaepernick  who failed to land a job the next season  wa being blacklisted for his leadership in the movement <BRK>now  two and a half year later  mr  kaepernick and a former teammate  eric reid  have reached a surprise legal settlement with the n f l   which they had accused of colluding to keep them out of the league <BRK>in a terse joint statement issued on friday afternoon  the league and the player  lawyer said that  the party have decided to resolve the pending grievance  and that  there will be no further comment  <BRK>a confidentiality agreement mean that  for all the debate and discussion the case generated  it ended with a silence that left hanging whether the league admitted there wa any collusion and whether mr  kaepernick would ever play another down <BRK>yet there most likely will be further discussion  a people debate whether mr  kaepernick wa right and what enduring lesson the owner and league might draw from the saga <BRK> the most important thing is he started a really important conversation that we ve been having for a couple of year  and the people who were willing to have that conversation have learned some thing   said michael maccambridge  the author of  america s game  the epic story of how pro football captured a nation  <BRK>he added   i suspect even if kaepernick knew how long it would take he might have done it differently  but he took a social stand and he wa willing to suffer the consequence of that  <BRK>mr  kaepernick     who played for the san francisco  er and took them to the super bowl after the   season  ha not played in the n f l  since the   season  when he began the kneeling campaign   at first he sat during the anthem  but a former player who is a military veteran suggested he kneel instead to make his point while respecting the american flag  <BRK>he filed a grievance under the league s collective bargaining agreement in october    month after failing to find a job  and his lawyer have been busy gathering evidence and testimony from numerous n f l  owner and league executive <BRK>the case seemed headed to a ruling this spring an arbitrator  until the abrupt statement on friday that left the sport world guessing on whether the league paid the player and how much <BRK>after protesting while playing for the  er  mr  reid     also went unsigned for a period before playing most of last season for the carolina panther  this week he signed a three year contract with the team <BRK>it is unclear whether kaepernick will continue trying to play professional football again <BRK>the settlement of their cae wa another unpredictable twist in a saga that began in august   when mr  kaepernick  an african american little known a an activist  began his protest during the anthem  he said the gesture wa meant to draw attention to racism and police brutality against people of color <BRK>several player across the league joined him in kneeling during the anthem  generating a national discussion over it and leaving the league flummoxed over how to respond  last year the n f l  instituted a policy that said player could remain in the locker room during the playing of the national anthem  but that if they were on the field they would have to stand <BRK>but that policy wa suspended after the n f l  player association filed a grievance  and it wa never enforced <BRK>the sideline protest movement seemed to lose momentum  and few player knelt during this past season  mr  kaepernick ha said little  reserving most of his comment for his social medium account  during the super bowl this month he posted on his instagram account picture of athlete and celebrity wearing jersey supporting his cause <BRK>on friday  he only retweeted a statement from his lawyer  mark geragos <BRK>mr  kaepernick emerged from the protest a both a polarizing figure and a cultural symbol  lat year  nike signed him to a lucrative endorsement deal even though he remained out of the league and largely silent  not typically what a brand want from an endorser <BRK>a year before  nike executive had decided to end their contract with mr  kaepernick  before being talked out of it  but with mr  kaepernick s growing stature in the civil right movement  the apparel company decided to make him a face of it  just do it  campaign  debuting a commercial narrated mr  kaepernick during the opening game of the n f l  season <BRK>legal expert have said collusion case are notoriously difficult to prove  which make it highly unusual for the league to settle a case like this  it is possible mr  kaepernick s lawyer had gathered enough persuasive evidence and testimony from owner  league official and football expert that mr  kaepernick stood a reasonable chance of persuading the arbitrator hearing the case to rule in his favor <BRK>frank hawkins  a former senior vice president of the n f l   said he thought the league wa probably more worried about embarrassing statement from owner getting out through a hearing than about losing the case <BRK> people say stupid thing  thing get taken out of context   he said   so i think there wa a reasonable potential for embarrassment and it is something that if they could settle it at a reasonable cost  they would probably just think it wa worth paying nuisance value  <BRK>had mr  kaepernick won his cae in a full hearing  he would have been eligible to receive the money he might have earned if he were signed a a free agent  in addition  he may have received double that amount in punitive damage  in his final year with the  er  mr  kaepernick earned more than    million <BRK>carl tobias  an expert on civil litigation who teach at the university of richmond school of law  said that party settle for all sort of reason  even when they believe they may prevail in court  but the n f l   he said  most likely wanted to move on from the issue rather than risk an adverse ruling that could  among other thing  taint negotiation over the league s collective bargaining agreement  which will expire in two season <BRK> i think the n f l  just wanted to get this behind them and not have this threat hanging over them   mr  tobias said   i think they d pay whatever they d get away with to stop the hemorrhaging and the negative light on the league  <BRK>according to the collective bargaining agreement between the league and the union  the burden is on the player to prove that owner actively conspired against him <BRK> that is often difficult to do because party typically don t leave a written record of their illegal maneuvering   said william gould  who wa chairman of the national labor relation board at the time of the major league baseball strike in   <BRK>mr  kaepernick  however  received a favorable ruling in august when the arbitrator overseeing the case  stephen b  burbank  dismissed the league s attempt to have the case thrown out  allowing lawyer for mr  kaepernick to question owner and league official in a format similar to a trial <BRK>it wa anticipated that mr  burbank would rule on the cae in the coming month  and a of lat week lawyer for mr  kaepernick were still preparing for final hearing in front of mr  burbank  according to a person with knowledge of the preparation <BRK>even though mr  kaepernick ha not played in more than two year  and his play had grown erratic in his last month on the field  his name had continued to surface every time an n f l  team signed a new quarterback  many of these quarterback had le experience or statistically did not seem to measure up to him <BRK>mr  kaepernick s name also continued to be invoked at major n f l  event  including the super bowl this month  when musician said they would not perform during halftime out of sympathy for his case <BRK>the associated press reported this week that a new league  the alliance of american football  spoke with mr  kaepernick but that he wanted at least    million to consider playing in it <BRK>mr  kaepernick s collusion case at time also exposed a bit of a rift between himself and the player  union  mr  kaepernick hired his own lawyer for the case instead of going through the union  and the union s statement on the resolution said it wa informed of the settlement the n f l  and wa unaware of the term <BRK>email kevin
