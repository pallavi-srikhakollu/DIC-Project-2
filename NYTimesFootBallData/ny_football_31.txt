important sport property  it s the single most important property in all of american television   mr  costa said   and it isn t even close  <BRK>an nbc sport spokesman confirmed that mr  costa had been told that he had  crossed the line  but said it wa not because he had discused the topic of brain injury and football  instead  the spokesman said  it wa because mr  costa had agreed after the

agreeable  <BRK>the parting wa the culmination of mr  costa s wavering commitment over many year to covering the n f l  he stepped away from nbc s coverage in the  s  later saying the decision wa because he  had ambivalent feeling about football   yet he wa a host of hbo s  inside the n f l   in the  s and then rejoined nbc s coverage of the sport in the     seaon  when the network started a

enlightened legislation and control  on gun a day after a kansa city chief player shot and killed his girlfriend and then himself <BRK>the network never received criticism or complaint from the n f l  about mr  costa s coverage or commentary  including his remark at the   symposium  mr  hughes said <BRK>by the time mr  costa appeared at that event  he had already taken a back seat in nbc s coverage  he hosted the first  football night in america  of the     football season but then handed off the remaining show to mike tirico  who had moved over from espn to become nbc s face of major sport event  when nbc eventually announced that mr  costa would not participate in the super bowl broadcast  he said that it would not have been fair to those who had been there the entire season <BRK> it
