 <BRK>  <BRK> a football fan reflects on a year without tom brady  <BRK> by alex kingsbury <BRK> mr  kingsbury is a member of the editorial board  <BRK> i m pleased that the new england patriot made it to the a f c  championship game again this year  on sunday  they ll play the kansa city chief at     p m   and the winner will advance to the super bowl  <BRK> i ve been a patriot fan my entire life  long before they were good enough to loathe  but i won t be watching football this weekend  i haven t watched a single pas or tackle all season  <BRK> i don t remember much about last year s a f c  championship game between the patriot and the jacksonville jaguar  but i ll never forget the sound  <BRK> the pat were down     with     left in the second quarter when the tight end rob gronkowski tried to catch a long  lofted pas from the quarterback  tom brady   <BRK> he almost had it   <BRK> but the jag  safety  barry church  hit mr  gronkowski just a he wa pulling it down  <BRK> their hard plastic helmet hit each other with such force that   even through the tinny speaker on my television   it sounded like a rifle shot  you can see and hear the collision here  <BRK> it still echo in my ear   <BRK> a the sound of the hit faded into a commercial break  i realized with absolute certainty that i couldn t watch football anymore  there aren t enough yard to gain or super bowl ring to win that are worth the cost  <BRK> to use a euphemism from the era before we knew about brain damage  mr  gronkowski  got his bell rung   shaken the impact  he struggled to his foot  wobbled and wa helped off the field with a concussion  mr  church wa fined      the n f l  for an illegal hit  <BRK>  i hope he s all right   mr  church said after the game   if you go low for the knee  you are considered a dirty player  and if you go high  they throw the flag at you  it s a bang bang play  and i wa just trying to play football   <BRK>  it s football   mr  gronkowski later told the press   it is what it is   <BRK> and that s the problem  <BRK> the first research into the link between football and traumatic brain injury wa published in    since then  the science ha become impossible to ignore   <BRK> in    the journal of the american medical association published the result of the autopsy of the brain of   deceased former n f l  player  whose relative gave their body up for study  the group wa not a random sample  yet   showed sign of chronic traumatic encephalopathy  or c t e   a degenerative brain disease linked to concussion  research published in november estimated that a minimum of   percent of all professional football player would develop c t e  at some point in their life   <BRK> professional athlete are well compensated for their dangerous job  but the pipeline is a problem  it can take more than a decade of hard hit to make it to a college team or the pro  <BRK> research published in the journal of pediatrics last month found that concussion rate for youth football player were higher than previously reported  in all  some   percent of all youth football player receive concussion each year  a figure that may sound low  but compound with each additional year of play  in    a study found that playing football before age   doubled the risk of problem with behavioral regulation  apathy and executive functioning  it tripled the risk of elevated depression  <BRK> it s little wonder that lawmaker last year in new york  illinois  california  maryland and new jersey introduced bill to ban or restrict youth tackle football  <BRK> all this isn t the snowflaking of the next generation of american men  it s physic  technology   in the form of  say  better helmet   will not save the game  researcher note that helmet don t prevent all concussion and might be making the problem worse  giving player a false sense of invincibility  <BRK> the danger of the game are clear to the insurance company that cover youth and professional league  an investigation published espn s  outside the line  this week found that the insurance market for youth football is  fundamentally altering the economics of the sport  squeezing and even killing off program faced with higher cost and a scarcity of available coverage   <BRK>  people say football will never go away  but if we can t get insurance  it will   jon butler  the executive director of the youth football program pop warner  is reported to have said   <BRK> the report said that the n f l  is also having problem finding company willing to insure against head injury  <BRK> with no safe way to play   short of flag football   it s little wonder that participation in youth football is on the decline  some high school have dropped the sport altogether  while state legislature are passing and updating concussion law to ensure school that do field team take the issue seriously  every state now ha a concussion law on the book  <BRK> nor is it surprising that some younger n f l  player are calling it quits  mr  gronkowski  now    reportedly considered retirement after last season  report say he s considering doing so after this one  too  <BRK> there are still newton denier  who contest his law of physic  which explain how the human brain slam into the interior wall of the skull during a concussion  <BRK>  your body get used to the hit   the patriot  tom brady told a sport radio show last month   the brain understands the position that you are putting your body into  and my brain is wired for contact  i would say in some way it ha become callous to some of the hit   <BRK> mr  brady s former teammate  ted johnson  spent   year in the n f l  and told the time in    at age    that he wa suffering from symptom characteristic of early alzheimer s diseae a a result of concussion   there s something wrong with my brain   he said  <BRK> mr  johnson called mr  brady s recent remark about concussion  irresponsible    <BRK>  i ll be honest  and i love tom  it made me throw up in my mouth a little bit   he said  <BRK> despite all these concern  there s little indication that football will be dethroned a america s favorite sport  television rating  which have taken some hard hit of their own over the pat few year  have rebounded this seaon  and the super bowl might be the most communal experience the country ha in    <BRK> this sunday  i won t begrudge my father  who ll watch the game delayed on dvr  so he doesn t have to endure commercial to get to the   minute of action  nor my cousin  who ll bet money on the game  seeing the occasional patriot hat or jersey on the street is a nice reminder of the tribe i ve parted way with   <BRK> because a long a i can hear the sound of gronk getting his bell rung  i ll find something else to watch   <BRK> follow the new york time opinion
