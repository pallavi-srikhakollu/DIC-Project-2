<BRK><BRK>by ken belson and benedict carey<BRK>experimental brain scan of more than two dozen former n f l  player found that the men had abnormal level of the protein linked to chronic traumatic encephalopathy  the degenerative brain disease associated with repeated hit to the head <BRK>using positron emission tomography  or pet  scan  the researcher found  elevated amount of abnormal tau protein  in the part of the brain asociated with the diseae  known a c t e   compared to men of similar age who had not played football <BRK>the author of the study and outside expert stressed that such tau imaging is far from a diagnostic test for c t e   which is likely year away and could include other marker  from blood and spinal fluid <BRK>the result of the study  published in the new england journal of medicine on wednesday  are considered preliminary  but constitute a first step toward developing a clinical test to determine the presence of c t e  in living player  a well a early sign and potential risk <BRK>thus far  pathologist have been able to confirm the diagnosis only posthumously  identifying the tau signature in donated brain <BRK>previous study had reported elevated level of the tau signature in single case  the new study is the first to compare the brain of a group of former player to a control group  using an imaging approach that specifically pick up tau and not other protein in the brain <BRK> what make this exciting is that it s a great first step for imaging c t e  in the living  not just looking at single instance  but comparing average and looking for pattern comparing group   said kevin bieniek  director of the biggs institute brain bank core at the university of texas health science center in san antonio <BRK>dr  bieniek wa not involved in the study <BRK>over the past decade  the competition for research dollar to investigate c t e  ha become fierce and political  with charge of exaggerated claim and interference the n f l   which ha produced scientific report to rebut any link between the disease and repeated head trauma <BRK>the group that develops the first useful clinical test stand to attract a surge of funding  not to mention potential commercial partnership  at least one group  in california  ha already formed a company to promote it own test <BRK>the new study wa led dr  robert stern of boston university  which thus far ha the largest collection of donated brain from former pro football player  he led a coalition of investigator at multiple center who took brain image from   former pro player  aged   to    who had a variety of memory  mood and mental problem associated with c t e <BRK>those image showed marked elevation of tau protein in the area of the brain that display the tau signature when diagnosed post mortem  the player  tau signal in those area wa higher  on average  than the tau signal from a control group of men who had not played <BRK> we found  a well  that the amount of abnormal tau detected in these pet scan wa asociated with the number of year playing football   dr  stern said <BRK>his collaborator included brain scientist from the mayo clinic arizona  brigham and woman s hospital and avid radiopharmaceutical  avid make a molecule  called a ligand  that bind to protein  in this case in the brain  avid s ligand is the most studied of the so called tau detector  and the company helped finance the study <BRK>expert said the finding were encouraging  because any reliable marker for abnormal tau accumulation would allow doctor not only to identify people with c t e   but also to monitor progress from potential drug treatment <BRK>but  these expert said  much more work is required to develop a reliable test for a disorder that is still not well understood  a in test for people suffering from alzheimer s and other diseaes that affect the brain  researcher have spent year trying to precisely refine the ligand that are ingested patient before they receive pet scan and other imaging test <BRK>there are also many open question about the tau protein that is a signature of c t e  researcher are trying to determine whether the protein  which occurs naturally in the brain  accumulates faster in people who have received repeated head trauma  and how those accumulating level are related to behavior associated with c t e   which include not only memory deficit but also impulse control issue and symptom of depression <BRK>the new study found no correlation between the strength of the abnormal tau signature and the severity of cognitive and mood problem in the former player  though the sample wa small <BRK>the search for a test for c t e  in living patient ha received intense scrutiny since the disease wa first discovered in deceased professional football player   year ago <BRK>the universe of professional player is relatively small   only about     active player and     retiree   and the boston group s work ha been based on a sample of some of the worst case  many  perhaps most  pro football player do not develop disabling cognitive problem  and there are likely many other brain trauma that could potentially result in the c t e  tau signature <BRK>yet football is far the country s most popular sport  with more than a million high school student playing the tackle version of the game  the detection of c t e  in former pro player turned what wa viewed a an occupational hazard into a public health debate  for year now  parent  coach  school administrator  doctor and others have engaged in a dispute over whether child should be allowed to play collision sport <BRK>part of that dispute is trying to prove  or disprove  whether there is a direct link between exposure to repeated hit to the head absorbed in game like tackle football and the development of cognitive and neurological problem later in life <BRK>here  the science is emerging  study dr  stern and other researcher  including in the paper just released  suggest that there is a dose response   the more hit to the head  the more likely you are to develop problem later <BRK>but researcher have questioned study that have shown a high percentage of deceased former football player found with c t e  they claimed that the research subject were self selected because the family of player who suspected they had brain disease were more likely to donate their brain to science <BRK>some researcher are looking at broader population of people who have had traumatic brain injury  not just football player  to determine whether participation in collision sport  a opposed to genetics or other factor  is linked to the development of c t e <BRK> there s a lot of lower level head trauma out there that no one know the consequence of   said dr  john trojanowski  a research at the perelman school of medicine at the university of pennsylvania  who plan to submit a research paper in the coming month on people who have suffered traumatic brain injury   we are looking at people with traumatic brain injury  football player  rugby player  some people who fell off bike  <BRK>even when tau is found in pet scan  many other question remain <BRK> identifying the tau is just a first step   said dr  alexander power  associate professor of neurosurgery  pediatrics and orthopedics at wake forest school of medicine   is tau increasing in the brain  and what is the rate  doe it steadily increase  or rapidly  like cancer  and what are the factor that led to it  <BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK>
