 <BRK>  <BRK> the effect of head trauma have gotten much of the attention  but huge weight gain have also damaged n f l  retiree   <BRK> by ken belson <BRK> an insidious scourge that ha nothing to do with head trauma is ravaging retired n f l  player  <BRK> in the past few decade  the n f l  s emphais on the passing game and quarterback protection ha led team to stock their offensive and defensive line with ever larger men  many of them weighing well over   pound  but their great girth  which coach encouraged and which helped turn some player into multimillion dollar commodity  leaf many of them prone to obesity problem  <BRK> in retirement  these huge men are often unable to lose the weight they needed to do their job  without the structure of a team and the guidance of coach for the first time in decade  many of them lose the motivation to stay in shape  or cannot even try  a damage to their foot  knee  back and shoulder limit their ability to exercise   <BRK> this is a big reason that former linemen  compared with other football player and the general population  have higher rate of hypertension  obesity and sleep apnea  which can lead to chronic fatigue  poor diet and even death  blocking for a    million a year quarterback  it turn out  can put linemen in the high risk category for many of the ailment health expert readily encourage people to avoid   <BRK>  linemen are bigger  and in today s world  rightly or wrongly  they are told to bulk up   said henry buchwald  a specialist in bariatric surgery at the university of minnesota who work with the living heart foundation  a nonprofit organization that provides free medical test to former n f l  player   their eating habit are hard to shed when they stop playing  and when they get obese  they get exposed to diabetes  hypertension and cardiac problem   <BRK> many linemen say they were encouraged their high school and college coach to gain weight to win scholarship and to be drafted the n f l   where a lot of player were required to become even bigger  in some case  player were converted from tight end to down linemen  and needed extra weight to play the new position  coach often leave it up to the player to decide how to gain weight   <BRK> joe thoma  an all pro lineman with the cleveland brown  said that a a freshman in college he ate every few hour to gain the   pound he needed to get to   pound  he gobbled burger  frozen pizza and large bowl of ice cream   it wa see food  eat food   thoma said  <BRK> the living heart foundation ha examined several thousand former player since it wa formed in   with financial backing from the n f l  player  union  about two third of those player   not just linemen   had a body mas index above    which is considered moderately obese  a third of those screened were at   or above  or significantly obese  the index  which is viewed a a general indication of weight relative to size  doe not take into account muscle mas   <BRK> linemen have been getting heavier  faster  from   to    they have gained an average of three quarter of a pound to two pound a year  about twice the average gain for all n f l  player  according to a study published in the journal of strength and conditioning research  <BRK> another study showed that the average weight of offensive linemen ballooned   percent  from   pound in the  s to   pound in the  s  a the pasing game evolved   <BRK> the consequence can be dire  a study published in the american journal of medicine found that for every   pound football player gained from high school to college  or from college to the professional level  the risk of heart disease rose   percent compared with player whose weight changed little during the same period  <BRK> plenty of linemen do lose weight  the former linemen matt birk and nick hardwick shed dozen of pound after retiring and publicized their achievement  thomas  who retired last year after   season with the brown  gained roughly   pound after entering the n f l  he ha since lost about   pound eating le and eating healthier  <BRK>  i reversed everything i wa doing   said thomas  who weighed about   pound in the n f l   no more freezer pizza before bed  i dialed back the carbs  added whole grain  couscous  quinoa   <BRK> the n f l  and the player  union  recognizing more must be done  offer retired player medical exam  health club membership and other service  dozen of retired player  for instance  get free health screening at the super bowl  <BRK> still  many player are unreachable  said archie robert  a former n f l  quarterback and retired heart surgeon who started the living heart foundation   if you don t guide player through it  they won t show up  if we can t get them to follow through  they won t get the health care they deserve   <BRK> many former linemen said they woke to the danger of being obese when the hall of famer reggie white died in   of cardiac arrhythmia  white also had sleep apnea  <BRK> linemen are prone to the affliction  in which a person s breathing repeatedly stop and start because the muscle in their neck press against the breathing pasage a they sleep  this cut off the flow of oxygen and wake the player  often for a second or two  the continual sleep interruption can make it difficult for those with sleep apnea to feel fully rested  <BRK> former linemen have big neck  and a they age their throat tissue becomes flabby  so their tongue can block their airway  said anthony scianni  a dentist who run the center for dental sleep medicine  which work with former n f l  player  <BRK> the lack of oxygen  scianni said  stimulates the body to produce more sugar  which can cause type   diabetes and lead to overeating and other problem  <BRK> derek kennard  a guard for   season with the cardinal  the saint and the cowboy  ha battled to reverse this cycle  he snored so loudly   a common symptom of sleep apnea   that his roommate in his last season asked for a different room  after kennard retired in    the year of sleep deprivation led to other problem  he ate poorly and gained   pound  he took vicodin to deal with the pain of his football injury  the pain  lack of sleep and extra weight made it difficult to exercise  his cholesterol level and blood pressure jumped  he would fall asleep behind the wheel while stopped at traffic light  <BRK>  you re not sleeping well  so your body is not healing itself   said kennard  whose son devon is a linebacker for the lion   <BRK> after his brother died in    kennard  who is   foot   and whose weight peaked at   pound  sought help  he wa tested for sleep apnea and wa told he woke   time per hour  one episode of not breathing lated   minute   second  because he flip in bed a he sleep  kennard had trouble wearing the mak of a cpap machine  which delivers continuous positive airway pressure and is the standard treatment for sleep apnea  he switched to a mouthpiece that kept his airway open  he now wake just twice an hour  and sleep about seven hour a night  his weight fell to about   pound  and he stopped taking painkiller  <BRK>  a hundred pound came off quickly because i had energy to do exercise   he said at a conference for retired player in phoenix  where he life   <BRK> kennard urge other former player to be checked for sleep apnea  and try to convince them that wearing a mask doe not make them weak  <BRK>  i had so much death in my life  i could see it in front of me   he said  <BRK> vaughn parker  a tackle who played   year  mostly with the charger  struggled with overeating  and after a dozen surgery on his shoulder  ankle and triceps  he had a hard time exercising to shed weight   <BRK> he also got busy  parker invested in real estate in san diego until the market collapsed in    he had two child  split with his wife and studied for an m b a   which he finished in may    the stress led him to eat more  and before he knew it  he had added   pound to his   foot   frame and weighed more than   pound   <BRK>  everyone ha their cross to bear   said parker     who also ha high blood pressure   for some people  it s gambling or alcohol  for me  it s food   <BRK> in    parker received a phone call from aaron taylor  a former teammate  who encouraged him to work out with other retired n f l  player who received free gym membership from the trust  a group started the n f l  and the

ability and injury  afterward  the handful of former player discussed their progress and drank nutritional shake  they learned about portion control and shopping for healthy food  parker knew he had lost his best chance to become fit  which is right after retirement  but he tried to catch up  <BRK>  his workout were exhausting  but he stuck with the program  in part driven the camaraderie of the other ex player  and shed nearly   pound the first year   there wasn t a day i didn t sit at the edge of my bed and say i m not going today   parker said   <BRK> keeping the weight off ha been a

 chicken wing and fried food  <BRK> but the prospect of cascading health problem motivates parker to keep exercising  he recently re enrolled in a six week training program at exos  <BRK>  how many   pound offensive linemen are walking around in their  s   he said  <BRK> linemen are not the only player who need to keep the pound on to play their position  tight end and linebacker often do a well
