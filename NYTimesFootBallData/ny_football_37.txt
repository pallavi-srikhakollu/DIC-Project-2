broadcast booth  not the field  he wa hired cbs in june to be a rule analyst for it n f l  and college basketball telecast <BRK>at    steratore is young enough   and fit enough   to be a referee for several more year  but after reaching the top of that profession  he is relishing doing something new  and  in some way even more high profile than serving a chief cop on the biggest stage in american sport  he now explains the intricacy of the rule book to ten of million of sport fan watching on television <BRK> the excitement of the unknown  becoming a neophyte again  at a very high level  wa extremely challenging to me   steratore said <BRK>steratore ha made some of the most scrutinized   and denigrated   n f l  call of the last decade  he overturned a potential winning touchdown catch detroit s calvin johnson and a dez bryant catch for dallas in the playoff four year ago  then last february  he upheld disputed touchdown grab made philadelphia s corey clement and zach ertz <BRK> calvin johnson didn t catch it  dez bryant didn t catch it  corey clement and zach ertz did catch it  o k   it s time to quit  that s it  i m out of here   steratore said while laughing during an interview day ahead of super bowl liii <BRK> read about sticky glove and amazing catch  <BRK>when steratore started wearing zebra stripe  his current job did not exist  in    fox became the first network to hire an n f l  rule analyst  mike pereira  formerly the league s director of officiating  cbs  nbc and espn have followed suit  steratore is teamed with jim nantz  a veteran broadcaster  and tony romo  a wunderkind play predictor  but if the super bowl is anything like the conference championship game  steratore will be the member of the broadcast team sitting under the brightest spotlight <BRK>in the n f c  title game  shown on fox  the official failed to call an obvious penalty on los angeles ram cornerback nickell robey coleman late in the fourth quarter after he hit new orleans saint receiver tommylee lewis before the ball arrived  the saint went on to kick a field goal  but the ram tied the game and eventually won it in overtime <BRK>the noncall ha dominated football chatter for the pat two week  a a result  n f l  rule and their interpretation are top of mind <BRK>steratore  calling the a f c  championship  had his own mess  err  mess  to deal with  after barely speaking for the first three quarter  steratore wa asked to comment on six fourth quarter play  including one that produced a questionable roughing the passer penalty against kansa city chief defensive tackle chris jones <BRK>he defended clete blakeman  the referee who made the call  and then stated plainly that blakeman got it wrong   it s a swing and a miss  and it s a missed call for roughing the passer there   steratore said on the telecast <BRK> read what happens when player and official chat on the field  <BRK>steratore  one of seven brother and sister  come from a family of referee  his older brother  tony  is an n f l  official  and his younger brother  michael  referee lower division college basketball  his father  also named gene  wa a college football and basketball official  and a cousin  frank  just officiated the college football national championship game <BRK>he is almost a close with his refereeing comrade  the head of the crew that botched the robey coleman noncall  bill vinovich  wa  with steratore  one of the two active n f l  referee officiating division i college baketball game <BRK> vinny and i have a special relationship   steratore said <BRK>he ha said repeatedly this week that vinovich s crew got the call wrong  but also defended vinovich  who told a pool reporter after the game that he had not seen the play <BRK>steratore explained that vinovich s specific responsibility on the play wa to watch the offensive line and the quarterback  not a pas   yard down the field <BRK> if you turn your head when that ball leaf and that quarterback get hit at his knee or below and he s laying there out  and there is no flag  it is a much more egregious mistake than this one   steratore said <BRK>gerald austin  a former referee and espn rule analyst for six season  said part of the analyst job were harder than being a referee <BRK>there are seven official on the field  each covering a specific area  but a rule analyst must cover it all  while analyst are watching the ball  there could be a development across the field they are asked to comment on a few second later  with limited time to watch a replay <BRK> your decision ha to be quicker and more on target in a shorter period of time   austin said <BRK>steratore said his job also involved educating viewer about the process of ruling on difficult call  he quickly explains the situation and generally what the official are considering  and then  after a few replay  he go over the specific thing they are looking at to make a call <BRK>only after he ha seen every relevant angle doe he say what the call should be <BRK> the greatest official in the world  they re in the n f l    steratore said   it is fun to hate them  and it s part of our game and we re cool with that  we still need to have someone explaining to the world that these people are that good at what they do  even with their mistake  <BRK>steratore grew up in uniontown  pa   and now life in washington  pa   both about an hour outside of pittsburgh  he officiated   steelers game in his career  including two against their division rival  the baltimore raven  brian billick  the former raven coach  would tell steratore he wanted him to referee every one of those game <BRK> his reverse psychology wa that if it wa a     play  i might be more inclined to go his way for fear of what the public may think   steratore said <BRK>billick said his request wa mostly tongue in cheek  though he thought it wa  worth bringing up just to get him to think about it   maybe he ll pause  <BRK>the referee for the super bowl will be john parry  who wa promoted to his job in   after vinovich temporarily retired because of health problem  steratore know parry well  of course  his brother tony officiated a previous super bowl alongside parry  and parry s late father  david  wa the supervisor of official for the big ten <BRK>steratore said he expected parry to do a great job  but if he doesn t  or when he inevitably ha to deal with an incredibly tight play  steratore will be ready <BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK>
