<BRK><BRK>a blown call and a game ending   yard field goal lifted los angeles past new orleans and into the super bowl  <BRK>by ben shpigel  scott cacciola and zach schonbrun<BRK>the triumphant locker room at the super dome started out so crowded sunday night that personal space seemed like an extravagance  but a the room emptied  and the jubilant los angeles ram continued a celebration that would rival any bacchanalia in this city s french quarter  the player who helped preserve their seaon blatantly breaking the rule stood in the middle of it all  still in full uniform  delighted to answer question after question about his fateful  and fortunate  moment <BRK>amid the mayhem after a     overtime victory that propelled the ram past the saint and into the super bowl  that player  cornerback nickell robey coleman  got his first look at the replay of his helmet to helmet  fourth quarter thump on new orleans receiver tommylee lewis  peering at a reporter s cell phone  he could see himself slide into view and clobber lewis before the pas arrived <BRK>for robey coleman  it wa just visual confirmation for what he already knew   he had been guilty of pas interference on lewis and somehow had gotten away with it <BRK> i felt more than lucky   robey coleman said  when asked how he felt when no penalty wa called  allowing the ram to stay within   point when the saint were forced to kick a field goal rather than go for a touchdown   i felt blessed  <BRK>the repercussion of that play will be felt everywhere from the league office  which acknowledged to new orleans coach sean payton afterward that the officiating crew botched the call  to this mystical city  which will now mourn a second consecutive infuriating exit from the postseaon for their beloved saint  just   week ago  the saint lost in the divisional round of the playoff when minnesota scored on a lat second    yard touchdown   nearly the same distance a greg zuerlein s   yard field goal that doomed them on sunday <BRK>but in the giddy aftermath of sunday s game  the missed call maybe resonated even deeper for a los angeles franchise that went     two seaon ago after relocating to southern california from st  louis and entrusted a   year old coaching prodigy  sean mcvay  to return the ram to prominence  and now  on the   year anniversary of their only super bowl appearance a a los angeles franchise  the ram have advanced there for the second time <BRK> we walked into the interview saying   how on earth could we hire a   year old  we walked out of the interview saying   how could we not hire sean mcvay   the ram  chief operating officer  kevin demoff  said in recalling the decision to hire mcvay <BRK> he s a great football coach    demoff added   he s not a quarterback whisperer  he s not an offensive genius  today he found a great way for our team to play complementary football  we kicked two field goal to go to the super bowl  <BRK>in one night  the ram vindicated two off season  worth of bold personnel move intended to turn a middling team from st  louis into a champion in los angeles  having pierced the aura of the superdome  where payton and quarterback drew brees had won their previous six playoff game  the ram will now face new england on feb    in atlanta <BRK>it is not a surprise that the patriot   who also advanced with an overtime victory      at top seeded kansa city   will be there  they always are  but the ram have gotten this far because  at bottom  every move they made after losing to atlanta in the playoff last year  all the off season splurge and in season roster churn  positioned them to thrive amid the jackhammer in your ear din that they confronted on sunday in the superdome <BRK> we didn t feel pressure   said cornerback aqib talib  one of several new player on the ram  revamped defense   we applied it  <BRK>this n f c  title game matchup registered somewhere between sunrise and sunset on the inevitability scale  since september  new orleans and los angeles had jockeyed for the conference s top seed  with one coaching mastermind named sean striving to duplicate the success of another  no other matchup embodied the season s offensive boom better than having the conference s most prolific team   who combined for   point in the saint  week   home victory over the ram   vying to outscore each other for a second time <BRK>on sunday  a full quarter elapsed before the ram looked comfortable   or  at least  they no longer looked sleeping above an alligator pit uncomfortable   and then gradually  they chiseled away at the saint  lead  they trailed   after the first quarter but just   at halftime and ultimately tied the score  at      on zuerlein s   yarder with     left in the game <BRK>the other day in the saint  cafeteria  brees  newly    glanced up and saw himself on television  the channel wa showing the n f c  championship game from    the last time new orleans played in the super bowl  his teammate ribbed him about all the hair he had nine year ago  all the hair he seems to have lost <BRK>seizing the chance sunday to lead them to another  brees drove the saint to the ram     on third and    lewis scooted out of the backfield and ran a wheel route  brees saw him and released a pas down the near sideline   the saint  sideline   toward lewis  who wa now inside the   yard line  the ball never reached him  robey coleman made certain of that <BRK>the officiating crew  which could have called any number of penalty on the play   pas interference and unnecessary roughness among them   opted to call none  the referee  bill vinovich  told a pool reporter that he  personally  had not seen what occurred <BRK>the saint protested  payton ranted and screamed  the public address announcer admonished fan not to throw debris onto the field  instead of scoring a touchdown or draining time off the clock  the saint settled for wil lutz s   yard field goal that put them ahead     <BRK> it wa simple  they blew the call   payton said <BRK>for the ram and for jared goff  the quarterback who blossomed under mcvay s tutelage and became one of the best in the league    second remained to tie or even win the game  goff  who overcame a first quarter interception to complete   of   pass for   yard and a touchdown  proceeded to direct the ram into field goal range  and zuerlein equalized from   yard with just   second left in the fourth quarter <BRK>after winning the overtime coin toss  knowing that a touchdown would win the game but a field goal would return the ball to the ram  new orleans faced a  nd and   at it    charging on a stunt  ram linebacker dante fowler  acquired from jacksonville the trade deadline  reached brees and hit him in the wrist a he threw  causing his pas to float  safety john johnson  defending michael thoma  watched the ball reach it apex from his back  he barely moved a he intercepted it <BRK> i saw it the whole way   johnson said   i m glad i got my contact in  i probably would have dropped it if i didn t  <BRK>goff ran back onto the field  the ram with the ball at their own    five play from deliverance  and general manager le snead said it all felt akin to climbing the  th green at augusta national golf club <BRK> the hole get smaller   snead said <BRK>demoff harked back to a conversation he had with goff after that miserable   season  when he lost all seven of his start  goff told him that he knew how to turn around the franchise since  he said  he had done it in college  at berkeley   i know we re not that far   goff told him at the time  and indeed the ram weren t <BRK>they won a second consecutive n f c  west title this seaon  they beat dalla lat week  and when zuerlein went on to kick his   yarder  they had conquered new orleans a well  the fact that the referee helped the ram  too  won t make them any le proud <BRK> the referee made the call  we respect it   robey coleman said   now i m going to the super bowl  nobody can change that  <BRK>  ben shpigel<BRK> the new england patriot beat the kansa city chief       in the a f c  championship game sunday  and will face the winner of this game in the super bowl  see how they did it here  <BRK>here s how the ram beat the saint <BRK>he s known a greg the leg for a reaon <BRK>a   yard kick zuerlein ha sent the los angeles ram to the super bowl for the first time since    what a turnaround goff and the ram  who trailed   in an incredibly loud and hostile stadium  and largely orchestrated that comeback without their pro bowl running back  todd gurley <BRK>  zach schonbrun<BRK>and the most accurate quarterback in n f l  history is picked off in overtime <BRK>brees s arm wa hit a he threw  leaving a ball that hung in the air  ram defender john johnson came down with the interception a he wa falling down on his back in saint  territory  los angeles can now win it with a field goal <BRK>  zach schonbrun<BRK>hello  overtime  the ram got down to the   yard line  but the saint defense held firm  and a   yard field goal greg zuerlein tied the game with   second left  the saint elected to kneel it to send it to the extra period <BRK>but that no call on the lewis play on the last drive continues to look worse and worse  saint coach sean payton is still pleading his case to the referee and the fan are still booing  hard to believe <BRK>  zach schonbrun<BRK>saint settle for a field goal to take a     lead and give the ram back the ball with   minute   second left and one timeout  but the saint and the fan were upset that ram cornerback robey coleman hit tommylee lewis early on a pas out in the flat  both player went up for the ball  but coleman connected with lewis before the ball touched him  fan are booing and  from replay  it certainly looked like the flag should have been thrown there  that could have ended the game because the saint could have run down the clock before kicking a field goal  once again  an n f l  playoff game could be decided the referee <BRK>  zach schonbrun<BRK>you just knew the saint were going to try to take a shot downfield at some point  they ve been thriving on their usual mix of underneath pass and creative screen  but  with time ticking down to the two minute warning  brees finally uncorked a bomb to ted ginn jr   who out leaped the safety lamarcus joyner for the ball   yard downfield  the saint are now in the red zone with three timeouts and le than two minute left <BRK>  zach schonbrun<BRK>after trailing      the ram have climbed back to tie it with just about five minute remaining  after starting the drive on their own   yard line  goff drove his team all the way down the field  and a rush c j  anderson wa stopped on the   yard line  ram coach sean mcvay like to be aggressive  but going for it on fourth down and passing up the chance to tie wa a bit too risky even for him  so after a field goal  we are all even <BRK>  zach schonbrun<BRK>that wa a huge series for the saint defense  which forced the ram to punt from their own   yard line   and just when the ram looked to be seizing momentum  again   add in a personal foul against the ram on the punt  and the saint will take over at the ram    <BRK>  scott cacciola<BRK>ram continue to gah the saint for big yardage play  just a they did against the dalla cowboy lat week  brandin cook now ha   yard receiving after a   yard catch and run  an end around josh reynolds then went for   yard all the way to the   yard line  setting up a touchdown pas to tyler higbee to make it      after the score  higbee immediately put his finger to his lip  shhhhhhhh   don t think the saint fan will listen  though  <BRK>  zach schonbrun<BRK>so much for the ram  momentum  after they went three and out on their opening series of the second half  the saint took over and marched down the field  their   play    yard drive culminated in a   yard touchdown pas from brees to taysom hill  the team s third string quarterback      but really  that drive wa all about alvin kamara  the saint  do everything tailback  kamara caught four pases for   yard and ran once for   yard  sparking new orleans   and the crowd is once again in a tizzy <BRK>  scott cacciola<BRK>don t count the ram out yet  they turned up the defensive pressure on brees  sacking him on consecutive play  then two big throw jared goff to brandin cook   including a beautiful   yard completion to the   yard line   have put the ram right back in it  a touchdown run gurley  remember him   make it a     game at halftime <BRK>  zach schonbrun<BRK>that series wa the best possible sequence of event for the ram  not only did gurley get involved with the touchdown run   welcome back  todd   but the ram also absolutely silenced the crowd before halftime  and don t forget  the ram will get the ball to start the second half <BRK>  scott cacciola<BRK>something to watch  the ram have gone away from todd gurley  their all pro running back  since that early pas that wound up being an interception slipped through his hand  c j  anderson  signed late in the regular season when gurley wa sidelined with a knee injury  ha been getting the bulk of the carry in his place  anderson and gurley were both terrific last weekend in the ram  divisional round victory over the dallas cowboy <BRK>  scott cacciola<BRK>special team are already a factor in this game  which feature two of the best and most creative unit in the league <BRK>on the ram  last drive  coach sean mcvay made the gutsy call to fake the punt and throw a pas on  th and    which finally gave the ram some offensive momentum   the result wa a field goal to get on the board       <BRK>on the other side  the saint  special team were the most efficient in the n f l  this season  led the well respected mike westhoff  and they love to employ taysom hill in innovative way <BRK>  zach schonbrun<BRK>if there s one word to sum this game up so far  it might be noise  it is so loud inside this building  and just to give saint fan a friendly nudge  the game operation department here keep flashing a giant  make noise  sign on the jumbotron  with flame licking all the letter  noise  of course  is part of the strategy  veteran in the press box who have been to many sport event here at the superdome are saying this is the loudest they ve heard it   and the noise is clearly affecting the ram  jared goff had the experience of playing against the saint here earlier this season  but suffice it to say the atmosphere wa slightly more muted back in november than it is today <BRK>  scott cacciola<BRK>fifteen  that s the total yardage for the ram in the first quarter  their lowest total for a quarter this season  that doe not include a single first down  and they re facing another third down when the second quarter begin  more alarming  the crowd noise at the superdome caused the ram to commit a false start after they had just called a timeout   because of the crowd noise <BRK>  zach schonbrun<BRK>it s starting to look like a nightmarish start for the ram in new orleans <BRK>in the red zone for a third time already in the first quarter  the saint brought their do everything backup quarterback taysom hill in on third down but could not convert the run pas option play  no matter  new orleans brought brees back onto the field on  th and   from the   yard line  and he got the ram to jump offside <BRK>on the next play  two ram defender ran into each other  and brees found garrett griffin wide open in the end zone      new orleans <BRK>los angeles look completely out of sort on defense  but the saint have that effect on a lot of team <BRK>  zach schonbrun<BRK>it s probably worth noting the colossal difference in time of possession here so far  while the ram have had the ball for a grand total of   minute   second  the saint have had it for      the ram  defense is already working hard  and probably did well to limit the saint to two field goal on their first two series  goff and his offense could do the defense a huge favor keeping the ball here for more than another three and out <BRK>  scott cacciola<BRK>on the n f l  s radio broadcast  they are reporting that ram quarterback jared goff wa having problem with the audio inside his helmet  meaning he couldn t hear coach sean mcvay  the ram are hoping that the issue is resolved <BRK>  scott cacciola<BRK>oh boy  new orleans force a turnover a a dropped pas todd gurley go right into the arm of saint linebacker demario davis on the ram  own   yard line  it wa l a  s first turnover in three game  and it give new orleans a chance to take a commanding early start <BRK>  zach schonbrun<BRK>it did not take long for drew brees to make a little history  with his third completion of the saint  opening drive  he pased the great dan marino for sixth on the all time postseaon completion list with    incidentally  the ram made an unusual decision to defer after winning the coin toss  giving the saint the ball to start   a small gamble when brees is the opposing quarterback and this crowd is fired up   the kid might refer to the superdome a  lit    all thing considered the ram were fortunate to get off the field after giving up just a field goal <BRK>  scott cacciola<BRK>the last time the los angeles ram and new orleans saint met  they combined for   point and   yard of offense  and the saint ended the ram  dream of going undefeated the entire season <BRK>here is what to know now <BRK>the winner get to go to the super bowl  to face the winner of the af c  championship game  that
