<BRK><BRK>by kevin draper and ken belson<BRK>more than   camera blanketed the superdome on sunday afternoon  ensuring endless angle and replay of every highlight from the n f c  championship game between the new orleans saint and los angeles ram <BRK>at stake wa a trip to next month s super bowl  but when the official needed a replay most  the n f l  s complicated rule for what is and is not subject to video review prohibited them from watching one  even in the midst of a game that cost ten of million of dollar to produce and is among the most watched event on television <BRK>so  despite dizzying rule change and stunning camera angle all aimed at getting the call right  the decision came down to a simple fact  the most important guy wa standing in the wrong place at the wrong time and nobody could do anything about it <BRK>those rule might change this off seaon  though in the pat the n f l  ha shown little appetite for making penalty reviewable because they are considered judgment call  this mean that ruling of fact   such a whether a ball crossed the goal line  or a foot touched the sideline  or whether a pas is complete   are reviewable  whether a player committed holding or pas interference is not <BRK>in the minute after a crucial late game play on which referee could have called two separate penalty on ram cornerback nickell robey coleman but opted to call none  fox s broadcat team showed five separate replay that made clear official had made a terrible mistake  it appeared to cost the saint an advantage that could have led to their winning the game  a those replay rolled  the side judge gary cavaletto  who wa near the play  endured an earful from saint coach sean payton <BRK>however  in an era when anyone watching on a high definition television at home ha a good a view a the official on the field do  a well a the benefit of reverse angle and slow motion for each play  the harsh judgment of the world most often end up carrying the day  the official screwed up <BRK>the saint owner gayle benson rendered her judgment in an emotional statement issued late monday afternoon  vowing to make sure no team ever experience what hers did sunday <BRK> i have been in touch with the n f l  regarding yesterday s event and will aggressively pursue change in n f l  policy to ensure no team and fan base is ever put in a similar position again   benson said   the n f l  must always commit to providing the most basic of expectation   fairness and integrity  <BRK>the league declined to issue a statement about what will undoubtedly become one of the most notorious non call in the league s history  an n f l  spokesman  brian mccarthy  also declined to comment when asked about the play  the head official for the game  bill vinovich  told a pool reporter after the game that he had not seen the play  pointing out that play involving potential pas interference are not reviewable <BRK>the closest thing to an official league position came from payton  the saint  head coach  after the game  he said he had spoken on the phone with alberto riveron  the n f l  s senior vice president of officiating  who told him the official botched the call  a position the league chose not to refute <BRK>while the relative silence may seem odd in the age of very public apology and mea culpas  the n f l  actually ha no consistent strategy for dealing with high profile officiating error  a reflection of what is often an idiosyncratic approach to crisis management  sometime roger goodell  the league s commissioner  chooses to say plenty  other time he say nothing at all <BRK>when it come to major officiating mistake  oftentimes what happened doe not become clear until year later  when the official involved chooses to speak <BRK>bill leavy can t forget super bowl xl  a an n f l  referee  officiating the biggest game of the seaon should have been an honor for leavy  instead  it is the night he will always remember for all the wrong reaons <BRK>leavy and his crew made several controversial call that went against the seattle seahawks  who ended up losing to the pittsburgh steelers      the league tried to protect leavy s crew when it said the game wa  properly officiated  <BRK>year later  leavy acknowledged the missed call and said they still weighed on him <BRK> it left me with a lot of sleepless night  and i think about it constantly   leavy told reporter in seattle in    four year after the game   i ll go to my grave wishing that i d been better  <BRK>video replay wa supposed to rectify much of that  the former n f l  coach mike holmgren refers to it a the    guy in a bar  rule  if   people watching in a bar agree it s a bad call  it should probably be overturned  yet  like a lot of thing that happen in the n f l   which ha a dense    page rule book  it is never that simple <BRK>cavaletto might want to heed leavy s remorse  cavaletto  the side judge in the n f c  championship game on sunday  ha been widely ridiculed for not calling a penalty late in the fourth quarter on robey coleman  who drilled new orleans saint receiver tommylee lewis before the ball arrived <BRK>cavaletto  who did not grant an interview  and the other referee could have called penalty for pas interference or a helmet to helmet hit  but they chose to call neither <BRK>the saint settled for a field goal  but enough time remained on the clock for the ram to march down the field and kick a field goal that sent the game into overtime  the ram ended up winning the game      <BRK> it wa simple  they blew the call   payton said after the game <BRK>cavaletto     spent most of his n f l  career a a field judge before becoming a sideline judge before the   seaon  he worked super bowl xlvi in    between the giant and new england patriot <BRK>he is a   graduate of bishop diego high school in santa barbara  calif   where he played football  baeball and baketball  cavaletto later played part of three seaon in the atlanta brave minor league system  a a first baeman <BRK>after wahing out of baeball  cavaletto became a three sport official  officiating division i college baketball and baeball game  a well a canadian football league and arena football league game  before making his n f l  debut in   <BRK>he  too  will most likely live with his non call for year to come <BRK>in the past  official involved in controversial call have not worked subsequent game involving the aggrieved team  it is a good bet  then  that cavaletto will not be seen at future saint game <BRK>infuriated saint fan  who have long insisted that the n f l  remains biased against them because it coach were found to have rewarded injuring opponent  took to social medium after the game to note that cavaletto life a mere two hour from los angeles <BRK>his non call may also lead to change <BRK>that is  after all  what happened after a series of mistake involving the n f l  s so called  tuck rule  <BRK>the most famous invocation of that rule came during a playoff game in    when a fumble patriot quarterback tom brady wa overturned and ruled an incomplete pas after a replay review the referee walt coleman  brady s arm  coleman ruled  had begun a forward movement before he attempted to tuck the ball back toward his body  the patriot went on to defeat the oakland raider in overtime <BRK>while the n f l  elected to leave the rule a is following that game  a push to make a change began in earnest after another instance in a   playoff game between the baltimore raven and the kansa city chief  finally  in    after continued consternation over the regulation  the n f l  abolished the tuck rule <BRK>even though coleman officiated for   season after the game before retiring this year  he never officiated another raider game
