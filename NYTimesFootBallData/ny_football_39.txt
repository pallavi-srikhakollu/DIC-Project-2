 <BRK>  <BRK> by ken belson and victor mather <BRK> kareem hunt  the former kansa city chief star running back who wa captured on video pushing and kicking a woman  wa suspended without pay for the first eight game of the regular season the n f l  on friday  <BRK> hunt  who joined the cleveland brown in february  a year after the incident  will not appeal the suspension  which will mean he will miss the first half of the season  <BRK> the n f l  said in a statement that the suspension came in connection with a physical altercation at his residence in cleveland last february and at a resort in ohio last june  <BRK> the league recently completed it investigation  which it said included  reviewing available law enforcement record  video and electronic communication  interview with numerous witness  and multiple interview with hunt   <BRK> the eight game suspension  which will start at the beginning of the regular season  is one of the heaviest for player involved in abuse and violence case  <BRK> the league s handling of these cae ha been under intense scrutiny since    when commissioner roger goodell suspended ray rice for two game after video emerged of him punching his fiancée  the suspension wa roundly criticized a too short  and goodell later apologized and strengthened penalty for violence and abuse  <BRK> le than two week later  more vivid video of rice punching his fiancée wa published the celebrity website tmz  the league suspended rice indefinitely  a penalty that wa later overturned  and he ha never returned to the n f l  the league s policy and investigative ability have also been tested in abuse case involving greg hardy  adrian peterson  josh brown and other player  <BRK> the n f l  ha hired former prosecutor and others with experience in investigating misconduct case  even so  the league ha had to walk a fine line between taking a tough stand against violence against woman and waiting to complete it investigation before deciding whether to penalize a player or league executive  <BRK> in the incident at hunt s residence  an upscale apartment in downtown cleveland  the videotaped altercation with a woman did not result in a police case  hunt pushed a   year old woman  and wa then held back other men  he broke free  and the woman fell down in the chaos  hunt then kicked her  in the resort incident several month later  hunt is accused of punching a man in the face  no charge were filed in that case either  <BRK> the case renewed debate and discussion over how seriously the n f l  investigates and punishes player  behavior off the field  particularly fight and assault that are reported but do not result in police charge  <BRK> an examination of the league s investigation show that the n f l  relied heavily on the word of the chief  who had a vested interest in keeping their star running back on the field  and did not press to independently verify the account of the incident that hunt gave to them  <BRK> when the video emerged in november  the n f l  suspended hunt  though it had learned of the altercation month earlier  the chief  who also knew of the incident long before  then released him  <BRK> the n f l  said it wa unable to obtain the video  which tmz published  league official suggested that tmz had paid for the video  which they said the league would not do for fear others might try to extort money from the n f l  <BRK> hunt had starred a a rookie for the team in    leading the league in rushing yard  and had played well again in his second seaon  gaining   yard in   game  <BRK> in february  hunt wa signed the brown  john dorsey  the general manager  said   given what we know about kareem through our extensive research  we believe he deserves a second chance   <BRK> in the announcement  hunt wa quoted a saying   first off  i would like to once again apologize for my action lat year  what i did wa wrong and inexcusable   <BRK> signing hunt wa a risk because he faced disciplinary action from the league  but the brown have been eager to make over the once woeful team  after     and     season  the team  led the promising rookie quarterback baker mayfield  raced to a       record in the   season  it best since    hope are high for an even better season next year  on tuesday the team traded for the receiving superstar odell beckham jr  from the giant  <BRK> hunt grew up in a suburb of cleveland and went to the university of toledo  <BRK> the brown are not the only team willing to sign a player under a cloud  in    the cowboy signed hardy  a defensive lineman who had been convicted of beating his girlfriend  the case wa dismissed on appeal  the n f l  suspended hardy for   game  but the penalty wa reduced to four game on appeal  <BRK> in november  the redskin claimed linebacker reuben foster off waiver after he wa released the san francisco  er day after he wa arrested in tampa  fla   on a misdemeanor domestic violence charge  <BRK> the league suspended foster indefinitely with pay  but the redskin signed him anyway  the charge against foster were dropped in january  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
