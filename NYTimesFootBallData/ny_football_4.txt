 <BRK>  <BRK> by david waldstein <BRK> cambridge  mas    one of the most infamous dropped pas in football history clanged off dalla cowboy tight end jackie smith a he lay in the end zone during super bowl xiii  <BRK> poor smith  forty year ago  he had only his bare hand to try to pull in roger staubach s low pas  had he played in a more recent edition of the n f l  playoff  he almost certainly would have been wearing a pair of the sticky  silicone glove that have transformed receiver  mitt into virtual spider man hand  <BRK> the technological advance on the skin of those glove have been so profound that they now enable receiver to snare pass their forebear never dreamed of catching  and in making the seemingly impossible possible  they may be changing the way football is played  <BRK> the grippy polymer used on the new generation of glove  said to be developed first a canadian wide receiver and a chemist in a pakistan laboratory in    is about   percent stickier than a human hand   according to a recent study the m i t  sport lab performed at the request of the new york time  <BRK> the technology ha made life easier for receiver at all level  of course  and now it is rare for any player in search of a better grip   pas catcher  but also quarterback  running back and tight end   not to make them part of his standard equipment  even defender have taken to wearing them  <BRK>  the glove definitely help with the one handed catch   said rasul douglas  a cornerback for the philadelphia eagle who wear a nike version   you rarely see guy making one handed catch without glove on   <BRK> for those who have not played any football in the last   year  just touch a pair at a sporting good store  it will be obvious why the glove  now manufactured several company  are probably the most significant performance related football equipment innovation since the advent of the cleat  <BRK>  there s no long term statistical data that i ve seen   said rich mckay  the chief executive of the atlanta falcon and the chairman of the n f l  s competition committee   but they definitely make some difference  there s no doubt about that   <BRK> when a catch is made  the naked eye often see only hand grabbing a ball  but what is happening on the palm of a receiver s glove is far more complex  the scientific principle of polymer adhesion and the miracle of a molecular chain of silicon and oxygen that creates polysiloxanes   viscoelatic substance commonly known a silicone rubber  silicone is used to make a wide range of product  including caulk  kitchen tool and silly putty  receiver use it to make highlight reel play  <BRK> according to sanat kumar  a professor of chemical engineering at columbia university and a specialist in polymer  the sticky property exhibited in a viscoelatic medium arises because the material act a both a solid and a liquid  <BRK>  it is macroscopically a solid   kumar explained of the silicone   but at shorter  microscopic length  it is liquidlike   <BRK> that liquidlike property make it sticky  imagine a tight spiral thrown onto a hard surface like a road  it skip right off  now imagine the same ball chucked into a large puddle of honey  the honey make the grab  that is because the silicone surface of the glove is  at the microscopic level  a viscous  honeylike liquid  and when a football come in contact with it  the ball stall in it the way it would on the surface of a gooey liquid  like the honey  the ball must work to get through it  <BRK> anette hosoi  a co director of the m i t  sport lab and an associate dean of engineering at m i t   is an expert on the interface of soft material  she and her student conducted experiment on a pair of blue under armour ua f  glove last week to quantify their tackiness  basically measuring the force required to pull a leather wilson football over both the glove and over a bare hand  in both dry and wet condition  <BRK> the experiment were led sarah fay  an m i t  doctoral candidate  who determined the glove had a coefficient of friction of     when dry  which is roughly   percent more grip force than that of a bare hand      cof   <BRK>  fay also noted that statistically and perhaps surprisingly  there is no significant difference between the friction of a wet glove and a wet hand   <BRK> looking over a pair of under armour glove in her office near the charles river  hosoi said the key to their performance wa how soft and deformable the silicone is  meaning it cover and adheres to the tiniest variation on the surface of the ball  enabling it to almost melt into them  <BRK>  every time you get more deformable  you get a better adhesion   hosoi said after slipping on a pair and palming a leather football with her left hand  <BRK> but a any coach or eagle fan know  adhesion alone doe not guarantee catch  a dougla  the eagle cornerback  said before lat week s loss to the new orleans saint   there s people with glove on who are still dropping pases every game   <BRK> the birth of the current generation of superglove can be traced to a wintry day at the university of ottawa in    a receiver named jeff beraznik  who would later found cutter sport glove  noticed a star player from rival calgary  donnavan blair  fielding practice punt with one hand while wearing a pair of orange glove  <BRK> the next year  beraznik called calgary s equipment manager and learned that blair wa wearing glass cutter  glove   rubbery mitt designed to protect worker and do it yourselfers from cut from glass edge  those glove  he found  could be purchased at any hardware store  <BRK> beraznik bought a pair and modified them to fit more snugly  they were not perfect  he said  but they were good enough  and once beraznik s teammate stopped making fun of him  they all wanted a pair of their own  <BRK>  the whole team wa  like  pas me a pair of those glass cutter glove   beraznik said  hence the name of his company  cutter  <BRK> beraznik spent   month after college traveling the world seeking the perfect material  one that wa stickier but also le bulky  he teamed with a safety glove company in toronto called midas  which sent him to a lab outside karachi  pakistan  to work with one of it chemist  <BRK> with a football in hand  beraznik made repeated trip to karachi in the late  s  at time rolling up his sleeve to work on the formula   adding a little more of this and a little le of that  one day  he and one of the chemist arrived at the current formula  which wa dubbed c tack  <BRK> the modern glove  a huge improvement on the scuba diving glove worn n f l  receiver at the time  wa born  other manufacturer  including a company founded jim sandusky  another canadian football player   were working on similar product  eventually nike  reebok  under armour and others produced their own  <BRK> even lester hayes  the former oakland raider cornerback who wa known for smearing his hand and body with a ridiculously sticky goop in the  s  wa impressed  after he came across a pair of cutter  he sent a handwritten letter to beraznik  <BRK>  this is the greatest invention since stickem   he wrote  <BRK> that product  known it brand name  stickum  wa outlawed the n f l  in   because of the utter mess it made   sticking not only to user  but also to opponent  referee and the ball themselves  the silicone glove are allowed because they leave no residue on the ball  according to rule    section    article    item   of the n f l  rule book   player may wear glove with a tackified surface if such tacky substance doe not adhere to the football or otherwise cause handling problem for player   <BRK> the most obvious result of the glove can be seen in the startling one handed catch that came into fashion after odell beckham jr  of the giant made the most famous of all one handed grab against the dallas cowboy in    now almost everyone   in the n f l   college and even high school   ha done it  <BRK> in the rose bowl this month  hunter bryant  a sophomore tight end at the university of wahington  leapt for a high pas in the final two minute of that game and palmed the ball with his gloved right hand  by using only one hand  he wa able to extend his reach and fend off his opponent  <BRK> in a telephone interview  bryant said that like most player today  he ha worn silicone glove since he played youth football  but once he saw beckham s gloved acrobatic snare on sunday  he began practicing them  <BRK>  everyone practice them now   he said   i ve gotten pretty good at it   <BRK> hunter also noted that he feel he can sometimes get a better grip with bare hand  but he wear those sticky glove anyway  he doesn t want to find himself lying in the end zone without the ball one day  wringing his bare hand the way jackie smith once did  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
