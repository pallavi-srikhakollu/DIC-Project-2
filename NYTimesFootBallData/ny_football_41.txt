 <BRK>  <BRK> to root for the former home team or not  it s a question for which there is no right answer  especially in a laid back city on the ocean  <BRK> by ken belson <BRK> san diego  <BRK> a question of unrivaled consequence ha descended on this picturesque seaside city  should the good citizen root for or against the charger  the football team that abandoned them a season ago but didn t go really all that far   <BRK> in year past  the team s surprising success would be cause for widespread celebration  fan would proudly wear team jersey and cap  bar would overflow with viewing party  and the team would dominate water cooler talk  the charger went     in the regular season  beat the baltimore raven on the road in an a f c  wild card game  and now have a chance to topple the new england patriot in foxborough  mass   on sunday in the divisional round  <BRK> but ambivalence ha dominated san diego s cool ocean breeze of late  after a long  messy fight over funding for a new stadium in san diego that wa never built  the charger left for los angeles in    forcing legion of jilted fan to decide whether to follow the team north  or wah their hand of the beloved bolt  <BRK> last year  the team began with four loss and missed the playoff a game  which made it easier for bereft fan to move on  talk radio host trashed the team  an angry fan flew scathing banner over the team s new home in carson  about a   minute drive south of los angeles  without traffic   and one restaurant owner gave out free taco after every charger loss  <BRK> now the charger have returned to the postseason for the first time since    recording their most win in nearly a decade  the calculus ha changed  <BRK> some fan are creeping back  making the   mile drive to carson to watch the team or packing team friendly bar on game day  for other fan  the charger  success ha deepened their resentment  <BRK>  it s been a civil war and it s getting worse because the team is good   said johnny abundez  who is part of the fan group bolt pride and ha been attacked for his continued allegiance   the fight for san diego ha gotten personal   <BRK> the rancor reached a fresh peak this week  after the charger upset the raven  a detractor on twitter encouraged people to write bad review on yelp of cali comfort bbq  a sport bar whose owner  shawn walchef  who ha stood the charger and host popular viewing party on game day  <BRK>  it s o k  to disagree  but not to be disagreeable   said walchef  who ha four charger season ticket at dignity health sport park  the team s temporary home  <BRK> fan and former fan in san diego have been bickering for year over whether to support the charger  but the effort to destroy someone s business crossed a line  a host of people jumped to walchef s defense  including one of the team s most vocal opponent  victor lopez  who owns el pollo grill  a mexican restaurant  <BRK> lopez     is the restaurateur who wa so angry that the team abandoned his hometown that he began giving out taco after the team lost  the line went out the door on monday and tuesday after defeat  he ha given away about     taco  his estimate  but the publicity ha brought lopez an unexpected windfall  while some charger faithful stopped coming to his restaurant  many others have flocked  <BRK> lopez said sale were up about   percent because of the promotion   but i d give it all back to get my team back   he added  <BRK> still  the attack on walchef were too much  and lopez  who said he once received a death threat  ha defended his fellow restaurateur  in the spirit of civility  they made a bet  if the charger beat the patriot on sunday  lopez will feed walchef s staff  if the patriot come out on top  walchef will send barbecue to lopez s worker  the loser will also donate to a gofundme campaign to help a local sport radio show host whose son recently died  <BRK> the passion over loyalty to the charger in san diego are a distant battle in los angeles  where the team is trying to find a foothold  the team play in a small soccer stadium where visiting fan are often out in force  raising question about whether the charger will be able to fill the     seat stadium they will share with the ram starting in    <BRK> the team s recent success ha eased some of those concern  sale of seat license at the new stadium being built in inglewood have been brisk immediately after charger victory  television viewership ha ticked up in los angeles  and san diego  after the team pulled off dramatic victory in seattle  pittsburgh  kansa city and baltimore  the charger are hopeful the team s resurgence will help them lock in key sponsor and a naming right partner  <BRK>  timing is everything   dean spanos  the team s owner  said at the charger  practice facility in costa mesa this week   monday morning are great when you win the playoff   <BRK> still  winning over fan in los angeles will take time  the charger previously played just one season in los angeles  in    the city is filled with transplant who root for their hometown team  and local adopted other team during the n f l  s two decade absence from the market  <BRK> the ram  who arrived from st  louis in    have also battled the perception they are unloved in their new old home  the team ha a longer history in los angeles  having played in the area for nearly   year  but ram home game are on occasion overflowing with fan of the visiting team at the cavernous los angeles memorial coliseum  <BRK> still  the ram  who have won their division two straight year  are further ahead than the charger  the team s attendance jumped   percent this year  and it television rating grew   percent compared with last season  when the ram  game against the chief wa moved to los angeles from mexico city  the team sold more than     ticket in just five day  <BRK> kevin demoff  the ram  chief operating officer  said that although it will take year to fully win over fan in the city  interest in the team is likely to grow when it new stadium open  already  the team ha sold out it inventory of top priced seat license  which cost      each  <BRK>  once you add this new stadium  and the seen and be seen factor  it will dial up the brand   he said  <BRK> the charger  though  are in an unusual position  while most fan in st  louis have washed their hand of the ram  the charger  biggest group of supporter are within driving distance  though many are unwilling to make the trek to carson  <BRK>  i understand how the san diego fan feel   spanos said   i knew coming up here it wa going to take maybe a generation to build that kind of fan base   <BRK> in the meantime  fan in san diego are searching for a new identity  some fan like walchef plan to buy season ticket at the team s new stadium  others support the team but refuse to buy charger gear with the word  los angeles  on it  a few fan travel to carson to tailgate but refuse to enter the stadium  <BRK> the issue ha split some family  dave abrams  a retired city planner and longtime season ticket holder  is in the never again camp  his wife  however  still support the team  so abrams ha taken to rooting for the charger  opponent  <BRK>  they left and it wa a kick in the gut for me  and i ve been an anti fan since then   said abrams  who is donating all of his charger gear to charity   my biggest fear is they ll get to the super bowl  we love a lot of the player  like philip river  but i can t get past what the ownership did to the city   <BRK> river  who ha played his entire career with the charger  still life in san diego  he ha urged resident to stay classy amid the consternation  <BRK>  san diego will always be special for me  and for many of u   he said   you hope that some of those fan can be happy and be excited for the team they cheered for  we know that many of them may not  we know it is a hard decision and position to be in  <BRK> ken belson cover the n f l  he joined the sport section in   after stint in metro and business  from   to    he wrote about japan in the tokyo bureau    <BRK>  <BRK>
