<BRK><BRK>sport of the time<BRK>by michael powell<BRK>so a compelling two year run of american political and cultural theater come to a deeply unsatisfying conclusion  colin kaepernick  a once brilliant young quarterback  chose to take a knee for his belief and endured apparent blackballing the most powerful sport league in north america <BRK>it would be churlish to criticize this man for taking an unspecified financial settlement and signing a nondisclosure agreement with the national football league after he had accused the league s team of colluding to keep him out  he sacrificed for his belief and with a dignified use of free speech  that grandest of american tradition  he came to personify a coming of political age across several sport <BRK>he persevered despite spray of vitriol from this nation s president  donald j  trump  who in   used the specter of this black man to stir resentment <BRK> wouldn t you love to see one of those n f l  owner  when someone disrespect our flag  to say   get that son of a bitch off the field right now  out  he s fired  he s fired     trump told a crowd in alabama <BRK>it wa catnip for the vastly white crowd that roared in disgust over kaepernick <BRK>it is galling that kaepernick and his former teammate eric reid  who joined him in the protest and legal action  must remain mum about the corruption of the industrial complex known a the n f l  the owner almost certainly conspired to blackball kaepernick  ensuring that he would never throw another pas in the league <BRK>a he sought to sign on with a new team for the seaon after his protest began  and le than five year after he had taken the  er to the super bowl  owner came up with ever more pathetic excuse for refusing to sign a quarterback so swift and so strong of arm <BRK>now he can say nothing about that travesty  it feel a bit like the freedom rider integrating a lunch counter and agreeing not to talk about it <BRK>i called ira glasser  a former director of the american civil liberty union who is also a deep dyed sport fan  he resolutely declined to second guess kaepernick for surveying the ruin of his career and probably taking a large chunk of money <BRK> he wa a star who burst upon the scene explosively  and maybe he extracted a much justice a he could from this situation   glaser said   but it doe leave a stain on the n f l  that ought not to be eradicated in the public mind  <BRK>kaepernick did not burn a flag or even hold a proud fist aloft  it s a measure of the subtle nature of his protest that fan and sportswriter went three preseason game before they noticed that  oh yeah  kaepernick wa sitting out the national anthem <BRK>when they asked the young quarterback about it  he talked about police brutality and too many dead black american   to me this is bigger than football  and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way  <BRK>in the next game and thereafter  kaepernick took a knee instead  at the suggestion of a military veteran  yet the whirlwind of anger somehow gained in force <BRK>in the first week of that season  i flew to san francisco to draw his measure  to step into the  er postgame locker room wa to find a remarkably composed man with the support of many teammate  he walked out of the shower that night and slipped a form fitting shirt over a lithe  tattooed torso  then he turned to a bristling array of microphone and camera and calmly answered every question <BRK>are you proud  a reporter asked him  of your role in stirring player around the n f l    several knelt or raised fist sunday during the various anthem   to protest  kaepernick  a new arrival to the world of political activism  shook his head  no air  man  no air <BRK> no  no   he said   this movement wan t for me  a i ve researched these thing  a i ve seen more and more  it s not right  <BRK>he spoke instead of how social medium and reading and looking at photograph online had driven home to him how many black were dying at the hand of the police <BRK> you see thing instantly  day after day  and it s hard   he told u before citing some of the casualty   for me  i couldn t see another hashtag sandra bland  hashtag tamir rice  hashtag walter scott  <BRK> at what point   he continued   do we take a stand  <BRK>it wa dissent  yes  and a unthreatening and american a you could find in a country so often given over now to partisan fury  a glaser  the civil libertarian  said to me friday   if that s not acceptable to this country  what is it that we are supposed to be fighting for  <BRK>colin kaepernick the football player may soon move into history s mist  kaepernick the human right activist  the man amnesty international named an ambassador of conscience  may just be coming into his own <BRK>you hope only that this young man walked away with a mother lode from the league without shame <BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK>
