<BRK><BRK>meet romostradamus  savor romomania  and behold the beauty of real expertise in a country starved of it <BRK>by frank bruni<BRK>opinion columnist<BRK>the super bowl arrives and  with it  so many question big and small  is tom brady part cyborg and maybe even immortal  will the los angeles ram be hamstrung the knowledge that they got this far the grace of several sleepwalking referee <BRK>how frequently will tony romo see the future  and might our fascination with that speak to a longing that reach far beyond football <BRK>but first a quick primer on romo  cbs s dependably psychic commentator  over the course of two season analyzing national football league game from the broadcast booth  he ha provided more than the usual blather and banter  he guess what will happen next  blitz or no blitz  run or pas  involving this wide receiver or that tight end  he doen t do this for every play  but he doe it repeatedly  and if he were picking stock on wall street  he d be a gazillionaire <BRK>romo hit peak prognostication when he announced the game two week ago in which brady and the new england patriot eked past the kansa city chief  earning yet another trip to the super bowl  he made   specific forecast  thirteen were correct  on the two occasion when the team on offense bucked romo s soothsaying   the result were poor   one play ended with an incomplete pas  and the other with a turnover   noted zach helfand in the new yorker   it seemed that  even when romo wa wrong  he wa right  <BRK>romo     previously spent more than a decade a a quarterback for the dalla cowboy  he wa great but he wan t great  and with him a it leader  the team never went all the way  in a twist that s testament to second act in american life  he s doing something a a star for cbs that he never did a a star for the cowboy  going to the super bowl  i suppose that s fitting  because he s more than great in his current gig  he s peerless  and he s a sensation <BRK>so much so that after the patriot chief game  reporter for the wall street journal studied   hour of television footage from this past football season to review the     play that romo had provided live commentary for  not even the nixon tape got scrutiny like that  the journal found   instance when romo prophesied what a team wa about to do  the team did what he said   percent of the time <BRK> a broadcasting phenomenon  is how the journal describes romo  twitter call him romostradamus  football fan gush about romomania  and this is obviously about more than the novelty of his crystal ball <BRK>it s about the rarity of his unquestionably deep knowledge in an era when so many of the people who put on the trapping of authority and peddle pearl of wisdom don t actually have the good  when so many opinion come with a swagger inversely proportional to their worth  when social medium  cable channel  webcasts  podcasts  blog and more have created an environment in which everybody s an expert and nobody s an expert   in which it s sometimes impossible to tell <BRK>with romo you can tell  his verified foresight prof his genuine insight <BRK>a i ve savored his genius and reflected on it appeal  i ve flahed back to some comment that president obama made to the new yorker s top editor  david remnick  for a lengthy article in late november   about his waning day in office  obama wa obsessed with the chaotic nature of this new information ecosystem   everything is true and nothing is true   he told remnick   an explanation of climate change from a nobel prize winning physicist look exactly the same on your facebook page a the denial of climate change somebody on the koch brother  payroll  <BRK>i also flashed back to another article  amy zegart  that appeared in the atlantic the following summer  it defined the  three paradox disrupting american politics   the first of which wa  more information  le credibility  <BRK> the volume of data is exploding  and yet credible information is harder to find   zegart wrote   why  because the barrier to entry are so low   you don t need a printing press  a book contract or the approval of some gatekeeper to have your say and share your thought  you just need an internet connection  and while there s obvious benefit to that   judgment and permission aren t the exclusive province of a discriminatory elite   there s obvious danger  too  good filter disappear with the bad one  cyberspace is at once a smorgasbord and a junkyard <BRK>romo s habitat   network television   is old fashioned  but that s not what distinguishes and recommends him  his seriousness set him apart  i don t mean his style  which helfand likened to  that of a   year old who s really into dinosaur showing his uncle the t  rex exhibit at the american museum of natural history   i mean his content  he played football recently and ha studied it closely  so he understands what the athlete are thinking  what the coach are plotting  what make sense on third down and what doesn t  he us the day between the game that he s announcing to bone up on the team that will come under his gaze  even interviewing their member  while he come his charisma naturally  he make it a point to be informed <BRK>how refreshing  and what an excellent reminder he is that hugely successful athlete aren t just physically gifted  they re mentally tough  and many are smart  their sport pivot on intricate strategy a much a brute strength  to the agile thinker go the spoil  ever listened to one of those lebron james news conference right after a baketball game  he remembers and can deconstruct every second of it  it s all there in his brain <BRK>romo found glory aplenty on the football field  but he began to find even greater glory the minute he stepped off it in late    with a farewell speech that wa like the climactic monologue in one of those sport movie that ha grown men working every last muscle and tendon in their face not to cry <BRK> i just want to leave you with something i ve learned in this process   he said  referring to his quarterbacking year   i feel like we all have two battle or two enemy going on  one with the man across from you  the second is with the man inside of you  i think once you control the one inside of you  the one across from you really doesn t matter  <BRK>emotional intelligence along with clairvoyance  that s no everyday combination  but then he s no everyday oracle  you can tune in to the super bowl to marvel at brady  chuckle over the commercial and gripe about the halftime show  or you can come for romo  he alone is lure enough  <BRK>the time is committed to publishing a diversity of letter to the editor  we d like to hear what you think about this or any of our article  here
