<BRK><BRK>the victory over the chief mean tom brady and co  will be playing for the title for the ninth time in the last two decade  <BRK>by bill pennington and benjamin hoffman<BRK>a tom brady led the new england patriot down the field in the crucible of overtime  there wa a familiar sense of inevitability  an atmosphere that wa both tense and predictable  these were only the latest minute in a cavalcade of triumphant overtime postseaon patriot moment that stretch from a snowy game in   to the one played in frigid condition here sunday night <BRK>more of brady s pas failed than succeeded in the overtime period against the kansa city chief  but all the one that mattered most were reliably rifled into the arm of his receiver  a the patriot neared the chief  goal line  a winning touchdown and a ninth patriot super bowl appearance this century seemed preordained <BRK>when running back rex burkhead pushed into the end zone with the game ending touchdown in the patriot     victory  brady began jumping up and down a he turned toward his team s sideline <BRK>in the patriot  locker room a short while later  new england wide receiver julian edelman  who caught two overtime pass from brady  said of his quarterback   there s no one i d rather have in two minute drill than no     it s in his dna  he ha a clutch gene  <BRK>brady  meanwhile  focused elsewhere <BRK> i m so tired   he said   that wa a hell of a game  <BRK>the patriot have played in many such game  in almost every season this decade they stumbled enough that it appeared the long run at the highest level of success must surely be nearing it expiration date  and then there s another game like sunday when the patriot  despite squandering a first half lead  nonetheless held off one of the most potent offense in the n f l  to persevere and qualify for their third consecutive super bowl and fifth in the last eight year <BRK>new england will play the los angeles ram in super bowl liii on feb    in atlanta   which happens to be the  th anniversary of new england s super bowl victory over the ram  who were then based in st  louis <BRK>after a fourth quarter that featured five touchdown from both team  the patriot received the football first in overtime  brady twice pierced the chief defense with dart like throw on third down to edelman to keep the drive alive  soon the patriot were at the kansa city   yard line  but two brady throw   one on a flea flicker   fell incomplete <BRK>on third down  brady rifled a pas to tight end rob gronkowski for   yard  burkhead then carried the football on three successive play  with the last ending the game <BRK> overtime  on the road against a great team   they had fight  they had no quit   brady said of the chief in an interview with cbs after the game <BRK>the patriot  who ran twice a many play a the chief did on sunday  had taken a     lead late in the fourth quarter on a drive aided a roughing the paser penalty and an   yard  one handed reception new england wide receiver chris hogan  on  th and   from kansa city s   yard line  sony michel  who had   rushing yard  burst through the middle  giving his team a lead with just   minute and   second left to play <BRK>the chief responded quickly  regaining the lead in five play and le than   second when a pas interference penalty and a   yard pas to wide receiver sammy watkins led to a   yard touchdown run damien williams <BRK>with just over two minute to play  brady got the ball and marched his team down the field  with burkhead bulling into the end zone to put new england ahead       with   second left in the game <BRK>quarterback patrick mahomes coolly led the chief back  going   yard in just two play  and with   second remaining  kansa city s kicker  harrison butker  sent the game into overtime with a   yard field goal that tied the game      <BRK>kansa city had trailed     after the opening two quarter   the first time since coach andy reid took over the team in   that the chief had failed to score in the first half   but the team came out for the third quarter invigorated  scoring a touchdown le than two minute into the half <BRK>it wa the patriot who looked more energized amid frigid temperature at first  new england opened the game with a   play    yard masterpiece of precision and versatility  consistently confusing the chief  defense and keeping it backpedaling for more than eight consecutive minute of playing time <BRK>the tone of the opening drive wa set on the first new england play from scrimmage  when michel sliced through a gaping hole in the middle of the kansa city front line for an   yard gain <BRK>the patriot stuck to the ground to convert on essential third down play behind all purpose running back james white <BRK>the chief linebacker began sneaking toward the line of scrimmage  and brady saw them  changing a play in a pre snap read and throwing over the middle to edelman for   yard <BRK>and so went the cat and mouse game  with white s backfield mate michel dashing for   yard to kansa city s   yard line  three play later  from the   yard line  behind crushing block gronkowski and fullback james develin  michel leapt into the end zone for a     new england lead <BRK>after the chief lost six yard on their initial possession  the patriot  next drive  which began in chief territory  wa nearly a efficient <BRK>white plowed through hole in the chief  defense  and a well timed shovel pas in the backfield to wide receiver cordarrelle patterson gained   yard  edelman caught another pas and soon the patriot were a yard from the kansa city goal line again  but on a third down  brady faked a handoff  bent at the waist to hide the ball and popped up and lofted a quick pas toward the   foot   gronkowski breaking across the middle <BRK>brady did not see chief linebacker reggie ragland standing in the path of his throw  ragland made the interception and the chief narrowly avoided falling behind two touchdown <BRK>but when the chief went on offense  they continued to look out of sync and frustrated  the patriot were successfully pressuring mahomes  forcing him to flee the pocket and rush his throw <BRK>the chief offense had only one first down near the midpoint of the second quarter when the patriot appeared to have mahomes corralled for a sack on a third down play  mahomes instead slipped a tackle and fired a   pas to watkins <BRK>on the next play  the chief  fatest player  tyreek hill  got behind his defender for a   yard reception  suddenly  it wa the patriot defense that seemed to be unsteady  especially on the succeeding play when williams  the chief running back  wa left uncovered a he ran a pas route into the new england end zone <BRK>in a costly mistake  mahomes overthrew the wide open williams  a sack of mahomes eventually moved the chief  who would gain just   yard offensively in the first half  out of field goal range <BRK>on their final possession of the second quarter  brady connected with white on a   yard pa to bring the patriot within striking distance of the kansa city end zone  on a second and one  brady pumped faked to his left to draw in chief cornerback steven nelson a patriot wide receiver phillip dorsett streaked down the sideline to haul in a   yard touchdown pa that gave the patriot their     lead at intermission <BRK> the los angeles ram beat the new orleans saint       in the n f c  championship game earlier sunday  and will face the winner of this game in the super bowl  see how they did it here  <BRK>here s how the patriot beat the chief  benjamin hoffman <BRK>rex burkhead surged in from two yard out to get the patriot a     victory in overtime  before the chief ever got a chance to posse the ball <BRK>thirty nine second wa plenty of time for patrick mahomes  the second year quarterback took his team   yard on a pair of long pas  and while he wan t able to throw a touchdown pas on his third attempt  he had gotten his team close enough for harrison butker to tie thing up with a   yard field goal <BRK>new england will have just   second and this game is almost undoubtedly headed to overtime <BRK>this game ha lived up to expectation  rex burkhead blasted through the middle for a   yard touchdown run and the patriot  who seemed all but done in this game  are now leading     with just   second remaining <BRK>new england went   yard on six play and survived what appeared to be a kansa city interception that wa overturned a a result of a penalty <BRK>for mahomes there is never a down or distance too far to rule him out  but he ha a long way to go with almost no time to do it <BRK>damien williams raced up the middle for a   yard score  putting the chief up     with     left in the a f c  championship game <BRK>the chief  drive went   yard in five play  and while it had many key moment for the kansa city offense  it wa far more about mistake the new england defense  and j c  jackson  a rookie defensive back  isn t going to be very popular if the patriot lose this game <BRK>earlier in the drive  travis kelce had lost control the of the ball  and dont a hightower had recovered  giving the patriot the ball and the lead with just over   minute remaining  a late flag came out  and a defensive holding penalty on jackson had instead given kansa city a first down <BRK>it wa just two play later that jackson committed a brutal pas interference penalty that gave kansa city   yard <BRK>tom brady now ha two minute  and the patriot need a touchdown <BRK>not content to let the chief steal the game  new england marched   yard down the field  with sony michel barreling his way into the end zone for a   yard touchdown run  with the extra point  the patriot are now back on top      with     remaining in the game <BRK>kansa city s defense had tightened up considerably on it last few try  but this time around they once again fell prey to a series of short grinding play the patriot  on top of that  new england wa able to take another     off the clock  extending it lead in time of possession to     to kansa city s     <BRK>the drive wa impressive overall  but on what is proving to be a rough day for officiating   especially in new orleans   new england s drive wa extended an extremely questionable roughing the passer penalty against chris jones  the play  in which jones reached over brady s shoulder and tapped his shoulder  wa ruled on an official who wa out of position to see what type of contact wa made between jones and brady <BRK>the chief have taken the lead <BRK>given the ball in new england s territory  patrick mahomes needed just two play to put his team on top       with a   yard catch and run to damien williams in which the running back took a floater of a pas from mahomes and sprinted past the entire patriot defense on his way into the end zone <BRK>mahomes is up to three touchdown pass in the second half  and this time he capitalized on a tom brady mistake   the interception to daniel sorensen   to give his team it first lead <BRK>in a wild turn of event  the chief lost a turnover thanks to a replay review  but then got the ball back thanks to an interception daniel sorensen <BRK>it had briefly looked a if kansa city had recovered a muffed punt  a lengthy replay review determined the ball never made contact with julian edelman s hand  giving new england the ball at it own   yard line <BRK>the various replay appeared to show the ball clear edelman s hand  despite some odd movement in his thumb <BRK>considering the chief had come up with a huge stop on  th and inch on new england s previous drive  the muffed punt wa pushing the momentum of the game decidedly in kansa city s favor  while having to give the ball back had to be a blow to morale  sorensen s interception got the chief right back into it <BRK>patrick mahomes threw four touchdown pass in the second half of the chief  loss to the patriot in week    and he s already up to two in the second half of this game  his latest  a   yarder to damien williams  ha kansa city trailing new england      <BRK>the scoring drive went   yard on nine play  with the biggest highlight coming on a   yard catch and run williams  and a brutal pas interference penalty in which new england s j c  jackson mugged travis kelce in the end zone  setting the chief up with a  st and goal from new england s   yard line <BRK>on top of those play  mahomes showed some toughness on the drive  stepping out of the way of a sack attempt and racing for a   yard gain  plowing into patrick chung at the end of the play  and then picking up a first down on a sneak up the middle <BRK>a few play later  mahomes saved the drive yet again with a sidearm throw to sammy watkins for a first down  the play after that wa the huge run down the sideline williams in which the running back spun his way down the field past new england defender <BRK>the touchdown seemed all but inevitable once the chief reached the red zone  but the pas interference call against jackson made it nice and easy for mahomes to roll out and hit williams with the short pas <BRK>the patriot  lead is up to   point after stephen gostkowski connected on a   yard field goal attempt <BRK>new england had to go just   yard to set up the score after having held tight against kansa city s offense with the chief backed up inside their own   to start their previous drive  a a result  new england started the drive on the   yard line <BRK>the chief  defense acquitted itself fairly well on the latest scoring drive  holding tight on a  rd and    but thanks to the short field that didn t matter <BRK>in what could be turning into a game of field position  the patriot may have just given themselves a big advantage despite the team having traded punt <BRK>kansa city failed to do anything on it second possession of the second half  with patrick mahomes and his teammate going just   yard on five play  but the drive had started at kansa city s   yard line thanks to a brutal sequence in which tyreek hill cost himself around   yard running backward in hope of finding a seam to exploit  and a blocking penalty tacking on another   yard loss <BRK>a a result  new england will be getting the ball at the   yard line  still up     <BRK>kansa city wasted no time getting on the scoreboard in the second half  needing just     to get a   yard touchdown pas from patrick mahomes to travis kelce  the chief now trail      <BRK>thing started slowly  with damien williams picking up a combined   yard on a short reception and a short run  but mahomes saw an opportunity to do some damage on third down  and he rolled out to his right before launching the ball downfield to sammy watkins for a   yard reception that caught the patriot  second sleeping <BRK>clearly energized the play  mahomes threw aggressively to kelce in the end zone  and a he ha done so many time before  kelce wa able to control the ball in traffic and reward his quarterback s faith <BRK>a mostly quiet first half ended with the chief going out meekly  a patrick mahomes momentarily lost the ball on a strip sack fumble before he recovered it and simply knelt on the ball to send his team to the locker room  down     <BRK>while the score is still relatively close  new england ha dictated the tone of the game  the patriot have exploited the chief  front seven with a series of short pas and run   not allowing kansa city s top pas rusher any time to get to tom brady   and new england s defense ha mostly contained the chief  offense <BRK>that ha resulted in a huge disparity in playing time  with new england s offense holding the ball for     compared to     for the chief <BRK>there wa a brief glimpse of what mahomes is capable of on two completion in the second quarter in which he wa able to deal with the new england pas rush and find his receiver deep downfield  but that drive produced nothing after a sack pushed kansa city out of field goal range <BRK>beyond those two throw  mahomes s pass have been off the mark  and damien williams ha gotten nowhere with the running game  the chief were outgained    to    in total yardage <BRK>this year s chief scored the third most point in n f l  history  so it is hard to declare them out of any game they play regardless of the score  but kansa city coach andy reid will need to heavily adjust his strategy on both side of the ball if he want to get back into the game <BRK>in the one small bit of good news for the chief  they will receive the ball to start the second half <BRK>the second quarter had nearly ground to a halt thanks to a series of punt  but new england woke up in the final minute of the first half  with tom brady finding phillip dorsett for a   yard touchdown reception that  along with the extra point  ha new england up      <BRK>the patriot  latest long drive went   yard on eight play and ha left kansa city with just enough time to run one or two play   or kneel on the ball   to end the half <BRK>the chief  defense  after failing a series of test to start the game  came up huge on  rd and goal  with reggie ragland intercepting tom brady s pas attempt to rob gronkowski  thus stealing some momentum back for kansa city <BRK>up until that point  the patriot had seemingly been doing anything they wanted  using run and short pass to expose a front seven that is good at rushing the passer but far worse at putting up with the quick hit that the patriot can accomplish with their small wide receiver and their talented group of running back <BRK>in all  the drive went   yard on   play  but the chief were able to escape  still trailing     <BRK>new england had gotten the ball back quickly thanks to a fairly inept first drive the chief  offense in which kansa city generated minus   yard a a result of a sack of patrick mahomes that came after he had his first two pas attempt of the game fall incomplete  the only positive movement of the drive for the chief came thanks to a   yard run damien williams   which he followed with a   yard loss   and a   yard penalty the patriot  defense <BRK>now mahomes will get a second chance to show what he can do <BRK>it wa clear coming in that this game would be a tough test for the chief  defense  and the unit looked almost helpless on an opening drive the patriot in which new england marched   yard on   play  punching the ball into the end zone on a   yard run sony michel <BRK>the seemingly endless drive chewed up   minute   second of the first quarter and ha kansa city on it heel <BRK>the patriot got off to a quick start on an   yard run michel  and proceeded down the field through a combination of short pass   rob gronkowski had two catch on the drive after having just one all game last week   and run their three headed monster at running back  michel  james white and rex burkhead  <BRK>in all  brady threw for   yard and the running game contributed   <BRK><BRK>
