next step wa   grime said <BRK>the injury did not heal  and grime s tolerance for hydrocodone  percocet  vicodin and other painkiller grew  to feed his addiction  he visited an array of doctor with the x ray from his playing day <BRK>later  he visited pain clinic where  he said  doctor requested only the briefest justification for writing prescription  at a time when many physician accepted a sale pitch from drug company  such a purdue pharma  the maker of several potent painkiller  that their pill were a safe and effective way to treat pain  these pill required more and more cah  though
