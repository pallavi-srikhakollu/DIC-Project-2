 <BRK>  <BRK> by kevin draper and ken belson <BRK> atlanta   ten day after a controversial noncall marred the ending of the n f c  championship game  n f l  commissioner roger goodell finally addressed it publicly  acknowledging that the official had blown the call  <BRK>  it is a play that should be called   he said at his annual state of the league address on wednesday   whenever officiating is part of any kind of discusion postgame  it is never a good outcome for u  we know that  our club know that  our official know that   <BRK> late in the fourth quarter in a tied n f c  championship game on jan     with new orleans deep in los angeles territory  ram cornerback nickell robey coleman hit saint wide receiver tommylee lewis before he could attempt to catch a pas  robey coleman could have been called for pas interference or helmet to helmet contact  but instead wa called for neither  <BRK> the saint went on to kick a field goal but left enough time on the clock for the ram to tie the score and send the game into overtime  where los angeles won  <BRK> the league had refused to comment publicly on the play for more than a week  but saint coach sean payton said shortly after the game that al riveron  the n f l  s director of officiating  had told him official got the call wrong  robey coleman wa later fined for a helmet to helmet hit  <BRK>  we understand the frustration of the fan   goodell said wednesday before detailing the extensive contact the league had with the saint  including their owner  gayle benson  <BRK>  coach payton spoke to al riveron  our head of officiating  immediately after the game   goodell said   al told him that is a play we want to have called  i have spoken to him  troy vincent  the head of football ops  ha spoken to him  i have spoken to mr  benson  the coach ha also talked to the head of the competition committee  rich mckay   <BRK> asked if he had considered ordering the game replayed from the point of the missed call  goodell said   absolutely not   he also noted the league rule book state that the result of game should not be overturned because of routine officiating error  <BRK> goodell said the league s competition committee would consider change to instant replay to address such call  but he added that in the past there had been little appetite to allow replay official to call penalty on play where no flag wa thrown  he also said he did not think adding an eighth official wa a good solution  <BRK>  i don t think adding an official is an answer to all of the issue  and particularly this issue   goodell said  <BRK> goodell s   minute question and answer session wa dominated the play in new orleans  but goodell also wa asked about a number of other hot button topic  including colin kaepernick  the effectiveness of the league s rooney rule in diversifying coaching staff  president trump  the messy inheritance fight over the denver bronco  and league investigation of the player kareem hunt and reuben foster  <BRK> the most pointed question invoked atlanta s pat a a hub of the civil right movement  and how history will judge kaepernick s continued absence from the league  kaepernick  the former san francisco  er quarterback  ha filed a grievance accusing owner of colluding to keep him out of the n f l  because of his social activism  <BRK> goodell said the league office had no role in the personnel decision of individual team   our club are the one that make decision on player that they want to have on their roster   he said  adding   that is something we a the n f l  take pride in   <BRK> he also wa asked if the league s rooney rule  which requires team to interview at least one minority candidate for head coach opening  wa still effective  the rule wa strengthened in december  but the number of minority coach in the league ha dropped precipitously after four black head coach were fired after the season  <BRK> goodell said the league did not view the success or failure of the rooney rule  which wa adopted in    in one year increment  he said the league wa talking with coach about how to provide greater opportunity to minority coach  and announced that a quarterback summit would be held in june at morehouse college  a historically black college in atlanta  to train new coach  <BRK> the commissioner refused to take the bait when asked about president trump  who said two year ago that the n f l  should allow more and harder hit  goodell noted the irony of his being asked about official throwing too many flag at a news conference dominated criticism of a game in which a flag wa not thrown  before saying simply that the n f l  strives for game to be officiated at the  highest level   <BRK> asked about the ongoing fight in denver over the inheritance of the bronco  goodell said that it wa  sad when dispute like this occur   but that he could not say much publicly because the league office could have to adjudicate the dispute  <BRK> finally  goodell said league investigation into foster and hunt were continuing  foster  a linebacker  wa released the  er after being arrested on domestic violence charge for a second time  then wa signed the wahington redskin  charge against foster have been dropped  but goodell said foster still could be punished under the league s peronal conduct policy  <BRK> hunt  a running back  wa released the kansa city chief in november after tmz published video showing him pushing and kicking a woman  he remains unsigned  a new york time investigation revealed that the n f l   despite interviewing hunt earlier in the year  failed to question him about the incident  goodell said there had been a  tremendous amount of progress  made in the investigation in the last   to   day  though he did not detail what that progress entailed  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
