<BRK><BRK>the post truth era ha found it post truth sport <BRK>by frank bruni<BRK>opinion columnist<BRK>i m not really sure why they re bothering with a super bowl this year  sure  a bunch of people will make a boatload of money  ten of million of u will reflexively tune in and we ll find rare common ground over how cheesy the halftime show is  but are we believer anymore  will we really see the winner a the winner   or jut a the charmed survivor of a grossly tarnished process  be it the new england patriot or the los angeles ram  the team will have an aterisk after it name  and that aterisk is a big fat sign of the time  <BRK>i m referring  of course  to the miserable officiating that s arguably the reaon the patriot beat the kansa city chief and the ram beat the new orleans saint  leading to the matchup in this coming sunday s seaon finale game  the ram in particular were blessed the referee  who failed to note and penalize a glaring cae of pa interference in the climactic minute  i needn t describe what happened  footage of it ha been replayed a extensively and analyzed a exhaustively a the zapruder film <BRK>and it ha prompted an intensity of protest  a magnitude of soul searching and a depth of cynicism that go well beyond the crime in question  that s where the feeling about the super bowl and the mood of america converge <BRK> go beyond the headline and behind the curtain with frank bruni s candid reflection on politics  culture  higher education and more every week  sign up for his newsletter   <BRK>we re still reeling from a presidential election that wa colored if not corrupted unfair advantage  undue meddling and disrespected rule  and here we have a super bowl that s colored if not corrupted unfair advantage  undue meddling and disrespected rule  many fan are rejecting it legitimacy   sound familiar  there are conspiracy theory afoot <BRK>american are so down on  and distrustful of  major institution and authority that we re primed to declare their fraudulence  and the national football league and the super bowl are on the receiving end of that  they re not fresh target  not any stretch  but this time we ve lost all sense of perspective  <BRK>the missed pas interference call in the clash between the ram and saint wa certainly egregious  but every football game is a compendium of good and bad break  luck is always a factor and often the deciding one  the saint had home field advantage  and their fan created enough noise to addle and even paralyze the ram on offense  the saint also made error galore  blowing the possibility of a lead too commanding to be erased poor officiating  on a recent episode of his podcast  the sport commentator bill simmons methodically broke down the game en route to this conclusion   i really thought the ram were better   he added that  if that s a neutral field  i think the ram win  <BRK>that the ram did win  with an assist from somnambulistic referee  ha not gone over well in new orleans  the louisiana governor wrote a letter of condemnation to n f l  commissioner roger goodell  the new orleans city council is considering a formal resolution declaring the outcome an  injustice  and demanding that the n f l  thoroughly review it rule  one of louisiana s senator ha called for a congressional hearing on the matter <BRK>several saint ticket holder have filed lawsuit against the n f l   variously claiming that they have endured mental anguish  lost the enjoyment of life and been defrauded the league  a movement in new orleans to boycott the super bowl involves the staging of competing event  vow many bar not to show the game and pledge many other bar to show  instead  the   super bowl  in which the saint beat the indianapolis colt  <BRK>the team s fan  in other word  can choose an alternative reality  again  sound familiar <BRK>outside louisiana  there have been murmur about the fact that four referee in the ram saint contest live in southern california  wa a secret pro ram bias at work  there ha also been angst about the speed of player now  the intricacy of the rule book  the ease of instant replay and what all of that portends   what if this wa the moment that blew all of our commonly held notion about officiating to piece and made u really  truly question whether the game in it current state can really be adequately overseen referee at all   asked conor orr  epically  on sport illutrated s website <BRK>on deadspin com  tom ley went further  writing that football today  requires you to sit on your couch for three hour and spend the whole time questioning if what you saw is really what you saw   the referee  the videotape and the fan have conflicting perception and wind up telling diverging story   not just about the pas interference bungle but about a roughing the paser penalty on a chief player who  to my eye  did nothing more than fail to blow tom brady an air kiss at the end of the play  that decision  too  wa possibly game changing  graduating brady to a super bowl in which he may not belong <BRK>football ha never been entirely fair  any more than life is  in the past  the patriot were caught spying on other team  the saint were punished for deliberately trying to injure opposing team  player  critic gasped and the band played on  maybe the same will happen this time <BRK>or maybe the post truth era ha found it post truth
