millionaire  wa charged with two first degree misdemeanor count of soliciting a prostitute at a massage parlor in the town of jupiter  a   minute drive away  there  the police said they twice caught mr  kraft     on video paying for sex with a woman <BRK>mr  kraft ha denied the charge  but even the suggestion that a prominent sportsman  businessman and philanthropist might have sought company in a seedy massage parlor up the road ha many resident wondering why a man worth an estimated      billion would risk his reputation so recklessly on a    an hour massage <BRK> you just would never hear of anything a sleazy a that in palm beach   said ronald kessler  who   year ago wrote a book about the debauchery of the island s wealthiest scion  most of it kept discreetly within the confines of billionaire row <BRK>back then  news of call girl being arrested in palm beach wa not unheard of  he said  in the age of tmz  cellphone camera and the internet  it seems  resident have generally become more careful  and yet some still throw caution to the wind <BRK> you can t say   what happens in florida stay in florida   because it never doe   said carl hiaasen  who writes extensively about the foible of floridian  but said he wa surprised to see the news of mr  kraft s arrest warrant   the family is very philanthropic  and this time of year is the season   he said   you don t expect to

private room set up  and nobody will know who s there  that s the way it is  <BRK>for the most part  the wealthy northeast baron who own waterfront mansion and luxury condo in this storied part of florida come to avoid the cold weather and high tax back home  though he life in boston and travel widely  mr  kraft  in his signature nike sneaker and shock of gray hair  ha become a regular  popping into charity event to write big check and dining at mar a lago  the exclusive club owned his friend president trump <BRK> read   the monster are the men   inside a thriving sex trafficking trade in florida <BRK>two week ago  mr  kraft wa spotted at a sound check for another of his friend  the rock star jon bon jovi  who wa performing in a multimillion dollar fund raiser for the everglades foundation at the breaker  a gilded age palm beach resort where mr  kraft stay in a condo when he is in town <BRK>the resort s guest have included a who s who of american royalty  the hotel date back

and greg norman  some of them have occaionally been spotted in a movie theater across the street from orchid of aia  the masage spa where the police say they videotaped mr  kraft <BRK>one of the attraction for millionaire to sunny florida ha nothing to do with the beach  there is no state income tax  and the state s homestead exemption cap property tax increase  that ha proved to be a big lure in recent year for those who have made fortune in finance  with money to burn  they have bought property and built mansion on street nicknamed banker row <BRK> they come here for the sun  fun and lower tax   said joel cohen  who owned an art and photo gallery in palm beach for year   it s one big rich people s family  <BRK>yet that ha had the effect of pushing down the declining population  which is now about     resident  the ultra wealthy  said laurel baker  the chief executive of the palm beach chamber of commerce  often knock down apartment and multifamily building and replace them with single family home  often very large one  this ha driven up property price further  making palm beach even more exclusive <BRK> one of the downside is a starter home is three  four or five million dollar  which doe not necessarily draw the boy scout and girl scout of america   she said <BRK>mr  kraft pleaded not guilty on thursday and requested a non jury trial  according to a court filing his defense lawyer  jack a  goldberger <BRK>he wa not the only wealthy businessman charged in the massage parlor case  john haven  former president and chief operating officer of citigroup  and

and mr  haven ha not commented on them  <BRK> they come from all walk of life  there s rich and poor  there s young and old   said dave aronberg  the state attorney in palm beach county who pressed charge on monday  mr  kraft  he added  would not receive any advantage   i can assure you that our office treat everyone the same  whether you have a lot of money or are indigent  <BRK>much is still not known about the woman at the orchid of aia masage parlor  which police say wa part of a human trafficking ring  there is no suggestion that mr  kraft or the other   people arrested knew that the woman were working there against their will  a police contend <BRK>a for why wealthy businessmen with presumably plenty of option might frequent a cheap strip mall masage joint  that s a question many local have not been able to answer <BRK> that is what just absolutely shock me about this whole thing   mr  ausem said   for robert kraft to go in a place like this  for   or   buck and give her a    tip   it just blow me away   i can put a hat on  i won t be recognized   i mean  it s just so stupid  <BRK>for some veteran palm beach observer  the accusation of mr  kraft s involvement in the tawdry business of paid sex is another example of how wealth can breed a sense of entitlement that blind <BRK> when you have that much money  you believe you are untouchable   said mari kirschbaum  the president of bbp investigation  a private investigator in neighboring broward county   the billionaire are arrogant  they think they are bulletproof  <BRK>alain delaquérière contributed research
