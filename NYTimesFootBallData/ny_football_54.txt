<BRK><BRK>the speed and power of the ram  wrecking ball lineman show that size isn t everything in the n f l <BRK>by ben shpigel<BRK>atlanta   the ram selected defensive tackle aaron donald with their second first round pick in    no    over all  which mean that   other team  after assembling draft board and consulting scout and analyzing a trilogy s worth of film of his demolishing offensive linemen  decided against taking a player whose dominance ha since redefined his position <BRK> i think   said mike waufle  the ram  defensive line coach at the time   people were scared of his size  <BRK>donald is   foot   and  coming out of the university of pittsburgh  wa listed at   pound  that is enormous in human term  but smallish for a defensive tackle  whose function in a     defense is to blot out the sun <BRK>not everyone with the ram coveted donald  but waufle wa undeterred  he had long prized speed over size  and from the start  he viewed donald a an outlier  grading him a the best prospect he had seen since    his first seaon coaching in the n f l  donald generated so much power that he reminded waufle of the russian boxer ivan drago in  rocky iv   who punched a computerized meter with such force that drago s manager remarked   whatever he hit  he destroys  <BRK>in his first seaon  donald wa selected a the top defensive rookie  lat seaon  he wa defensive player of the year  after registering     sack this seaon  the most ever a defensive tackle  donald will almost certainly repeat <BRK>the ram  ascent to a super bowl berth against the new england patriot on sunday from     buffoonery in   reflects a certain harmonic convergence   the confluence of foresight  audacity and good fortune  with donald embodying it all <BRK>coach sean mcvay  a brilliant communicator whose football acumen pushed the ram to the forefront of the league s offensive frenzy  ha already spawned a coaching tree  and the team ha traded precious draft pick to acquire volatile personality who have meshed in a cohesive locker room  but before all that  the ram had the conviction to draft donald  in    he wa an excellent defender  in    he is the avatar for defensive disruption <BRK>with n f l  team eschewing downfield pass for underneath route  and patriot quarterback tom brady averaging a mere     second per postseason throw in the pocket  according to pro football focus  interior pressure is ever more critical  and no one plow into the backfield faster than donald  a player new england coach bill belichick called  pretty much unblockable  <BRK> if he keep this up   the hall of fame defensive tackle john randle said   he can change the game almost like a lawrence taylor  <BRK>randle transformed the position  too  playing at     and   pound  but in a different era  when team prioritized space choking interior tackle to stop the run and tended to harass quarterback from the outside  of the   instance in which a player had at least     sack in a season since the statistic wa first tracked in      came from defender who didn t play tackle  according to the elia sport bureau <BRK>randle never quite reached that total  topping out at      but contemporary like la roi glover and warren sapp did  and randle viewed them  and himself  a misfit  fueled the perception that they weren t fat enough to play linebacker  big enough to play offensive line or nimble enough to play running back <BRK>across   seaon with minnesota and seattle  randle amased the most sack a defensive tackle in n f l  history         destroying quarterback and game plan much a donald doe now  just with le time to get to the quarterback  donald had a league leading   pressure  according to pro football focus  the next closest player  fletcher cox of philadelphia  had   <BRK> when you get that interior pressure  they can t run the sweep  the center can t pull   randle said   when you re in the inside  you may not get there  but you re in the quarterback s face  and he can t see because the pressure s there  he see you  and he s more conscious of you  you re right there in front of him  <BRK>when watching donald  randle notice how his foot  hand and eye work in concert  with a first step so quick that it can be mistaken for reflex  donald s arm allow him to get leverage on taller linemen   plural  considering the double team he face   beneath their pad  taking away their strength <BRK> some guy at that position are top heavy with skinny little leg  or are big down below but have nothing up top   dewayne brown  who ha helped train donald since   in their native pittsburgh  said in a telephone interview   he s built like a block  totally proportional  <BRK>a secret  donald may be listed at   pound  but  he said tuesday  he ha been playing at    maybe     the ram  other defensive tackle  ndamukong suh  is listed at     and   pound   over text  waufle call donald a male model and tell him he s pretty  donald s father  archie  asked brown to remind his son that he s not a bodybuilder  in a photo he posted to his instagram story monday  a shirtless donald is shown flexing  muscle bulging  his abdominal muscle clearly defined  celery ha more fat than he doe <BRK> he s got  like  an eight pack   ram defensive tackle michael brockers said <BRK>in the off seaon  brown help donald refine his speed and agility with   minute workout laden with core exercise and resistance training  like the drill he performs wearing lateral resistor on his ankle  a someone drop a tennis ball eight yard away  donald must sprint to grab it before it bounce a second time  go on  try it <BRK>to increase his strength  donald work with dave andrew  the strength and conditioning coach at pitt  who called him  a genetic mutant  and  a ball of dynamite   andrew challenge him with exercise in which he provides donald with resistance throughout the entire movement to isolate a particular muscle group <BRK> it s no different than when they re in hand to hand combat on the field  and they re manually trying to resist what he s doing   andrew said   most likely  it take two  maybe three guy  to slow aaron down  you can imagine what it s like in the weight room  like  good luck  i walk out in a full sweat  <BRK>donald ha long been strong and thick  a an adolescent  he would wake before dawn to lift weight with his father  but donald wa  real chunky   brown said  when he first encountered him a a junior at penn hill high school <BRK>that season  greg gattuso  then the defensive line coach at pitt  attended a penn hill game to scout one of donald s teammate  he had heard of donald but had never watched him  before leaving  gattuso offered him a scholarship <BRK>with each successive season at pitt  donald had more tackle for loss  his senior year  nearly half of his   tackle         came behind the line of scrimmage  at the n f l  scouting combine  donald ran the   yard dash in     second  faster that year than raider quarterback derek carr           patriot linebacker kyle van noy          and cowboy defensive end demarcus lawrence           his   yard split  which gauge short area quickness  wa a solid     second <BRK>from afar  waufle yearned  a defensive line coach for the giant  he replaced interior linemen with speedier end to overwhelm brady and unbeaten new england in super bowl xlii  he said he studied more game tape of randle than randle himself <BRK>waufle wanted a randle of his own <BRK>on draft night  waufle wa working on a project in his office when  around the eighth pick or so  he glanced at the television and noticed donald wa still available  he cycled through scenario in his head <BRK>he thought detroit  picking  th  would grab him  he thought the giant  picking  th  would  too  when the ram were on the clock  he sneaked into the draft room  hoping for good news  when he got it  he nearly yelped inside <BRK>the next time he saw donald  told him something he had never said to another player  don t listen to anything i say <BRK> we ll get you lined up  and you just go  man   you just go   waufle said  relaying their conversation   and he did  he tore the league up  <BRK>waufle left the ram when mcvay wa hired  after the   season  but his successor  bill johnson  marvel daily at donald <BRK> what make him different is no different than what make a racehorse so great   johnson said   they re just sort of made to be  i guess  i don t know  if i knew  i d be cloning it  <BRK>donald s trajectory might have made team reassess their evaluation of him  it might have even made them more likely to consider undersized defensive tackle in the future   imitation and flattery  and all that  <BRK>but there is only one aaron donald  and to the dismay of every other team  but most of all new england this week  he play for the ram <BRK>ben shpigel is a sport reporter and ha covered the n f l  and the new york jet since    he ha also covered the new york yankee and  before that
