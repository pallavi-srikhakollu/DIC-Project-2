ha taken direct aim at the team itself  <BRK> organizer of the asian cup said on thursday that they would respond to an official complaint lodged emirate soccer official  who charged that two member of the qatari team were ineligible to play in the region s biggest tournament  <BRK> the player   almoez ali  a sudan born striker  and bassam al rawi  a defender born in iraq   are fixture in qatar s lineup  ali is the tournament s top scorer  with eight goal in six game  and al rawi scored the goal that sent qatar to the quarterfinal  <BRK> the complaint is the latest salvo in a bitter dispute between the gulf neighbor that go far beyond soccer  the emirate is part of a two year old  saudi led blockade of qatar  driven a belief that it neighbor is financing terrorism and growing too close to iran  saudi arabia s biggest regional rival  qatar ha denied playing any role in supporting terrorist group  <BRK> the dispute ha already manifested itself in way small and large in the tournament  which now represents qatar s biggest success on the soccer field  <BRK> one consequence of the dispute is that there are no direct flight from doha to abu dhabi  so qatar s team had to fly through oman on it way to the event  and qatari fan   unable to travel to the emirate without permission   are largely absent at the team s match  <BRK> but qatar  which ha never qualified for a world cup but will host the event in    ha been the surprise of the field  it will play japan in the final on friday  <BRK> but even a qatar marched through the field  rumor   fueled a close reading of fifa nationality rule   swirled about the eligibility of ali and al rawi  <BRK> the silence of qatari official on the issue ha only led to more rumor  a spokesman for the team ha not responded to repeated request for comment  while fifa  the global governing body for soccer  ha said the matter fall under the jurisdiction of the tournament organizer  the asian football confederation  <BRK> the a f c  had said that it would intervene only an official complaint were filed  that complaint arrived in the aftermath of the emirate  humiliating defeat in front of it own fan in abu dhabi on tuesday  <BRK>  the asian football confederation ha a received a protest from the united arab emirate f a  regarding the eligibility of two qatar player   the a f c  said in a statement on thursday   this protest will now be reviewed in line with the a f c  regulation   <BRK> the a f c  declined to identify the possible punishment for qatar  team that have previously fielded ineligible player have forfeited game  but the situation ha never come up at the final stage of a major international event  <BRK> under soccer s regulation  player are only eligible for a national team outside of their country of birth if they have lived there for five continuous year after turning    al rawi is   and ali is    the rule make an exception that permit player to represent a country if a parent or grandparent wa born there  many country  including the united state  regularly take advantage of the exception  <BRK> qatar ha been trawling the world for talent for year in preparation for the   world cup  embarking on perhaps the most extensive talent identification program in history  one that involved the creation of training program for youngster from africa and an academy for the best prospect in doha  <BRK> official in the country have said in the past that the program doe not require those scouted to pick qatar over their birth country  though born in sudan  ali ha lived in qatar since he wa a child  al rawi s father once represented iraq internationally  <BRK> still  qatar s squad at the youth and senior level have included several expatriate player  and the eligibility wa not questioned when ali and al rawi represented the country at previous tournament sanctioned fifa and the a f c  <BRK> it wa not clear why the emirate  or any of qatar s other opponent   including saudi arabia  which lost to qatar        did not raise the issue until after the semifinal  <BRK> the victory over the saudi and the emirate were greeted scene of jubilation in qatar  where fan draped in the country s flag took to the street of doha to celebrate the victory  <BRK> for the host  the defeat wa particularly painful given the effort it had made to create a partisan atmosphere inside abu dhabi s zayed sport city stadium  local organizer distributed thousand of free ticket to what it described a  loyal  fan before the game  <BRK> for the a f c   the issue also raise another political issue  it president  sheikh salman bin ibrahim al khalifa of bahrain  is being challenged for his post candidate from the emirate and qatar  <BRK> the organization ha opened a separate investigation over the shoe  and bottle throwing incident that marred the semifinal  that case could lead to sanction  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
