<BRK><BRK>on baseball<BRK>by tyler kepner<BRK>the oakland athletics were overjoyed to choose kyler murray with the ninth pick in the baseball draft last june <BRK> we just don t see athlete like this on the baseball field very often   their scouting director  eric kubota  said then  praising murray s instinct despite his relative lack of baseball experience   he s just a tremendous athlete  which can translate to the baseball field in a lot of way  he ha a chance to really be dominant on both the offensive end and from a defensive standpoint  <BRK>kubota said the risk of murray s playing quarterback at the university of oklahoma wa worth taking <BRK> frankly  we re kind of excited to be an oklahoma fan for   game   he said <BRK>everybody know what happened next  those   regular season game led to the conference title game and the orange bowl  and the end  murray had more than     all purpose yard    overall touchdown  a heisman trophy   and a new career path <BRK>murray announced via twitter on monday that he wa  firmly and fully committing my life and time to becoming an n f l  quarterback   his statement made no mention of baseball  the a s  or the      million deal he reached with them last june  with the promise to play only baseball after the   college football season <BRK>the a s were the first team to hold formal workout for pitcher and catcher on monday   they started earlier than other team  to prepare for a season opening series in japan with the seattle mariner on march   and     and murray will not be joining them  he will return      million of his      million signing bonus  according to espn  and will not collect the remaining      million that he wa due to be paid next month <BRK>he had been assigned a locker in the clubhouse  and on monday morning  oakland official had expressed hope that murray would soon slip into his no    jersey <BRK>bob melvin  the a s manager  said he wa  cautiously optimistic  that murray would choose baseball  according to the san francisco chronicle  yet  realistically  those hope had been dimming since murray declared for the n f l  draft on jan     the a s retain his right should murray ever reconsider  but they will get no compensation pick for his defection  they gambled and lost   but baseball lost even bigger <BRK>murray teased the possibility of playing both sport in a photo he posted to twitter in november  re enacting a ubiquitous bo jackson photo from the  s posing shirtless with football pad on his shoulder and a baseball bat behind his back <BRK>but jackson  of course  did not play quarterback  an all consuming position that leaf no room for distraction  to maximize his appeal to team   and his potential for success   murray chose football exclusively  which most likely will bring him more money  at least at first  and definitely offer a quicker path to glory <BRK>the sport are fundamentally different in their development process  of course  almost every baeball player log year in the minor  riding bus to remote outpost for a punishing daily test that is at leat a much mental a physical  a first round n f l  quarterback is typically hailed a the instant savior of his franchise <BRK>murray s predecessor a heisman trophy winner and oklahoma quarterback  baker mayfield  needed one month to establish himself a the starter for the cleveland brown  he sat the first two week  came off the bench in week   and wa starting for good sept     what s more appealing to a   year old athlete  the mayfield plan  or a summer trying to hit slider for an a s affiliate in beloit  wi   or stockton  calif  <BRK>murray s uncle  calvin murray  offer an example of the uncertainty of life a a baeball prospect  the san francisco giant chose calvin murray with the seventh overall pick in the   draft  he played more than     professional game  but fewer than   in the major  the player taken one pick before murray did just a bit better  his name wa derek jeter <BRK>we ll probably never know what kyler murray could have been a a baeball player  he could always try the sport again if football fizzle  a tim tebow is doing with the mets  but baeball  a an institution  doe not give itself the best chance to attract an athlete like murray  whose bonus potential wa limited the strict draft slotting system instituted in   <BRK>the draft system ha always incentivized losing  to some extent   in   and    the washington national plotted a new course taking stephen strasburg and bryce harper first over all in consecutive draft  but awarding a fixed amount of bonus money to team   with the worst team getting far the largest allowance   the new rule have greatly encouraged protracted rebuilding <BRK>the houston astros understood this better than most  and became a perennial power using the system to their advantage  they have spawned so many imitator that a record eight team tallied   loss last season <BRK>the player  union ha been dismayed this trend  which ha lessened demand   and therefore salary   for veteran free agent  murray s case show another regrettable consequence  perhaps if the a s had been able to offer more money to murray last june  they could have kept him off the football field entirely <BRK>instead  their      million bought only a half meaure  allowing murray one final fling with an old flame  a it turn out  he fell truly  madly  deeply back in love  the a s get their ring back  but baeball is left at the altar <BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK>
