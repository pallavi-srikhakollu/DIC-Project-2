<BRK><BRK>the league didn t actually try to steal nashville s gorgeous cherry tree  but it sure felt that way <BRK>by margaret renkl<BRK>contributing opinion writer<BRK>nashville   last saturday morning  all across the city  nashville resident woke up to news that seemed almost orwellian   or if not orwellian  then at least onionian  city official had decided to cut down   mature cherry tree in full bloom <BRK>on le than   hour  notice <BRK>because the national football league asked them to <BRK>the cherry tree in question line downtown s first avenue north  which run along the cumberland river and front riverfront park  site of the city s grandest celebration  later this month that park will be where the n f l  hold it annual draft  an event that seems to require a giant stage the like of which nahville   and possibly all of tennessee  maybe even the whole country   ha never seen  nahville  otherwise known a music city  is pretty well set with stage  but apparently none of them is sufficiently grand to suit the n f l  better to chop down a bunch of living tree and build an even grander stage  and all for a three day event that may be moved indoors anyway  perhaps you ve heard of april shower <BRK>the irony here abound  just lat october  nahville s mayor  david briley  announced a major initiative to plant     tree     an effort to replace the roughly     tree the city is losing each year to it explosive growth  but the tree in question here hadn t been lost at all  they are mature yoshino cherry tree  the same tree that bloom so extravagantly along the mall in wahington during the national cherry blossom festival  and nahville s own cherry blossom festival  which national geographic rank a one of the best in the country  is set for april    le than two week after news broke that   of the   tree on first avenue north would be destroyed <BRK>the optic of this plan to kill the cherry tree are bad  let s kill some living tree so that we can put up a temporary stage to promote an organization that profit from a sport widely understood to cause grievous  long term damage to the brain of it player  those airy pink blossom with petal that float on the wind and fall on our shoulder like a benediction  let s cut them down for the sake of a blood sport <BRK>nashvillians erupted with fury  conservation group like the nashville tree foundation and the nashville tree conservation corp mobilized their follower  who sent up a great alarm that quickly rippled across facebook and twitter and from there to local  and then national  news outlet <BRK>a change org petition posted at   o clock on saturday morning racked up thousand of signature   more than     sunday afternoon   and city official were scrambling to respond  at first announcing that the   tree would be dug up and relocated in the city  and then reconfiguring the plan itself so that only   tree would be moved  leaving all the tree on first avenue itself in place   in our own brand promise  we talk about protecting the authenticity of the city   butch spryidon  the chief executive of the nashville convention and visitor corp   said in a public apology on sunday   i think it s a balance  i think it s a good reminder of that balance  lesson learned  hard lesson learned  <BRK>well  no  a lesson truly learned would have meant moving that stage  mature tree can with great effort be transplanted successfully under ideal circumstance  but these are not ideal circumstance  their root lie under a public walkway paved with brick  a location that make it difficult to remove enough of the root structure for successful relocation  and transplanting a tree once it ha already begun to bud out in spring  just before the stress of summer heat  make the challenge to it survival even greater  moving these tree  in other word  is just a more expensive way to kill them <BRK>we have bigger problem in this city than the loss of   cherry tree  our school board is completely dysfunctional  our state legislature  in thrall to the koch network  is energetically working to undercut every progressive law nashville pass  a recent investigation the tennessean  the city s daily newspaper  revealed that tennessee ha surreptitiously cut     child from state health insurance roll during the past two year  more than     of those kid live in nashville <BRK>and it s not a though the cherry tree are stately oak that go back hundred of year  they re ornamental  not shade tree  and their ideal habitat is japan  not tennessee  the benefit of a robust tree canopy in the urban core are well known now  tree mitigate the effect of greenhouse gases  cool city sidewalk and street  reduce energy cost for building  absorb and filter storm water  the cherry tree at riverfront park provide those benefit  no doubt  but there are many native tree that could do that work much better  equally beautifully  and with a longer life expectancy <BRK>when the n f l  draft wa held in dallas last year  it inspired some    million in visitor spending  according to the nashville convention and visitor corp   so it s easy to see why city official gave the cherry tree so little thought  these people are not villain  they aren t sitting in a bunker plotting to steal nashville s tree  they aren t thinking about tree at all  they re thinking about landing a deal to bring a bunch of spending money to downtown nashville  a city with a cash flow problem so troubling that last year it reneged on a promised cost of living increase for city employee   mayor briley s proposed budget for the     fiscal year restores those raise  <BRK>but sometimes good intention can be a harmful a villainy  there is no  authenticity to the city  left in downtown nahville anymore  lower broad is a neon wateland of rooftop bar and pedal tavern and motorized scooter and horse drawn carriage in the shape of cinderella s pumpkin and a terrible new rolling atrocity called the music city party tub  such tourist attraction are to the real nahville what la vega is to the pristine sand of the mojave desert before white people found it <BRK>nashvillians are not alone in finding their own city unrecognizable  in getting lost on once familiar route because longtime landmark are gone and monstrous new building have risen  seemingly overnight  where they once stood  all across the country  in growing city like austin and burlington and charlotte and denver  people are looking around and wondering if they still belong in the place where they actually live  we all have the same secret fear  what if this town we love so much is just the next atlanta <BRK>we are tired of not being able to walk on our own sidewalk because a construction site is sprawled directly across it  we are tired of the outside developer and rental property  investor  who bid up the price of our house so high that local family can t afford them  we are tired of watching our elected leader giving all manner of incentive to outside corporation but offering no helping hand at all to the small business that are trying so hard to survive in the  new nashville  <BRK>most of all we are sick  sick  sick of sitting in traffic  year ago  people around here put funny bumper sticker on their car that read   welcome to nashville  now y all go home   we aren t laughing anymore  we re sitting in our motionless car and scrolling through twitter  learning that when the n f l  said   just cut down these gorgeous cherry tree and we ll bring our draft to nashville   the people who run this city smiled and said   sure  no problem  how many tree do you need  <BRK><BRK>the time is committed to publishing a diversity of letter to the editor  we d like to hear what you think about this or any of our article  here are
