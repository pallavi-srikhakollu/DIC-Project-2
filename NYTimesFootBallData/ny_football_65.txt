<BRK><BRK>by victor mather<BRK>some city are not all in on the super bowl this year  and those place include the city where the game is being held and the city that one of the two team call home <BRK>but which city is offering up the most indifference to sunday s matchup between the new england patriot and the los angeles ram  there are four chief candidate <BRK>st  louis wa the home of the ram for   year  but more recently not the home of the ram for the past three year  fan there are still angry their team left after the   season  few are excited about the super bowl  and fewer still expect to root for the ram <BRK> since the ram left  i ve watched little to no football  if it s on a television  i look elsewhere   the former ram fan dan buffa wrote in an essay on ksdk titled   why i won t be watching the super bowl  <BRK>fan are especially bitter about the way the ram  owner  stan kroenke  a missouri native  left town with the team  with a flurry of dismissive comment about the city s economic prospect  in an objection to a plan to finance a new stadium in st  louis  he wrote   any n f l  club that sign on to this proposal in st  louis will be well on the road to financial ruin  and the league will be harmed  <BRK>and to many onetime ram fan  it seemed a if the team didn t turn on the real effort to win until the move  sure  the st  louis ram went to two super bowl  winning in the   seaon  but after   straight seaons at    and below in st  louis  the team waited till it got to los angeles to fire coach jeff fisher and bring in the young genius sean mcvay  who brought immediate success <BRK>st  louis fan don t feel much good will toward the patriot  either  since that wa the team that beat st  louis in it lat trip to the super bowl  in    that ram team  known a the greatest show on turf  wa a   point favorite  and many former ram player  including marshall faulk  have contended that new england cheated filming the ram  walk through the day before the game <BRK> is there anywhere in the rule book that both team can lose   a fan named james heredia asked cbs <BRK>falling a game short of the super bowl is painful  when a major reason is a blown call  it sting even more  the agony of losing the n f c  conference championship game to the ram ha led many saint fan to turn their back on the big game <BRK>don t believe u  believe the governor <BRK> i ll be honest   i don t know anyone who ha interest in watching the game in our entire state   gov  john bel edward of louisiana told usa today  he added the opinion that  it wa the worst call in the history of the n f l  <BRK>it wa only two week ago  but to refresh your memory  late in a tied game  with the saint driving  ram cornerback nickell robey coleman slammed into new orleans receiver tommylee lewis  it looked like pas interference or a helmet to helmet hit  or both  but there wa no call  the pas wa ruled incomplete  and the saint had to settle for a field goal  the ram had time to match that field goal  then won in overtime <BRK>on wednesday  roger goodell  the commissioner of the n f l   acknowledged the officiating crew messed up on the play <BRK>the loss  combined with the recent trade request of the pelican star anthony davis  led jeff duncan of the time picayune to write   with the notable exception of the fall of   when hurricane katrina devastated the city  i can t think of a worse period in our city s sport history  <BRK>eater new orleans offered a list of    place to avoid super bowl liii   bar and restaurant that promise not to show the game on any of their television  in some case  they will instead show a replay of the saint  championship from nine year ago <BRK>nola com ha   reason not to watch the super bowl  but  could come up with    <BRK>there s enough disdain in new orleans that fan are using word like  boycott  and saying they hope they can help hold the super bowl rating down to a record low  but even mass participation is unlikely to make a decisive impact  the new orleans area ha a population of a little over a million  and the super bowl regularly draw more than   million <BRK>o k   it s overstating it a little to say los angeles isn t excited about going to the super bowl  after all  thousand of fan waited in long line this week for a pregame rally <BRK>but while other city virtually stop when their team make the big game  los angeles ha reacted with a comparative shrug <BRK>after only three season back in town  the ram haven t sunk into the city s bone the way  say  the packer and the steelers have in their football mad hometown <BRK>and  hey  lebron james just came back to the lakers after missing five week with an injury <BRK>the los angeles area  home to roughly   million people  ha   major professional sport team and prominent college program  many resident came from somewhere else  and brought their allegiance  perhaps even to the patriot  with them <BRK>some fan chose other team during the two decade the n f l  wa absent from los angeles  a philip nowlen told the new york time s california today newsletter   the year without a team led me to fan commitment to the  er and the pat  maybe after time pases   maybe  <BRK>while the ram drew a robust     fan a game this season  playing in the cavernous coliseum meant they were  at   percent of capacity   st of the   team in the n f l <BRK>ram defensive tackle aaron donald got some attention this week proclaiming that l a  is  a football town now   but his avowal is le interesting than the fact that he wa asked about it at all  no one asked tom brady if boston planned to follow this year s super bowl <BRK>it hasn t even been two year since the atlanta falcon blew a     lead over the patriot and transformed a third quarter super bowl score into a lasting slur <BRK>so perhaps atlanta can be forgiven if it is greeting anything about any super bowl   especially a patriot involved super bowl   with only so much good cheer <BRK>yes  downtown and hartsfield jackson atlanta international airport are glimmering under a global spotlight  and the city  rightly proud of it hospitality tradition  is eager to show it can be the flawless host of a super bowl it worked so hard to earn  mercedes benz stadium  just two season old and already a crown jewel of southern sport  will be on display for all to see <BRK> everything i ve been getting so far is superpositive   said jessie tuggle  the beloved linebacker who played his entire professional career for the falcon and retired after the   season   i think people like being around people  and there are so many people around  they just love the n f l  experience  <BRK>and yet  cue a new round of gripe over traffic  trigger even more critique of the falcon  middling performance of late  and wonder how so many super bowl event seem so out of reach for so many football fan  stir the complaint over the halftime show  and how and why maroon   landed the biggest gig in a city with one of the country s richest music scene <BRK>it is even a moment when atlanta s prized export  coca cola  is a target for trolling pepsi  a major n f l  sponsor that ha made no secret of it pleasure over a big week in one particular city    look who s in town for super bowl liii   read one pepsi advertisement outside a coke sponsored shrine to coke  <BRK>but even with all of that   the pepsi flowing  the traffic slowing  the falcon sputtering  maroon   just being maroon     hey  at least the saint aren t playing  alan blinder<BRK>jill cowan contributed reporting <BRK><BRK>opinionfrank
