<BRK><BRK>charger    raven  <BRK>by bill pennington<BRK>baltimore   the baltimore raven  startling charge into the playoff wa spurred something perhaps even more surprising  a radical  run first style of offense led the rookie quarterback lamar jackson <BRK>baltimore s unconventional style of attack in the midst of a pas happy n f l  era rescued the raven  who won six of their final seven regular season game  and the most impressive victory in that stretch wa a   point romp over the charger in los angeles in week   <BRK>in the end  however  the defeat of the charger wa the raven  undoing in their rematch here sunday in an a f c  wild card playoff game <BRK>in the week leading up to sunday s contest  the charger dissected the videotape of the raven  dec    triumph in los angeles until every play and  more important  the alignment before every play were committed to memory  the charger  defensive coach schooled the player on every raven tendency and tried a daring lineup that included seven defensive back instead of the usual four or five <BRK>the study and the strategy worked  until a late rally in the final minute  baltimore s new look offense had just   point and three first down  jackson wa challenged and confounded into a dreadful performance a los angeles built a commanding lead and held on to upset the raven      <BRK> we had better read on their formation  and we saw thing coming   charger defensive end joey bosa said in the winning locker room   it really wa kind of a blessing to have played them and seen them just a few week ago  <BRK>the charger  defensive approach forced jackson into three fumble   one of which he lost   and an interception  he wa sacked seven time <BRK> you could see we were frustrating them   los angeles cornerback casey hayward jr  said   they were confused  what had been working for them wa not working  <BRK>or  a charger coach anthony lynn said when aked if the raven had appeared flustered   if you re used to running the ball for   yard and you get only    yeah  you get flustered  <BRK>los angeles  which ha won it last seven road game  will travel to new england to face the patriot in a divisional round game sunday at   p m <BRK>for the charger  the rare alignment of seven defensive back  which replaced bulky linebacker with smaller  fleet defender  wa a risk  but it wa intended to thwart jackson s advanced rushing skill <BRK> lamar is so fast  we wanted our fastest guy defending him  even if it meant smaller guy   lynn said   we didn t know if it would work  but we wanted to take a look at it <BRK> we were definitely ready to move onto a different defensive grouping if it didn t work  but it did  <BRK>indeed  it wa effective immediately and set the tone for the game  on the first play from scrimmage  jackson kept the football and tried to dash around right end  he wa tackled for a   yard loss safety derwin james <BRK>recalling the play  lynn smiled broadly <BRK> the first time we played them  we played their game   he said   today  we played our game  <BRK>for the raven  the loss brought a sudden end to a seaon marked dratic change  the longtime raven quarterback joe flacco wa overtaken jackson  who remains the franchise s top quarterback moving forward  john harbaugh  whose job a baltimore s head coach had seemed in jeopardy until the late surge the raven  still may not remain <BRK>flacco did not comment on his future sunday  although he insisted that he did not think he should have replaced jackson a the raven fell behind los angeles   point  harbaugh also declined to discus his own future in detail <BRK> no one can say what tomorrow is going to bring   harbaugh said   we ll see  i have every expectation to be here a long a they want me here  <BRK>the victory wa also a subtle but authoritative accomplishment the veteran charger quarterback philip river  who wa appearing in his  th postseason game  river  who completed   of   pass  coolly and carefully led the los angeles offense on six scoring drive against the n f l  s top ranked defense <BRK>river did not throw an interception and wa sacked just once  and while the charger lost one fumble  they were otherwise judicious with the football and exhibited the kind of ball control offense that had been baltimore s bread and butter in it charge to the playoff <BRK>advancing cautiously for most of the game  los angeles kicked four field goal to take a     halftime lead  in the third quarter  a charger turnover and a blocked punt the raven gave baltimore a brief surge of momentum  but the raven could turn the miscue into only   point when a fumble recovery c  j  mosley led to a   yard justin tucker field goal  after the raven  buck allen partially blocked a punt and gave baltimore good field position  the possession led only to a   yard field goal attempt that tucker missed <BRK>on the ensuing charger possession  a   yard pas from river to mike williams  followed a   yard run melvin gordon  set up a third down from the raven    yard line  gordon wa tripped and fell just before the goal line  the play wa ruled a touchdown until it wa overturned video replay <BRK>on the subsequent fourth down play  gordon bulled into the end zone  the charger completed a   point conversion to extend their lead to     <BRK>at this point  fan at m t bank stadium began chanting flacco s name  jackson remained in the game  but his presence elicited a chorus of boo from the crowd  that displeasure intensified when jackson wa twice sacked on a three and out series <BRK>but on the next series  jackson awakened and tossed a   yard touchdown pas to michael crabtree with   minute   second remaining in the fourth quarter  on the raven  next possession  jackson connected with crabtree again  throwing a   yard touchdown pas that cut the charger  lead to     with     left <BRK>the raven did get the football for a final series  but their comeback ended when jackson wa stripped of the football a he wa preparing to pas  the fumble wa recovered the charger  melvin ingram  who dominated the raven  offensive line throughout sunday s game  ingram had seven tackle and two sack <BRK> this wa and wa not a typical game for u   river said afterward   becaue we ve had all kind of victory   ugly one  pretty one  good game offensively and good game defensively  that s jut u  but mostly  i think we re a pretty good team  <BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK>
