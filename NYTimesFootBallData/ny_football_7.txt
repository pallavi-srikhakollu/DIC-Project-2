<BRK><BRK>by tariq panja<BRK>over the past four year  some of the most damning secret of the professional soccer industry have been exposed a deluge of leak that have shined an unflattering light on some of the sport s most popular club  player and coach <BRK>last week the man behind the leak  a   year old portuguese citizen named rui pinto  wa arrested in budapest  hungary  he face extradition to his home country on the charge  which include an extortion attempt in   on a secretive investment fund that had bet million of dollar in the player transfer market <BRK>for the moment  though  pinto s fate depends on a far narrower matter  whether his team of lawyer can successfully argue that he is a whistle blower under hungarian law   a defendant whose action to expose malpractice and  potentially  a raft of financial and other crime in soccer outweigh any offense he might have committed <BRK>in the view of the portuguese authority  pinto is guilty of extortion and violation of secrecy in relation to his contact with the investment fund  doyen sport  they and doyen have accused him of threatening to publish internal company document   revealing transfer fee and secret payment   unless the fund paid him to keep the document private <BRK>those document  which offered a window into both doyen s business model and it bank account  were later published on the website known a football leak  the revelation  along with a number of player contract posted on the site  exposed a murky world of soccer finance that wa at best unsavory and at worst in violation of national and international soccer regulation <BRK>ultimately  pinto turned over about   million document and     terabyte of information to a german newsmagazine  der spiegel  which shared document with a select group of news medium outlet who published report on their content <BRK>now that pinto ha been arrested on a portuguese warrant  his case represents a high profile test of a hungarian law passed in   that affords special protection to whistle blower  his lawyer plan to argue that the lead his leaked document provided to a variety of european law enforcement organization outweigh pinto s action <BRK> based on the leak  there have been some extremely important criminal investigation opened with prosecution in various country   said william bourdon  pinto s lawyer  who previously ha represented the national security whistle blower edward snowden   without pinto  this wouldn t have been possible  <BRK>those investigation include several tax case in spain  where top soccer star  including cristiano ronaldo  have been prosecuted for tax evasion after football leak revealed detail of the complicated structure through which they received million of dollar in salary and image right   pinto s lawyer said that he also ha been in contact with french financial crime prosecutor since late    <BRK>more recently  football leak disclosure have targeted the fifa president  gianni infantino  and the way some top club might have circumvented the sport s financial regulation  the revelation also led to the reopening of a sexual assault case against ronaldo <BRK>unlike in most whistle blower case  however  pinto ha no official connection with the soccer industry   no access to club  book or a player  contract   beyond being a fan of the game <BRK> for me  it doesn t make a difference considering what is the basis of whistle blower protection  the intensity of the contribution to the public interest   bourdon said   this is the key point  <BRK>bourdon said pinto already had agreed to assist the authority in switzerland  and that germany s tax agency wa seeking access to his information  too  but it is the decision of a hungarian judge that matter most to him at the moment  since that will determine whether or not he avoids extradition to portugal <BRK> we expect the hungarian judge to be sensitive to the paradoxical situation   bourdon said   that on one hand he s being prosecuted in portugal  while on the other he ha been providing assistance to prosecutor in other country  <BRK>bourdon said that he see little difference between pinto and one of his former client  herv√© falciani  who leaked account detail of client of the british bank hsbc while he worked in geneva  falciani s disclosure  which shook the secretive world of swiss banking  revealed account containing more than    billion  and led to the bank s agreeing to pay   million euro  about    million  to french authority to settle a tax evasion investigation <BRK>spain s high court last september rejected an extradition request for falciani   once labeled the edward snowden of banking   from switzerland <BRK>in addition to pinto s extradition  the portuguese police have demanded the entirety of the computer equipment seized from him in hungary  bourdon called that an overreach because their case is limited to the suspected   extortion attempt <BRK>bourdon acknowledged that pinto had attempted to make contact with doyen once he had the company s document  but he said the extortion charge were not valid because pinto ultimately  didn t follow through  with an operation to secure a payment <BRK>bourdon described the charge a  a tool to criminalize him  to target him a an offender and not a whistle blower  <BRK>little is known about pinto  a der spiegel reporter  rafael buschman  is the only journalist known to have contact with an individual connected with football leak  buschman ha written a series of breathless account and a book detailing his relationship with a man he referred to a  john   der spiegel ha not confirmed pinto is it source <BRK>but a september report the portuguese magazine sabado reported pinto wa the  computer genius  behind football leak  shortly after it article wa published  a message wa posted on football leak  facebook page that appeared to taunt portuguese authority  signing off with   catchmeifyoucan  <BRK>in a video posted to website including youtube after a court appearance in budapest lat week  pinto  dressed in a brown leather jacket and jean  appeared relaxed a he sat on a wooden bench outside the courtroom with his hand cuffed in front of him  pinto s lawyer managed to secure house arrest for him until the judge delivers a verdict <BRK> jurisprudence and regulation say there is a question of proportionality between the seriousness of the offense and the importance to public interest   bourdon said   you could violate the law  could be hacking  or stealing  and if the contribution is tremendous then it s not a crime <BRK> it will be a historic decision for a hungarian judge to make  <BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK>
