<BRK><BRK>by benjamin hoffman and bill pennington<BRK>in the year of offense  the n f l  s championship game didn t have much  a dreary super bowl that featured a combined   punt ended with a sixth title for tom brady and the new england patriot  who beat the los angeles ram       on sunday <BRK>a he ha so many time  rob gronkowski wa there when tom brady needed him most  picking up a pair of huge first down on what proved to be the decisive drive in the patriot  victory <BRK>it wa a year defined offensive brilliance  but at atlanta s mercedes benz stadium  the game turned into a defensive slugfest defined largely the game s punter <BRK>neither team had reached the red zone until midway through the fourth quarter but brady  looking to get something going  twice exploited a coverage mismatch on gronkowski  completing pass of   and   yard to his big tight end  which set up sony michel s   yard touchdown run that put new england up to stay <BRK>the throwback connection between quarterback and tight end proved to be too much for los angeles on a day when coach sean mcvay s highlight reel offense wa forced to punt on it first eight possession of the game   and   time overall   and wa limited to just   total yard <BRK>brady finished the day having passed for   yard while goff  who reached the super bowl in his third season  struggled the entire game and finished with   yard <BRK>julian edelman  with   catch for   yard  wa named the game s most valuable player  completing his comeback from a devastating knee injury last year winning his third career super bowl <BRK> i m pretty ecstatic   julian edelman said in an on field interview  i m emotionally pooped  mentally and physically pooped  <BRK>in what would prove to be a crushing blow to the ram  the patriot were able to follow up sony michel s touchdown with a turnover  a jared goff wa intercepted stephon gilmore late in the fourth quarter  allowing new england to slow the game down and walk away with a victory <BRK>for brady the win gave him a sixth super bowl ring  breaking a tie with the hall of fame defensive end charles haley for the most an individual player  and it tied the patriot with the pittsburgh steelers for the most any team <BRK>here s how the patriot  won their sixth title  <BRK>the patriot just needed to chew up clock  and they did that and more  reeling off   yard on nine play  taking up   minute and   second  and increasing their lead with a   yard field goal stephen gostkowski  they now lead     with     remaining in the game <BRK>the key play on the drive included a   yard run sony and a   yard run rex burkhead <BRK>the ram will receive the ball  but down   point with no timeouts they would need to score immediately  execute an onside kick  and then score again <BRK>possibly inspired new england s touchdown  the ram began racing down the field with a series of long play  but after jared goff s pas to brandin cook just barely fell incomplete at the goal line  goff tried to challenge the new england defense on a second consecutive play and he paid for it when stephone gilmore wa easily able to step in front of the pas for an interception <BRK>the patriot now have the lead and the ball with     remaining in the game <BRK>bill pennington  tremendous anticipation stephon gilmore on the interception  goff tried to go to cook in the same spot a the previous play that nearly resulted in a touchdown  but gilmore wa staring at goff the entire play   he all but turned his back and ignored cook  when goff s pas fluttered  gilmore watched it into his hand the whole way <BRK>tom brady needed to get something going and rob gronkowski wa happy to oblige  two connection between the future hall of famers led to the game s first touchdown  which wa scored on a   yard run sony michel  the patriot now lead      <BRK>the drive started with brady taking advantage of blown coverage samson ebukam to set up an   yard catch gronkowski  just three play later  brady went to gronk again  this time for a   yard gain that ended with the supersized tight end sliding to a stop just   yard short of the end zone <BRK>from there it wa fairly simple a michel ha been almost unstoppable at the goal line in the postseaon and he went into the end zone eaily <BRK>bill pennington  the ram desperately need a sustained offensive drive  their defense is exhausted <BRK>the ram managed to have a nine play drive generate just   yard a a result of penalty and johnny hekker punted for a ninth time  this game ha surely been terrific for hekker s parent  a he is up to   punting yard  but for everyone else it ha been remarkably frustrating to watch a neither team ha been into the red zone yet <BRK>at this point it is seeming like the game will come down to a turnover generating point rather than either offense suddenly waking up  though with either squad point could suddenly accumulate quickly <BRK>if you like punter  this game is great <BRK>after the patriot picked up a first down way of a defensive holding penalty  they got a second on an entertaining   yard run sony michel in which the rookie running back bounced off several defender before being brought down <BRK>michel picked up another   yard on a pair of carry to close out the third quarter  and then on the first play of the fourth quarter  tom brady s pas attempt to james white fell incomplete  setting up yet another punt <BRK>there have been   punt so far <BRK>greg zeurlein just barely lived up to his legatron nickname  tying the game with a   yard field goal that wa not one of his signature booming kick but did enough to get over the crossbar  the game is now tied      <BRK>the ram offense had gotten the ball back quickly thanks to some terrific defensive work from marcus peter  and they picked up a first down with a short throw to josh reynolds and a run c j  anderson <BRK>encouraged the conversion  jared goff threw deep to brandin cook for a picture perfect   yard gain <BRK>a run anderson went for   yard  goff threw an incomplete pas off anderson s back side to avoid a sack  and on  rd and    but goff once again rocketed a ball downfield  connecting with robert wood for an   yard gain <BRK>goff threw incomplete to cook in the end zone  with jason mccourty making a nice play to prevent the touchdown  but goff picked up   yard on second down with a short pas to anderson  on  rd and    goff wa absolutely demolished dont a hightower for a   yard loss that forced the field goal attempt <BRK>while the sack of goff wa a bit demoralizing  the young quarterback looked far more confident on this drive <BRK>the ram had some excitement  but not the kind they wanted  narrowly avoiding a safety on a drive that started on their own   yard line <BRK>the ram got a little breathing room to start the drive with a pair of   yard run todd gurley  on  rd and   from the ram    yard line  jared goff threw wildly to his right to avoid a safety  with the pas falling incomplete <BRK>johnny hekker came out for his eighth punt and proceeded to set a super bowl record with a   yard punt that wa aided a remarkably friendly bounce <BRK>hekker is up to   punt for   yard and ha been a huge help in keeping los angeles from falling further behind in this game <BRK>marcus peter broke up a third down pas intended for julian edelman  forcing new england to punt on it first offensive play of the second half <BRK>the patriot had started the drive on their own   yard line after a terrific punt johnny hekker  but they were able to pick up a huge   yard gain edelman on a short pas from tom brady  once again  los angeles took the blow in stride and continued to play tight defense <BRK>edelman is up to   catch for   yard early in the third quarter  but the patriot have announced that their defense will be short handed the rest of the way  a patrick chung is officially out with an arm injury <BRK>todd gurley is here  but even that wasn t enough to prevent yet another ram punt to start the second half <BRK>the star running back took a second down handoff and raced through the new england defense for a   yard gain  he followed up that burst with two run that combined for   yard  but on  rd and   jared goff s pas to brandin cook wa knocked to the ground stephon gilmore <BRK>johnny hekker came out yet again  punting for the seventh time today <BRK>patrick chung  the patriot  veteran safety  had to come out of the game after appearing to break his right arm on gurley s second run of the drive  he wa replaced duron harmon <BRK>after an almost unwatchable first half  this game can easily be taken over either team in the second half <BRK>for the ram  the key will be finding a way to run the ball  todd gurley ha been almost entirely absent with no explanation  and he and c j  anderson have combined for just   yard on seven carry  that ha let new england s defender pin their ear back and go after jared goff on every play  the third year quarterback ha not responded well  completing   of his   pas  with   of his   yard coming on a pas to robert wood that very likely wa an incompletion <BRK>in the second half  goff need to get back to his confident downfield throw  letting brandin cook and robert wood break off some big play  and if the running game can t help establish that room  goff will simply have to get the ball out faster <BRK>for the patriot  running the ball more would help  but they could improve simply having the ram regress to the mean on defense  marcus peter  aqib talib and nickell robey coleman have all played great game  thanks in part to the ram putting pressure on brady  but the los angeles defense had to spend nearly   minute on the field in the first half  and both peter and robey coleman are prone to mistake if they are challenged repeatedly <BRK>the ram definitely qualify a more frustrated a they failed to score any point despite generating an interception  a missed field goal and a turnover on down  but with how close new england ha tended to stay to their opponent in super bowl  the missed field goal stephen gostkowski in the first quarter could eaily come back to haunt new england <BRK>after a lackluster first half to the super bowl  halftime show headliner maroon   took the stage   a giant  m  stretching   yard across the field   to a barrage of firework and flame  unfortunately the   million fan at home weren t given a respite from the game s mediocrity <BRK>the highlight of the show came about halfway through  when a drum line and choir joined maroon   lead singer adam levine to belt out the hit  girl like you    at home  the highlight for many wa the spongebob squarepants interlude  <BRK>in theory  travis scott and big boi were maroon   s co star  scott rapped  sicko mode    heavily censored on television   early in the show  and big boi appeared late in a classic car  wearing a fur jacket  he sang the outkast hit  the way you move  with levine playing the role of andre   <BRK>in practice they only sang one song a piece  levine even joined big boi  unfortunately playing the role of big boi s outkast co star  andre   <BRK>it wa truly the adam levine show  a he ran through all of maroon   s hit   harder to breathe    this love    she will be loved  and finally ending the show with  sugar   levine grew progressively le clothed throughout the   minute show  and a he sang the final bar of  sugar  he wa shirtle  with flame crackling all around him <BRK>with the super bowl in atlanta  the n f l  had a surfeit of local musician to choose from for the halftime show  outkast  t i   lil jon  future    chainz and migos  the list go on and on <BRK>it seems quite telling of something that they chose maroon      kevin draper<BRK>the first half wa a mess of punt and offensive ineptitude  with neither team looking like the powerhouse they had been throughout the playoff <BRK>it s the lowest first half score since super bowl ix  when the steelers led the viking       at the half <BRK>the ram defense ha played better than anyone could have predicted  holding the patriot to just   point and repeatedly stopping promising drive with tenacious pas defense and occasional burst of interior pressure  but that still added up to los angeles being down at halftime thanks to a horrendous effort from the ram  offense  with all six ram drive ending in punt <BRK>the ram offense generated just   yard in the first half  with jared goff dealing with a great deal of pressure and not being able to get anything going  which is at least partially a result of los angeles not being able to establish the run at all behind todd gurley and c j  anderson <BRK>tom brady threw for   yard in the half  repeatedly picking up first down to julian edelman  but thus far he ha been almost entirely stymied the ram  defense which ha clearly made a point of delivering hard hit and not being discouraged despite the occasional edelman outburst <BRK>the star of the game  if anyone qualifies  are edelman  who ha   receiving yard  and johnny hekker  who ha punted for   yard <BRK>bill pennington  in three postseason game this year  bill belichick s patriot have now given up   point  that s against some pretty decent competition  charger  chief and ram <BRK>tom brady s throw to rob gronkowski on a  th and   from the ram    yard line led to an unexpected turnover on down  ending another promising new england drive <BRK>brady had started the drive with an   yard pas to julian edelman in which edelman ran over aqib talib to secure the first down <BRK>after a short run rex burkhead  edelman picked up another first down  this one with a   yard catch and run in which he wa able to get to the edge to secure an extra yard or two <BRK>the patriot picked up another first down a few play later thanks to the ram having   men on the field  but after brady threw incomplete on consecutive pas he found himself with a  rd and    and his pas to patterson fell just short of converting when marcus peter knocked patterson down just short of the marker <BRK>that set up the  th down play in which gronkowski could not quite get to brady s pas <BRK>bill pennington  jared goff is rushing his throw  out of sync in the pocket  the ram ought to take a page out of the patriot  playbook and settle for some shorter throw  getting the ball out of goff s hand quicker might yield a couple completion and help with his confidence and sense of timing in the pocket <BRK>the ram  who averaged     point a game this season  have had the ball five time and they have punted five time <BRK>todd gurley wa finally back on the field  which seemed like it could be a morale boost for los angeles  and he picked up   yard on a pair of rushing play to start the drive  on  rd and    jared goff rolled out after a play action fake  avoided one sack  but then wa knocked backward for a   yard loss thanks to terrific pressure from kyle van noy <BRK>johnny hekker ha already punted for   yard <BRK>the ram offense could not answer the patriot  score  going   yard on   play  giving the ball back to new england with a punt <BRK>it had briefly looked like the los angeles offense had woken up when jared goff found robert wood on the sideline for an   yard gain that may have benefited from a bad call  a wood did not clearly get both foot down  new england held strong after the play  allowing a   yard pas  knocking c j  anderson back for a   yard loss  and then playing great defense on josh reynolds on a third down pas that fell incomplete <BRK>los angeles ha had absolutely no offensive rhythm in this game while their defense ha been far more impressive <BRK>stephen gostkowski connected on a   yard field goal attempt  putting the patriot up     with     left in the first half <BRK>the scoring drive wa set up a a result of a crucial third down reception julian edelman   no surprise there   a he turned a  rd and   into a   yard gain <BRK>new england struggled after that connection  failing to convert a first down even after tom brady found rob gronkowski on a short pas  but they had gotten close enough for gostkowski to hit fairly easily  making up for his miss earlier in the game <BRK>the team punted on consecutive drive  but the ram made a defensive statement on their last stop of the first quarter  putting some real pressure on tom brady while also dealing with some long gain from new england s receiver <BRK>the quarter closed in a scoreless tie  with neither team threatening beyond stephen gostkowski s missed field goal attempt  but los angeles ha to be encouraged after john franklin myers produced a strip sack  marcus peter very nearly intercepted a pa  and aaron donald forced an incompletion a he whipped brady to the ground  a play that led to new england s first punt <BRK>the ram have yet to do anything on offense in this game  but they have an interception  they are getting to brady  and they have endured a few of julian edelman s signature third down conversion without giving up a score <BRK>bill pennington  the patriot ran twice a many play a the ram in the first quarter  ram had only one first down and were   for   on third down  the ram defense is playing with a lot of energy and fire but the offense look lifeless and uncertain <BRK>new england had a chance to go up     but stephen gostkowski missed wide left on a   yard field goal attempt <BRK>the patriot had started the drive on their own   yard line  but got into their typical rhythm  executing a series of short play that consistently moved the chain  the ram twice had huge defensive opportunity slip away from them  once when julian edelman ripped off an   yard catch and run on  rd and    and once when nickell robey coleman s crushing hit of rex burkhead on a  nd and   wa determined to be a defenseless receiver violation and an automatic first down <BRK>a nice play action fake following the penalty led to a   yard pas to rob gronkowski  but it wa followed a run attempt rex burkhead that went for   yard  a deep pas attempt to chris hogan that fell incomplete in the end zone  and a run james white that went for    leading to gostkowski s ill fated field goal attempt <BRK>a a result of what appeared to be communication issue  new england wa forced to use two of it timeouts on this drive <BRK>bill pennington  the patriot haven t scored but if the ram secondary doesn t move closer to the line of scrimmage and tighten up it coverage  it s going to be a long day for them  brady will take those throw underneath all day long <BRK>gostkowski had not missed a kick in his last five game including the playoff  but he did miss five of   field goal attempt in the regular season and one extra point try <BRK>the patriot were driving down the field fairly easily  picking up a pair of first down on three consecutive run  but nickell robey coleman  the defensive back who committed the controversial pas interference in the n f c  championship  wa able to tip away a pas attempt to chris hogan  leading to an interception cory littleton  absolutely a huge turnover on a drive where the patriot looked to be marching their way to a first quarter score <BRK>the ram managed just two yard on their first two offensive play  with a   yard run todd gurley and an incomplete pas jared goff  on  rd and    goff tried to hit josh reynolds on a crossing route but the team s third wide receiver could not handle the pas and it fell incomplete  leading to a johnny hekker punt <BRK>benjamin hoffman is a senior staff editor and
