<BRK><BRK>the underdoggery and romance of my childhood are out  dynastic rule and the creation of a great new american institution are in <BRK>by ross douthat<BRK>opinion columnist<BRK>i became a besotted baseball fan at the age of    watching the boston red sox  my mother s ancestral team  march to the world series against the new york mets  my parent woke me up near midnight on oct        to come downstairs with them and  watch the red sox win    an eventuality that wa  at that moment  just a single out away  it remained one out away through three single  a devastating wild pitch and an incident that shall not be described involving one william joseph buckner  i wept  slept and awoke a gloomy pessimist  forever haunted the fall of man <BRK>i became a football fan around the same time  and i figured i should root for the patriot a well  in new england solidarity  they had recently played  albeit embarrasingly badly  in a super bowl  so i wa unaware of their long  distinguished legacy of lousy play  but the time i turned   and they were working their way through a     seaon  with a     encore just around the corner  i understood a little better the implication of my choice <BRK>this combination of red sox tragedy and patriot futility defined my relationship to professional sport until adulthood  at which point  a you may have heard  absolutely everything changed for both team and they became insufferably dominant  and my fandom  forged in suffering and melodrama and  wait  till next year  rue  never quite recovered from my favorite team  success <BRK>everyone leaf certain childish thing behind  of course  but there is no greater chasm in the remembered continuity of the self than the gulf separating me from the version of myself whose mind wa at least   percent baseball from february until october and   percent football for the rest of the year  who screamed and raved my way through crucial game and crucial month  and who once talked a bos into letting me off work early because of the psychic damage inflicted aaron boone s sox crushing  american league championship series winning home run the prior night <BRK>i remember that person  but i can t remember how he felt  and trying to raise my child to be new england sport fan in an age of constant new england winning ha given me real sympathy with the lukewarmly religious  the christmas and easter sort of believer who want to impart some measure of piety to their child without really experiencing the flame of faith themselves <BRK>there are reason besides bostonian sport success for the dying of that flame  my current editor probably wouldn t let me out of column writing after a devastating loss  and normal adult obligation leave le time for rereading roger angell s season recapping baseball essay for the  th time <BRK>but the frequent triumph of the sox and pat have been crucial to my loss of ardor  in the old day i wa always mystified about how yankee fan stirred up the same excitement year after year despite their constant winning  and a my team became increaingly yankee like the mystification remained  indeed  i missed the thirst enough to seek the feeling elsewhere   adopting long suffering franchise temporarily  until the kansa city royal ruined our affair winning the world series  to remind myself of what it wa like to nourish long unrequited hope <BRK>despite that infidelity  though  i ve never taken the step of actually rooting against one of my childhood team  which ha kept me connected to both of them  however dutifully <BRK>and now that the patriot have ground their way  in a terrible to watch game highlighted punt  to yet another super bowl victory  i want to report a change in my sport psychology  in my dutiful connection to the latest run of patriot super bowl appearance  i have begun to feel something different  strange and unfamiliar   not a recovery of the old romance  but a growing appreciation of pure  ruthless effectiveness  an admiration for iron efficiency  a joy at the dismantling of highly touted rival  a feeling that almost   almost   make me begin to have a trace of a scintilla of understanding for what it feel like to be a yankee fan <BRK>i say this a someone who feel no particularly personal sympathy or affection for the two men  bill belichick and tom brady  who have delivered the patriot their extraordinary dynaty  belichick is an unpleaant perfectionist whose cultivated public misanthropy and  look at me  a slob  outfit often seem like an irritating sort of performance art  brady preferred the supermodel charm of gisele b√ºndchen to bridget moynahan  the nice catholic ex girlfriend  i saw them at mas together once  so i m totally in her camp  who wa carrying his child   and then succumbed  via gisele  to a pro athlete equivalent of the gwyneth paltrow goop worldview <BRK>and without delving into the arcanum of deflategate  it s obvious that the patriot  search for a competitive edge ha taken them to at least the edge of  you know  cheating <BRK>so the old fake personal bond that i felt for my flawed new england hero   yaz  nomah  bledsoe    isn t there with brady and belichick today  what is there  and increaingly a their dynaty ha become more improbably extended  is something very different  a zest for on field excellence simply for it own sake  a forgiveness of personal and even moral deficiency because the record speaks for itelf  a setting aide of feel good narrative and romantic underdog story because the sheer force of winning trump them all <BRK>oh  did someone say trump  yes  it s appropriate that the patriot are donald trump s favorite team  but not because they have too many white player or because their consistent  grinding  rigorous success somehow resembles his improbable and often ridiculous ascent  rather it s because the patriot are the actual thing that his grifter s instinct and  great again  sloganeering are constantly trying to evoke   a dependably  reliably excellent american institution  of the kind that people in the pre vietnam era took for granted  and that our own era struggle to reproduce <BRK>the patriot are to football what the apollo and manhattan project were to military indutrial complex science  what ibm and general motor were to big buiness  what the hoover dam and mount ruhmore were to public work   with belichick a their patton meet eisenhower impresario  turn a jerk and a bore but a winner above all  they are a throwback  a constant rebuke to the decadence visible in every other american institution  their first fan s white houe very much included   a lat bloom of the can do geniu that won u world war ii  <BRK>  sorry  getting a little carried away here  the point is that unlike my beloved red sox  who now win just often enough to make me feel some catholic with calvinist ancestor guilt over their success  the patriot have over the last few year passed into new territory  a new sphere of fan experience  for the first time since i wa in college and they were scrappy underdog  their every victory make me want them to win more   to boldly go  like neil armstrong and james t  kirk  where no team ha gone before  <BRK>  sorry  carried away again  the point  the point  is that i am a changed fan  or at least a changing one  with every patriot victory  i am winning the victory over myself  i am shedding old habit  jettisoning the underdoggery and romance of my childhood  learning to love dynastic rule <BRK>the super bowl is over  but next season is coming  brady isn t retiring  belichick is going back to his tape and plot and scheme  six super bowl ring  that s nothing <BRK>how did patton put it  american love a winner and can t tolerate a loser  american play to win all the time  <BRK>let s make it seven <BRK>the time is committed to publishing a diversity of letter to the editor  we d like to hear what you think about this or any of our article  here are
