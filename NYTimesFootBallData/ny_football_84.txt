<BRK><BRK>by marc tracy<BRK>san jose  calif    it wa   degree in tuscaloosa  ala   on aug     and nick saban wa feeling the heat <BRK>midway through training camp  many of alabama s younger player had not progressed a saban had hoped  a talented linebacker for the crimson tide  the defending national champion  had recently sustained a severe knee injury  and the prior seaon s starting right tackle had broken his foot <BRK> alabama v  clemson  follow our live coverage from the national championship game <BRK> we don t have enough depth  especially on defense  to afford to be able to lose those kind of player   saban told a group of reporter <BRK>then saban wa asked whether the lack of progress among the more inexperienced player worried him <BRK>and that s when saban  this era s most successful college coach and recruiter  snapped  his expletive tinged remark went viral online <BRK> you just think we  whatever happens  we just    um  spit    another player   he said <BRK>  everything s going to be perfect    he added facetiously   all of our fan think that  you all think that   that s what you write about  that s the message you send out there  <BRK>five month later  saban is one win away from his seventh national title  the no    crimson tide       will face no    clemson       in monday night s championship game  so in fact  everything ha been perfect  or very close to it  with alabama conjuring new  great player  seemingly out of thin air  whenever they were needed <BRK>of all the work that ha positioned alabama to secure it sixth national title in   season   recruiting young star  developing n f l  caliber player  evolving scheme  managing game   the most unheralded might be the program s extraordinary depth  it stack top ranked recruiting class  one on top of the other  over and over and over  nearly every year <BRK>in an era when college football season can stretch to   game  increasing the risk of injury  and when rule restricting player transfer have been loosened  depth ha become the ultimate weapon separating the best from the very good <BRK>somehow  the highest rated prospect in the land appear to be o k  with that <BRK> there s been a major  subtle shift in college football in the last five year that the elite school are using to their advantage   said gary danielson  a cbs sport analyst   crowded depth chart are no longer a hindrance to recruiting  <BRK>brandon huffman  the national recruiting editor for  sport  a high school scouting site  pointed to rahaan evans a a vital precedent  a linebacker ranked no    in his high school clas at the position  he forsook offer from elite program where he would have started immediately and chose alabama  where he did not start until the college football playoff of his junior seaon  after his senior year  evans wa a first round n f l  draft pick in   <BRK>future prospect notice such development  huffman said  they see that paying their due for a couple of year at alabama and starting only a season or two can be worthwhile down the line <BRK> that   huffman said   is why alabama doe what alabama doe  <BRK>deionte thompson  a first team all american safety who did not start until his junior season  said he had chosen alabama because he came  from a winning background  and did not want to be  someplace where i wa miserable losing  <BRK> i wa able to grow so much during the time from me not being a starter to me being a full time starter now   he said   i wouldn t trade a moment  <BRK>not surprisingly  clemson  the other dominant program of the college football playoff era  also hog talent  creating depth rivaled only alabama s  at the start of this season  clemson replaced it starting quarterback  a senior who led the team to a conference title and a playoff berth last season  with a freshman  trevor lawrence  who some measure is considered the highest ranked recruit ever <BRK> those top program  you re going to have competition   said joey king  who wa lawrence s high school coach in georgia   i ve always been leery of coach who guarantee them a chance to play  offer them a chance to compete  that s what trevor wanted  <BRK>for saban and alabama  the most dramatic jettisoning of an established player happened during last year s national championship game <BRK>held scorele through halftime  alabama s offense trotted out it backup quarterback   a true freshman  no le   to replace jalen hurt for the second half  he proceeded to throw three touchdown pas  and the crimson tide won in overtime  it wa a if saban had spent the entire seaon giving minimal playing time to this reserve  a slinging southpaw named tua tagovailoa  on a dare <BRK>now alabama player know that even a two year starting quarterback like hurt is not safe  not even in the middle of his second consecutive national championship game  they also know that should tagovailoa struggle monday night  saban will turn to hurt  a he did during the southeatern conference title game lat month  hurt came in for a struggling and injured tagovailoa and led alabama to a come from behind victory <BRK>because hurt  a junior  completed his bachelor s degree last month  he could transfer after this season and play immediately elsewhere  crimson tide fan need not worry  the new backup to tagovailoa  the runner up for the heisman trophy  will most likely include the fifth  and eighth highest ranked prostyle quarterback among high school senior  including tagovailoa s younger brother <BRK>alabama ha made countless other substitution that have barely been noticed  because of how seamless they were <BRK>take the two player whose injury so agitated saban in august  the right tackle  matt womack  wa a rising junior  and his two replacement  alex leatherwood and jedrick will  were five  and four star recruit  ranked first and eighth in their class  they have been useful contributor on alabama s second ranked offense <BRK>and chris allen s injury could have depleted alabama s depth at linebacker  except the starting unit is monstrously talented  and the backup include a former walk on who ha been with the program nearly six year  a well a a four star recruit who is a redshirt junior  a for the future  the freshman linebacker eyabi anoma is rated a alabama s fourth best recruit ever  julio jones  the atlanta falcon  star receiver  is no     <BRK>how doe alabama do it  the trick seems to be having no trick at all  telling prospect that they will receive the opportunity only to compete  but not necessarily to play <BRK> he s not a big promise guy   billy napier  the louisiana lafayette coach who spent four season overseeing alabama s wide receiver  said of saban   he s very crystal clear about expectation  <BRK>according to alabama coach  recruiting this way produce a virtuous cycle  player are inspired the knowledge that they will see elite competition not only against other team   or   day a year  but also every day in practice <BRK> the amount of work relative to the amount of competition is a huge margin   napier said   there s a year round plan for player development  often about how you practice against competition behind or in front of you at your position  accountability and responsibility go with that  here come a new wave of   player every year that are the most talented in the country  so there s no room for complacency  <BRK>tosh lupoi  the co defensive coordinator  said that alabama  can only put   individual out there  those individual are going to be the best player for that specific package  <BRK>fighting to be one of those    even more than the game themselves   is the ultimate stage of competition   lupoi added   and i think that help u perform on saturday
