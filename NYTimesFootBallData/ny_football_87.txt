 <BRK>  <BRK> with issue of race percolating in the n f l   several player reflect on martin luther king jr  and his protest movement  <BRK> by ken belson <BRK> atlanta   it is doubtful that the n f l  owner understood  when they decided early in   to play the super bowl here  how the city of atlanta  a the cradle of the civil right movement  would serve a a natural forum for the many complicated social and racial issue that have roiled the league in recent year  <BRK> now  many player are showing that the moment is not lost on them  <BRK> on tuesday  devin mccourty  a team captain on the new england patriot  and several of his teammate boarded a bus to pay homage at the martin luther king jr  national historical park in the sweet auburn neighborhood of atlanta  <BRK>  today  when we have a little time off  guy are searching for something to do so they re not just sitting in a hotel room   mccourty said tuesday   with this game  everything is focused on playing sunday  but when you step back and think about it  what better way to be on this stage  with this platform  but also to get a big dose of what s really important   <BRK> often  the super bowl city is merely a prop for the game and party  the patriot  who face the los angeles ram on sunday  have played for the championship in minneapolis  houston and glendale in the past five year  but atlanta  and what it ha stood for  resonates on a deeper level in light of contemporary issue in the league  <BRK> mccourty saw that  he is one of the leader of the player coalition  a nonprofit group that formed to improve social justice and racial equality  it wa organized even before the kneeling protest against racism and police brutality initiated the former san francisco  er quarterback colin kaepernick in the   season  <BRK> the patriot  visit to king s birthplace  his church and a visitor s center wa ad hoc  mccourty wanted to go and eventually an invitation wa extended to his teammate  ten more signed up  <BRK> player in the super bowl rarely get out to see the sight  but this group  with the issue they champion so embroidered in the dialogue of the n f l   said they were determined to make atlanta s civil right history part of their experience  <BRK>  any time i come to the south  i think of my parent   said matthew slater  a wide receiver on the patriot whose parent grew up in mississippi before school were integrated   this is pretty surreal being here  it make you realize there are thing in life that are much bigger than football  at the end of the day  life is so much bigger than what happens in that game on sunday   <BRK> this seaon  the clamor over the protest largely faded a only a handful of player   kenny still of the miami dolphin among them   continued to kneel during the anthem  and before the seaon began  the n f l  backed off a plan to penalize player who do so  <BRK> still  the debate about the protest and their effect on the league ha not been resolved  kaepernick and another player who knelt  eric reid  have case pending against the n f l  accusing it of colluding to keep them off team in retaliation  <BRK> and the choice of gladys knight to sing the national anthem at the super bowl brought the issue back into the spotlight because of comment she had made taking a swipe at kaepernick and other player who did not stand for the anthem   it is unfortunate that our national anthem ha been dragged into this debate when the distinctive sens of the national anthem and fighting for justice should each stand alone   she said in a statement to news organization  <BRK> the n f l  also abruptly canceled a news conference with the halftime act  maroon    the event are normally controversy free  but several pop star said they would not perform with the band because of the league s stance on the protest during the playing of the anthem  <BRK> the league is also on the defensive because the number of minority head coach fell half  to four  after the latest round of firing at the end of the season  <BRK> mccourty and his teammate seemed eager to move on from such controversy and focus on the work they are doing to affect change  <BRK>  for a time  it wa about the anthem  but really  it had nothing to do with the issue in our country   said mccourty  who off the field ha fought for juvenile justice reform   with the anthem  people would just see  is he taking a knee  is he in the locker room  but for player  we didn t care about that  we care about doing thing that help student  help youth  help people in the community   <BRK> in many way  the struggle between trying to effect change through protest and the work of lobbying elected official and working with social advocacy group wa foreshadowed dr  king more than a half century ago  <BRK> in the visitor center across the street from the reflecting pool where king and his wife  coretta  are interred  devin mccourty s twin brother  jaon  a cornerback on the patriot  wa watching a video of king s effort  in    to boost the wage of sanitation worker in memphis  a the video illustrated  king wa asasinated there and his widow ended up holding the peaceful march through the city that her husband had planned  <BRK>  you start to realize that a important is football is  you start to get married family and have kid  there are bigger thing that surround u   he said   though there s a ton of work still to do  being in this mueum and seeing how different time were make you realize there wa some great work done  you didn t realize how bad it wa   <BRK> the player took in the magnitude of the moment  after listening to a park ranger talk about the sanctuary in ebenezer baptist church  where king wa a co pastor  the player got out of the pew  formed a circle in front of the podium where king gave his sermon  held hand  closed their eye and prayed  <BRK>  let s just let this sink in   said jack easterby  a coach who helped organize the excursion   we will tell our child that standing in front of dr  king s church  that it hasn t always been the way it is now   <BRK> another reminder of the tension between protest and change wa on display a few mile away  at the high museum of art  there  an exhibit glenn kaino  a conceptual artist from los angeles  brings to life the one armed salute the sprinter tommie smith at the olympic game in mexico city in    the decision smith and his teammate  john carlos  to raise their clenched fist while wearing black glove on the winner s podium remains one of the most iconic gesture in sport and beyond  <BRK> through print  sculpture  video and item from smith s archive  the exhibit entitled  with drawn arm  show how smith  a world record holder before the olympics  wa outspoken on issue of social injustice well before he raised his fist  it also showed how his view were framed the medium  one set of panel show the cover of newsweek magazine from july     with smith s photo and a headline  the angry black athlete  <BRK> a four minute trailer for an accompanying documentary played on a screen nearby  in one sequence  smith and his wife  delois  are in the white house with president obama  in another  smith   who life about   mile from atlanta   hug kaepernick  <BRK>  tommie represents a historical moment that ha a greater meaning about what went on around it   said michael rook  the curator of the exhibit  which wa extended for the super bowl  the controversy over kaepernick s decision to kneel  is in the present and volatile and very much a moving target on where it will go  where the nfl will go a a policy  what it will mean for fan   <BRK> in a large room with   gold plated cast of smith s arm  suspended from the ceiling and arranged like a   foot long parabola  enrique beher  a cook  and jaelyn sims  a   year old student  said they were impressed with smith s powerful gesture  but also reminded of the debate kaepernick started in the n f l  <BRK>  people think fighting for civil right is about being against america   sims said   but kneeling because you want america to be better  how is that not american   <BRK> ken belson cover the n f l  he joined the sport section in   after stint in metro and business  from   to    he wrote about japan in the tokyo bureau    <BRK>  <BRK>
