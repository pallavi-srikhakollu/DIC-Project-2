state to pas similar measure to protect growing brain from traumatic injury  <BRK> the bipartisan bill  known a no hit  would impose financial penalty for any school league or other entity that doe not comply  <BRK>  there is significant science detailing repetitive head impact have long term neurological consequence  especially when they occur during brain development   one of the bill s sponsor  representative paul a  schmid iii  a democrat  said in a statement  <BRK> although some medical professional and former n f l  player have signaled their support for the measure and public opinion could buoy it prospect  the bill is already facing headwind  <BRK> two representative who initially supported the measure have withdrawn their name from the bill  and a few other legislator said they would not support it  <BRK>  should we ban youth soccer too   asked representative david nangle  a democrat who opposes the bill   or youth hockey  when do we stop legislating into area that we shouldn t be   <BRK> a spokeswoman for u s a  football  which governs youth football  said in a statement that the organization belief that decision on allowing child to play football are  best left to parent   to that end  she said  it ha created a set of guideline developed leader in athlete development and football  <BRK> the executive director of pop warner  jon butler  said in a statement that the organization had worked to improve player safety eliminating the three point stance and removing kickoff for younger athlete   banning football is not the answer  but we do agree that we should continue our effort to make the game safer for our kid   he said  <BRK> study boston university and other research center have shown that child who began playing tackle football before the age of   were at greater risk for cognitive  mood and behavioral issue later in life  a well a condition like chronic traumatic encephalopathy  a degenerative brain diseae linked to repeated hit to the head  <BRK> but there ha been opposition to those finding from the n f l  and even from well intentioned parent  said michael kaplen  a lawyer who teach a legal course on traumatic brain injury and track legislation governing youth tackle football  mr  kaplen said that there wa no such thing a safer tackling and that a youth league s promoting safer tackling would be similar to big tobacco company  offering low nicotine cigarette  <BRK>  people don t understand that even a minor blow to the head ha risk   he said   it may take year for these problem to become unmasked   <BRK> steve dembowski     an executive board member of the massachusetts high school football coach association  said parent  rather than the state  should be able to make choice for their child  <BRK>  considering that kid at that age get concussion playing soccer and baseball and any other sport where they can fall and hit their head on the ground   he said   it seems like an overstep of authority   <BRK> damon stanton     ha two son who play football  and he coach youth football in hanson  mass   about   mile south of boston  <BRK>  i understand the concern   he said  citing the boston university study  but he said more attention should be paid to the work that is being done to make the sport safer since the  knuckle dragging day  when  you would hit hit hit  and run until you were puking  during practice  <BRK> he said his team had invested in new equipment  like foam tire that minimize player contact during practice  and introduced shoulder tackling technique developed u s a  football  <BRK> mr  stanton acknowledged that he might not be a influential a the patriot  head coach  bill belichick  adding that he is not  a political guy   <BRK>  but   he said   i ll definitely be calling my rep to let him know how i feel   <BRK> in recent year  tackle football ha lost some of it luster among middle and high schoolers  and their parent  in    about     million athlete from age   to   regularly played the sport  down slightly from the year before  according to the sport   fitness industry association  rugby is gaining popularity because it tackling technique appear le risky  which increasingly appeal to coach who are leery of concussion  <BRK> there have been move in some part of the country to further address player safety for tackle football at the high school level  this month  the new jersey state interscholastic athletic association adopted new guideline intended to sharply reduce the amount of contact allowed during high school practice  <BRK> but several effort last year to pas statewide legislation governing youth league were quashed grass root movement led parent and coach  <BRK> when assemblywoman valerie vainieri huttle of new jersey proposed banning tackle football for child under    parent  coach and player threatened to vote her out of office  she said in an email  <BRK> that bill is currently in limbo  <BRK>  unfortunately  the old boy  club of politics and football go hand in hand   said m  huttle  a democrat   this bill ha and will continue to receive pushback because it go against the american grain   <BRK> a similar bill in new york failed  and california s safe football act wa pulled before a committee vote  the dave duerson act  named after a chicago bear player who killed himself at age     did not make it past the illinois legislature  and maryland s proposal  which also would have prohibited heading in soccer  wa killed in committee  <BRK> these effort  futile a they sometimes prove to be  still have a positive effect  supporter say  <BRK>  i really did not expect it to pas   said delegate terri hill  the democratic legislator who sponsored maryland s bill  <BRK>  but i think it s a conversation we have to have   she said   and i don t think the conversation is over   <BRK> representative bradley h  jones  a republican who is a sponsor of the massachusetts bill  echoed m  hill  <BRK>  some football program have already made change indicating that there is at least some recognition of this problem   he said   if this bill doe nothing else  i am hopeful that it start a dialogue that will lead to the implementation of best practice and standard across the board to protect kid from long term brain injury   <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
