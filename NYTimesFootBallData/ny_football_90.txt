<BRK><BRK>by victor mather<BRK>if you sat through sunday s football related entertainment  you could be forgiven for swearing off super bowl forever <BRK>that might be too precipitous  quite a few recent game have been thriller with lot of touchdown and exciting moment <BRK>just last year the philadelphia eagle won their first championship in half a century in a   point classic  the year before the new england patriot and atlanta falcon battled into overtime  in the last   year  we have had patriot   seattle seahawks    baltimore raven   san francisco  er   and giant   patriot   <BRK>sunday wa more of a throwback to the late  s and early   s  when the denver bronco or the buffalo bill were getting demolished year after year and super bowl let the public down a frequently a star war prequels <BRK>and come on now  wa sunday s game even really all that bad <BRK>yes  yes it wa <BRK>but with the help of a time machine  or something  maybe we can tweak the past just a little and make sunday s game just a little more like the recent squeaker <BRK>close your eye and imagine <BRK>the new orleans saint brought the n f l  title to bourbon street with a     victory over the new england patriot destined to be a modern classic <BRK>drew brees led new orleans s high powered offense  which scored   or more point six time this season  to one of it most potent result  throwing for six touchdown <BRK>the saint had found their way into the super bowl after los angeles ram cornerback nickell robey coleman wa called for eight different penalty after his helmet to helmet hit on tommylee lewis in the n f c  championship game  the saint scored on the next play  giving the ram too far to come back <BRK>brees showed veteran poise on sunday repeatedly finding lewis and michael thomas   when you re a young quarterback who ha never been to the big game before  you will make mistake against a great defense   brees said   thankfully no one like that faced the patriot today  <BRK>at    tom brady defied his year with an aerial show of his own that fell just short  taking advantage of a saint defense that almost seemed to want him to score  just to get the ball back in brees s hand <BRK>only special team fan were disappointed  a neither team ever sent out the punting unit <BRK>here are the fan celebrating <BRK>the halftime show taylor swift also got great review <BRK>the kansa city chief won their first title since the day of len dawson with a     triumph over the ram <BRK>patrick mahomes threw for five touchdown and ran for one more <BRK>the chief had made it into the big game after an overtime victory in the a f c  championship  they won the coin toss and marched down the field to score  never giving the patriot a touch <BRK>every time mahomes got the ball on sunday there wa a sense that something exciting wa about to happen  a no look pas  a rocket fired into a tiny space  an improvisation that made something out of nothing  about the only thing you knew you weren t going to get wa a punt <BRK>the ram gave a good a they got  with jared goff picking apart the unheralded chief defense for three touchdown of his own  todd gurley provided fan of the running game something to cheer with a   yard effort <BRK>chief coach andy reid kept thing interesting  nearly throwing the game away late with puzzling clock management  repeatedly going into full huddle despite trailing with time expiring  but the error just made mahomes s eventual touchdown scramble with zero second on the clock all the more thrilling <BRK>the chief now look poised to become the sport s new dynaty with the   year old mahomes ready to star for year to come  but the ageless brady and the patriot  the resurgent eagle or steelers  the saint and ram will have something to say a well  it look like a golden age of super bowl is upon u <BRK>the chief hometown paper celebrated <BRK>the halftime show cardi b  also got great review <BRK>now wasn t that more satisfying  maybe next year <BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK>
