determine whether she is eligible for damage  sara blackwell  davis s lawyer  said she believed the arbitrator would rule summer <BRK> i don t want to have to be dealing with this lawsuit   davis said   but i have to remind myself i m doing it for the cheerleader  and for this culture to change  <BRK>greg bensel  a saint spokesman  declined to comment about the case or to make an executive available to discus the accusation against the team <BRK>still  davis s calling out the saint ha led team to re evaluate their cheerleader squad  the saint have given their cheerleader more modest  one piece outfit  ditched their annual swimsuit calendar and hired their first male cheerleader <BRK> now they look like rockettes   gayle benson  the owner of the saint  told the new orleans time picayune in reference to the more restrained uniform   they look like professional dancer   rather than other thing  <BRK>the washington redskin  who have been accused some cheerleader of sexually exploiting them  on a   trip to costa rica  also chose more conservative uniform for their cheerleader  the indianapolis colt cheerleader now wear le revealing uniform  which show no bare midriff

cheerleader more fairly  davis and another cheerleader also offered to drop their case if they could meet with commissioner roger goodell  he demurred <BRK>but blackwell  the lawyer  wa able to meet with anna isaacson  the n f l  s senior vice president for social responsibility  and league lawyer  several month after davis s story broke  the general counsel for the   n f l  team discussed how to

encouraged them to review their program to ensure that they were both appropriate and lawful  since then  it is our understanding club made change  which include providing additional security for public appearance  providing revised social medium policy and providing more organizational support for cheerleading director  <BRK>davis did not expect empathy from the n f l   but longtime squadmates were another story  after an initial flurry of  atta girl  text message from member of the saintations  the saint  cheerleading team  she wa deleted from cheerleader chat group  few of them called when davis s younger brother  justin  wa given a diagnosis of stage   colon cancer last summer  friend who were planning to visit davis in florida  where she wa staying after she left the saintations  canceled their trip <BRK> they were texting me   how could you do this  this is going to make u look bad    davis said <BRK>people hearing about her story from a distance have been more supportive  score of woman  including some former n f l  cheerleader  have thanked her for sticking her neck out and pushing for equal treatment  many of these woman saw her on  megyn kelly today    full frontal with samantha bee  or  most recently   the scarlet letter report   a facebook watch show hosted amanda knox about woman who have been publicly shamed <BRK>davis never imagined she would become a whistle blower  but her dismissal the saint   ostensibly over a photograph she posted on instagram that the team deemed too risqu√©  a well a accusation that she fraternized with a player   changed her attitude <BRK>her complaint exposed rule for cheerleader that she said belonged to agone era  davis said cheerleader had to avoid contact with player  in person and online  even though player were not penalized for pursuing such engagement with cheerleader  the cheerleader had to block player from following them on social medium and could not post photograph of themselves in saint gear  they were told not to dine in the same restaurant a player  or to speak to them in any detail  if a saint cheerleader entered a restaurant and a player wa there  she had to leave  if a cheerleader wa in a restaurant and a player arrived afterward  she had to leave <BRK>after her three year on the sideline and many year of watching her mother work a a choreographer for the saintations  davis s love of the n f l  vanished  she recoil when she enters a restaurant and see an n f l  game on a television there  she look away when she see fan wearing saint jersey and shirt  she walk out of the living room when her brother compartmentalizes her legal battle and watch the saint on television <BRK>davis keep a low profile most day  she dropped out of the university of southern mississippi  where she wa studying communication  and work at her mother s dance studio  she help her mother care for her brother  she want to return to performing  though not on an n f l  field <BRK>for now  she is focused on finding balance after a tumultuous year  in january  she began a   day social medium  cleansing  that included abstaining from checking her instagram account  this ha helped her avoid online bully and reflect on why she filed her claim <BRK> supporting the n f l  is supporting a culture that is discriminating to woman  put woman down and is all about money and power   she said   the whole culture is so outdated  <BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK>
