<BRK><BRK>by the associated press<BRK>augusta  ga    given the air that augusta national put on for those watching at home   pristine fairway  dazzling azalea  stately pine and polite patron   one would think the master is being contested in some genteel countryside  far from the blotch of civilization <BRK>that assessment couldn t be further from the kitschy truth <BRK>welcome to washington road <BRK>right outside the gate of one of the world s most exclusive golf club sits a hodgepodge of sprawling strip mall  fat food joint  energy drink hawker  a replica stock car covered in sponsor decal and  yes  john daly decked out in a dalla cowboy t shirt and flip flop  taking a drag on a cigarette a he sign autograph and move merchandise in the raucous parking lot outside hooter <BRK>working from his rv  daly seems about a far away a one can get from augusta national <BRK>actually  he s le than a mile from the first tee <BRK>another tradition unlike any other <BRK> the hooter tradition   daly quipped saturday   it s just awesome  we ve got like     to     people coming through here  <BRK>this is the side of augusta that the guy in the green jacket would prefer to hide from the rest of the world  in fact  they ve been busy buying up property around their cherished club  but washington road still maintains that distinctly american feel of urban sprawl run amok <BRK>the five lane highway   two lane in each direction  plus a center turn lane that requires the skill of mario andretti to navigate   is packed with aggressive driver  whose rage and need for speed is only enhanced the bumper to bumper gridlock that prevails from early in the morning to well into the night during master week  sidewalk are a hit and miss affair  for those trekking along washington road on foot  it s more like a treacherous hike across matted down grass and makeshift trail created all that foot traffic <BRK>jaywalking is only for the bravest of patron  it doesn t feel all that safe to navigate this asphalt jungle from the supposed haven of a crosswalk  augusta national is planning to build a massive tunnel underneath washington road  which will surely extend the lifespan of those making the trek on foot <BRK> washington road is not geared for pedestrian   said frank mosley  who ran a florist shop right across the street from augusta national for decade   it s made for car going fast  <BRK>year ago  mosley remembers traffic coming to a halt for president eisenhower s motorcade  which wa ferrying him to augusta national to play a few round  mosley still ha a note from first lady mamie eisenhower thanking him for making her a corsage  he reminisced about tom watson stopping in along with his wife to order a floral arrangement <BRK> we re one stop from heaven   mosley said  glancing across washington road <BRK>approaching his  th birthday  mosley decided to shut down his flower shop a few month ago  he s talked with augusta national official about buying it  but they told him it wan t on their radar at the moment  so there he wa saturday  holding up a hand written sign along wahington road to advertise parking for the rather reasonable price of    a car  before the leader had even teed off  he d filled his   available space   and even picked up a pair of sunday ticket from his next to last customer  who said he wan t returning for the final round <BRK>this will be the first time mosley ha attended the tournament in at least a decade <BRK> i ve never had the time   he said   these people are our guest  we should treat them like that  so we give them a place to park  <BRK>too bad mosley closed his florist shop  it certainly added a tad bit of sophistication to a stretch of highway mainly known a a source of heartburn and future angioplaties <BRK>while washington road is in the address for one of augusta s better known restaurant  tbonz steakhouse  you re more likely to wind up at arby s  offering  king hawaiian sandwich  for a limited time  or wendy s  where the  biggie bag with bacon double stack  go for a mere five buck  or the curry hut  for alleged indian food  or waffle house  for scattered and smothered  with two location conveniently located just a few hundred yard apart on each side of the i   interchange  <BRK>and  of course  there s hooter and it favorite son <BRK>daly hasn t played the master since    but he s become a fixture at the washington road eatery known mainly for it scantily clad waitress and double entendre name <BRK>the two time major champion  whose best finish at the master wa a tie for third in    sell gaudy t shirt and camouflage hat  ball marker and pin flag  not to mention head cover and license plate and his own music cd   pretty much anything that brings in a buck for a golfer well known for his personal foible and financial misstep <BRK>daly is an appropriate symbol of the class is overrated philosophy that prevails along washington road  the perfect counterbalance to the staid guardian of the game who hold court behind the heavily guarded gate of augusta national <BRK>but he s quick to point out that this is a one week a year phenomenon <BRK> it s unbelievable this week   daly said  before cocking his head and adding with a knowing smile   but if you come through here two week from now  it s going to be a little desolate  it just go to show you what the master mean to this community  <BRK>and to washington road  especially <BRK>for one week a year  urban sprawl get a chance to shine in all it tacky glory <BRK>___<BRK>follow paul newberry on twitter at www twitter
