 <BRK>  <BRK> by the associated press <BRK> augusta  ga    tiger wood blazing to victory in his sunday red at the master  a scene once so familiar  wa never more stunning  <BRK> it wa only two year ago at augusta national that wood needed a nerve block just to hobble upstairs to the champion dinner  unsure he would ever play another round of golf  he had a fourth back surgery with hope of simply playing with his two child  not chasing jack nicklaus in history  <BRK> and now it s all pieced back together   his life  his back  even golf  <BRK> a fallen hero  a crippled star  wood is a master champion again  <BRK> he won his fifth green jacket  his  th major  but never with this much raw emotion  the most ferocious fist pump wa when he walked off the  th green  scooped up   year old son charlie  and embraced his mother and his   year old daughter sam  <BRK>  for them to see what it s like to have their dad win a major championship  i hope that s something they will never forget   wood said  <BRK> who can ever forget this day  <BRK>  it s hard to really feel bad about how i played because i just witnessed history   said xander schauffele  one of three player who finished second   it wa really cool coming down the stretch  all the historic hole  tiger making the roar  i feel like i got full master experience   <BRK> the comeback go beyond the two shot deficit he erased before a delirious audience that watched memory turn into reality  <BRK> it had been   year since he last won the master   no one had ever gone that long between green jacket  he had gone nearly   year since his last major  the   u s  open at torrey pine on a shattered left leg  <BRK> this wa bigger  <BRK> wood never missed a shot that mattered over the final seven hole  taking the lead with a   iron to the fat of the green on the par    th for a two putt birdie  delivering the knockout with an   iron that rode down the ridge the cup and settled   foot away for birdie on the par    th  <BRK> he tapped in for bogey and a   under    and the celebration wa on  <BRK>  wooooooo     wood screamed a he headed for the scoring room with chant of  tiger  tiger  tiger   he had never hugged more people  everyone in his camp who stood him through a public divorce  an embarrasing mug shot from his duo arrest when he took a bad mix of painkiller and the four back surgery  the most recent to fuse his lower spine <BRK>  i had serious doubt after what transpired a couple of year ago   wood said   i could barely walk  i couldn t sit  couldn t lay down  i really couldn t do much of anything      to have the opportunity to come back like this  it s probably one of the biggest win i ve ever had for sure because of it   <BRK> president donald trump  who ha played with wood at his florida course  had two tweet of congratulation  fenway park posted the news on the scoreboard  <BRK> a comeback for the age  <BRK> it rate among the best because wood ha meant so much to so many in a sport he ruled for so long  whether he can dominate it again is still to be determined  wood needed some help to win this master  six player had a share of the lead at some point on the back nine  and there wa a five way tie at the top when the final group wa still on the  th fairway  <BRK>  you couldn t have had more drama than we all had out there  and now i know why i m balding   wood said   this stuff is hard   <BRK> it didn t look that way when he wa younger  healthier and the most popular sporting figure in the world  <BRK> wood lost his impeccable image to a sex scandal  one of the swiftest and most shocking downfall in sport  he lost his health to back problem  he went two year without even playing a major  <BRK> now the comeback is truly complete  and the race is on  <BRK>  a big  well done  from me to tiger   nicklaus tweeted   i am so happy for him and for the game of golf  this is just fantastic     <BRK> wood now is three short of the gold standard     major   set nicklaus  <BRK>  i think   is a whole lot closer than people think   brook koepka said  <BRK> joe lacava  the caddie who stayed with wood even when he didn t play for the better part of two year  said they have talked about the record  <BRK>  we re on   and i said   let s get to     you can t be on   and thinking about     lacava said   but now we can start talking about    so we re getting closer   <BRK> it wa the first time wood won a major when trailing going into the final round  francesco molinari  the   hole leader  wa still up two shot heading into the heart of amen corner  <BRK> and that s when all hell broke loose  <BRK> molinari s tee shot on the par    th never had a chance  hitting the bank and tumbling into rae s creek for double bogey  until then  molinari had never trailed in a round that began early in threesome to finish ahead of storm  <BRK> and then it seemed a though practically everyone had a chance  until wood delivered the key shot at the big moment  just like the old day  <BRK> schauffele failed to birdie the par    th and scrambled for par the rest of the way for a    dustin johnson made three straight birdie late in the round  but he got going too late and had to settle for a   and a return to no    in the world  <BRK> wood go to no     his first time inside the top   since the   pga championship  <BRK> koepka  one of four player from the final two group who hit into the water on no     rallied with an eagle on the  th  narrowly missed another eagle on the  th and wa the last player with a chance  his birdie putt on the  th from just outside   foot missed  and he had to settle for a    <BRK>  you want to play against the best to ever play   koepka said   you want to go toe to toe with them  i can leave saying i gave it my all  he s just good  man   <BRK> wood finished at   under   and became  at    the oldest mater champion since nicklaus won his sixth green jacket at   in    that ha stood a augusta s defining moment for year  <BRK> this one is sure to at least rival it  <BRK>  this is definitely  probably one of the greatest comeback i think anybody s ever seen   koepka said  <BRK> koepka and molinari had both faced tigermania in the major and held their own  molinari at carnoustie to win the british open  koepka lat summer at bellerive to win the pga championship  molinari went   straight hole without a bogey  a streak that ended on the seventh hole  it wa the double bogey that cost him  and the italian wa gracious a ever in defeat  <BRK>  i think i made a few new fan today with those double bogey   he said  <BRK> rain fell briefly  but it stayed away long enough for wood to be presented his green jacket on the practice green  just like old time  <BRK> he looked like a new man  making new memory  <BRK>  now i m able to play golf again  and do it at an elite level again  which is something i m just very blessed to be able to have that opportunity again   wood said  <BRK> ___ <BRK>  <BRK>
