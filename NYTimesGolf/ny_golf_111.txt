 <BRK>  <BRK> by the associated press <BRK> augusta  ga    ed sneed sat on a sofa in butler cabin at augusta national looking a though he didn t know what hit him  <BRK> he had a three shot lead with three hole to play in the   master and didn t do anything horribly wrong  except nothing went right  he finished with three straight bogey and faced a sudden death playoff with fuzzy zoeller and tom watson  which zoeller won with a birdie on the second extra hole at no     <BRK> arnold palmer wa conducting the interview in butler cabin and sympathized  so did watson  who wa sitting next to sneed  watson had lost in a three way playoff the previous major at the pga championship  which cost him the career grand slam  <BRK>  i know what it feel like to be in that position   watson said   all the condolence in the world wouldn t fix what the hurt is right now inside of him  he ll have plenty of tournament left  he s a great player  he showed it this week   <BRK> there were other tournament  sure  but sneed played the master only three more time  <BRK> he never got another chance  <BRK> the hurt never really go away  <BRK>  it s something that stick with you   sneed said from his home in ohio   i never won many tour event  but i m remembered more for losing that one   <BRK> at the master  he s not alone  <BRK> the fabled green jacket is almost close enough to feel it slipped over the shoulder  and then it s gone  and for some  the opportunity never return  <BRK> scott hoch missed a   foot putt in a playoff in   and lost to nick faldo on the next hole  hoch at least had another chance six year later when he went into the final round one shot out of the lead  shot   and tied for fifth  <BRK> greg norman is not the most frequent runner up at the master  just the most famous  he had more than one opportunity  <BRK> not so for chad campbell in    the first man out in a three man playoff won angel cabrera  <BRK>  it wa early enough in my career  i felt like i wa going to have a lot more opportunity to have a chance to win   said campbell  missing the master this year for the ninth straight year  <BRK> not for len mattiace in    who lost in a playoff to mike weir  <BRK>  it hurt that night   mattiace said   i played hilton head the next week and it hurt the same  it didn t really change ever   <BRK> sneed won four time on the pga tour   oddly enough  three were in a playoff   and he wa right that he is known more for the one playoff he lost  for about a dozen year after that master  he could count on someone calling and wanting to talk about that shocking finish  <BRK>  i ve replayed that many  many time in my mind   sneed said   actually  it s the only place you can replay it because you can t go back there   <BRK> mattiace s only chance wa in    right after augusta national had super sized the golf course  even with a bogey on the  th hole  mattiace shot a   in the final round and wa on the verge of winning until weir finished with two tough par putt  <BRK> the playoff effectively ended in one shot  mattiace went first at the par    th and tugged it left  stymied a tree  he chipped through the green  and his par putt ran to the fringe  he missed that one  too  taking double bogey  <BRK>  i tried to keep perspective   mattiace said   i had a great tournament  i shot    everything wa great  but when you get in that position  you want to cap it off and get a w  so i keep that perspective  but it hurt just the same   <BRK> later that year  mattiace tore knee ligament while skiing and when he returned to the master  he could barely walk and missed the cut  <BRK> that turned out to be his last master  <BRK> campbell never expected to be in a playoff in   until kenny perry bogeyed his last two hole  suddenly  campbell had the advantage  perry had come up short of the  th green  cabrera wa in the tree and hit another tree trying to get out  he managed to save par  <BRK>  i drove it perfect  just up the right side and had   yard   campbell said   it set up perfect for me  i d like to have that one back   <BRK> he put it into a bunker  blasted out to   foot and missed the par putt  cabrera won on the next hole  <BRK> campbell returned to augusta national the next year  with no reason to believe that would be his last year  he doesn t let much in life linger  if anything cause him to think back  it s the master  <BRK>  the longer it go  you look back and feel like it s the one that got away   he said  <BRK> chris dimarco played in the final group two straight year at the master  he had faded long before phil mickelson made his   foot putt to win his first major in    there wa no fading against tiger wood in    dimarco pushed all day until wood made birdie on the first playoff hole  <BRK>  i ve never gotten more notoriety than finishing second in a major   dimarco said  <BRK> it wa what he said that afternoon at augusta that wa so telling   i will be ready to win next year   <BRK> but he fell while skiing and injured his back on a bottle that wa in his backpack and wan t quite the same  he played the master twice more and missed the cut  <BRK> and he never made it back  <BRK>  <BRK>
