 <BRK>  <BRK> by reuters <BRK> augusta  ga    tiger wood  laid up  with a chip shot during the first round at the mater  where he missed a couple of short putt early before briefly reminding everyone of his former glory a he posted a two under par   on thursday  <BRK> fourteen year since his last master triumph    time major winner wood birdied the  th and  th hole to tie for the lead at augusta national  <BRK> yet a couple of poor drive down the stretch  along with a judgment error  left the four time master champion four stroke behind leader brook koepka and bryson dechambeau on a day of fluctuating wind and devilish pin position  <BRK>  it s not a bad start   wood said  <BRK>  i missed a few  putt  for sure  misread a couple and hit a bad one at six  other than that it wa a good solid day   <BRK> after a two putt birdie at the par five  th  wood picked up another shot at the  th when he threaded his   yard approach shot through the pine and then sank a sharply breaking   foot putt  giving an understated little fist pump a the patron roared their approval  <BRK> when he drove down the middle at the par five  th  leaving   yard to the pin  it seemed likely wood would take the outright lead  <BRK> yet one poorly judged four iron shot  aided a strong tailwind  pricked his balloon  <BRK>  get down  down  down   he barked at his ball while it wa in the air  before adding  oh my god  when he saw it overshoot the green  <BRK> the ball landed on a downslope and bounded   yard beyond the hole  leaving a devilishly difficult pitch shot  <BRK> with the pond on the other side of the green waiting to gobble up anything struck even a tad too firmly  he decided to be cautious   <BRK> the   year old struck a heavy wedge shot which never had a chance of making it up the slope  but at least he avoided the water  <BRK>  probably the hardest shot i had all day   he said   it wa up on a root and i had to play short  <BRK>  i laid up on my chip to make sure i didn t catch the root and blade it in the water  <BRK>  i had an easy up and down  with the next chip  and wa able to move on with par   <BRK> later  wood carved his drive into the tree at the par four  th  and though he found a nice gap for his second shot  he came up short of the green and bogeyed the hole  <BRK> earlier  wood missed a five foot putt at the fifth and an even shorter one at the next  he also missed a great birdie chance at the par five eighth before a birdie at the ninth provided a positive launching pad to the back nine  <BRK>   reporting andrew both  editing toby davis  <BRK>  <BRK>
