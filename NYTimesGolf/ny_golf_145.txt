<BRK><BRK>by the associated press<BRK>augusta  ga    jordan spieth ha become an afterthought on the pga tour <BRK>even at the course where he usually play so well <BRK>adding another entry to his yearlong slump  spieth struggled to a   over   thursday in the opening round of the master and wa a whopping nine shot off the lead  not exactly the sort of start he wa looking for at a major championship that he won in    where he s twice been a runner up and finished third another time  a big reason he call it  my favorite tournament in the whole world  <BRK>up to now  spieth s worst showing at this place wa a tie for  th in   <BRK>making the cut is his main priority at the moment <BRK>spieth s misery wa epitomized at the par   sixth hole  where he pushed his tee shot right of the green and followed with a terrible pitch  the ball rolling back off the front  he ran the chip   foot past the cup and missed the putt for a double bogey <BRK>it wa more of the same at the ninth <BRK>spieth s approach to the tiered green caught the front slope and rolled back into the fairway  the texan tried to pitch it up with his third shot  only to come up short again  watching helplessly a the ball rolled back to where he wa standing in what anyone watching at home probably thought wa a replay  he finally kept one on the green with his next swing but settled for his third bogey on the front side <BRK>up to now  spieth s wedge game had been the only thing keeping him somewhat in the game <BRK>on a sunny day at augusta national  that seemed to abandon him a well <BRK>spieth pulled thing together somewhat after the turn  stringing together a bunch of par to go with a birdie at the par    th  when he stuck his tee shot   foot from the flag and rolled in the putt  but all that did wa keep him from eclipsing the worst score of his master career <BRK>while it may have seemed strange to the casual fan to see spieth struggling so mightily  this wa really nothing new <BRK>since his third place showing at last year s master  when he finished two shot behind patrick reed  spieth ha managed only one top   finish   and that s when he fell apart in the final round of the british open  the   year old texan bumbled his way to a   that put him four shot in arrears of winner francisco molinari  who certainly played well enough to win but benefited mightily from spieth s collapse <BRK>turn out  that performance is the highlight of spieth s past year <BRK>in   other stroke play event  he s missed the cut six time and finished an average of   shot behind the winner in the other tournament <BRK>fourteen <BRK>an afterthought  indeed <BRK>and maybe in a bit of denial <BRK> i feel like my recent result aren t a tell of where my game is actually at   he said a few day ago   i feel really good about my game  where it s at  heading into this week  it s just a matter of trust in the stuff that i m working on  and i don t feel like i have to play well  i don t feel like there s any added pressure this week  i feel kind of under the radar  which is really nice  <BRK>of course  it would be foolhardy to write off a guy who s already won three major title and need only the pga championship to complete a career grand slam <BRK>but some wonder if spieth s physical limitation   he s never been one to boom it off the tee   ha left him too little margin for error when he s struggling with the putter and short game <BRK>a usual  spieth ranked only  st out of   player in driving distance      yard  nearly   yard shy of leader rory mcilroy   but he also placed  th in driving accuracy   th in green hit in regulation   nd in proximity to the hole   th in scrambling and  nd in number of putt <BRK>spieth didn t speak with the medium after his round <BRK>he headed straight to the range <BRK>there were certainly plenty of thing to work on <BRK>___<BRK>follow paul newberry on twitter at www twitter com pnewberry  his work can be found at http   apnews com search paul  newberry<BRK>___<BRK><BRK>
