<BRK><BRK>on golf<BRK>by karen crouse<BRK>pebble beach  calif    the celebration wa muted  even if pebble beach golf link wa at it most radiant on monday morning  with clear sky and bright sunshine casting the pacific ocean  the  th hole and phil mickelson in an exquisite light  mickelson turned to paul casey  the player he had vanquished to win his fifth pebble beach pro am title after a lengthy weather delay  to thank him for helping produce the sublime stagecraft <BRK>with casey carrying a three stroke lead into the final round  mickelson wa forced to bear down over the final    and he produced a seven under   in the final round  mickelson s   hole total wa   under    three stroke better than casey  a friend and fellow arizona state alumnus <BRK>so focused wa mickelson during the last round that he tried to persuade casey and tournament official to finish the final two hole amid fading light sunday evening <BRK>casey  who ended up winning the team event with his amateur partner  don colleran  declined to play on  and after they both finished with a par and birdie on the final hole in front of a robust crowd of early riser the next morning  mickelson gave credit where it wa due <BRK> paul made the tough call  but it wa the right decision   mickelson said  adding   sometimes i just get in my own little bubble and i don t see the big picture  <BRK>mickelson s decision making in the caldron of competition can sometimes be a liability  a wa evident in his collapse on the final hole of the   u s  open at winged foot   or more recently  in his decision to one time a moving putt during the third round of lat year s u s  open at shinnecock hill <BRK>but in closing out his  th pga tour victory this week  mickelson     wa a study in restraint  after his birdie putt at the  th hole dropped  he picked the ball out of the hole a though he were retrieving a package from his front stoop  it wa mickelson s second victory in nearly a year   he won the world golf championship event in mexico city lat march   and his first on u s  soil in     day  since he captured the   wate management phoenix open <BRK>any victory is special at pebble beach  a historic venue with personal resonance for mickelson and his family  but he hope a more meaningful celebration on the  th green awaits him in june  for the  th u s  open   the only major tournament that mickelson ha not won <BRK>can he strike gold twice at pebble beach in the same year  two men have proved it s possible  jack nicklaus in    on his way to a seven victory season  and tiger wood in    when he won nine pga tour event  nicklaus wa in his  s in   and wood in his  s in    both at the peak of their power <BRK>mickelson will turn   on the final day of this year s u s  open  and a win would make him the oldest men s major champion  surpassing julius boros  who wa   when he won the   p g a  championship  mickelson s younger brother and caddie  tim  suggested people discount mickelson s chance at their peril <BRK> he s won twice now in the last   month   tim mickelson said  adding   obviously it show he can win still  <BRK>mickelson s game appears to be aging a well a did the bottle of   roman√©e conti wine that he drank from the claret jug after winning the   british open  he ha a second and a first in his lat three start   with a missed cut at the phoenix open sandwiched in between  the resurgence of mickelson and the   year old wood ha made the men s game infinitely more compelling <BRK> i believe that if i play my best  if tiger play his best  it s good enough to win on any week   mickelson said  adding   i just think that both myself and tiger are going to have a really  really good year  <BRK>mickelson and wood both have found their way to the winner s circle more recently than either jordan spieth or rory mcilroy have  like mickelson  spieth and mcilroy are each one major title from completing a career grand slam  mcilroy     will get his opportunity first  at the master in april  spieth s turn will come next  at the p g a  championship in may <BRK>and then the spotlight will settle like a laer beam on mickelson  who played his first major a a pro at the   u s  open at pebble beach  he noted that this year marked the  th anniversary of his maternal grandfather s debut a a pre teen caddie at pebble beach  where he made   cent a round <BRK>during the greenside trophy presentation  mickelson told the story of how his grandfather  al santos  who grew up in monterey  calif   dropped out of school in the fourth grade to help support his family and shortly thereafter found his way to the pebble beach caddie shack <BRK>mickelson said his grandfather carried a   silver dollar in his pocket while he worked  and pased it down to mickelson  who us it a a ball marker whenever he play here  mickelson describes the place a special now  but after he missed the cut at the   u s  open  he skipped the tour stop here in   and   <BRK> i don t know i had a good big picture of the overall importance of the tournament to the game and what it provides and how much i love the place   mickelson explained in   <BRK>playing pebble beach ha taught mickelson to take nothing for granted  he wa trailing two stroke after   hole in   but never got a chance to make a charge a inclement weather wahed out the final two round  two year later  mickelson successfully outlated mother nature and the field for his first pebble beach pro am title <BRK>in    the tournament s first two round were played in stormy weather in february  which rendered the course soft and the green slow  and the final round took place under bright sunshine in august  and the course wa fat and firm   a it should be in june for the u s  open  in winning his first pro am title  mickelson might have acquired the blueprint for realizing his lat major goal in golf <BRK> i have such great memory here   mickelson said   i would love to add to it  <BRK>but mickelson added that he wouldn t allow himself to look any further ahead than the master  he ha spent so long fixated on winning the u s  open  but this week taught him the beauty that can reward those who see the big picture
