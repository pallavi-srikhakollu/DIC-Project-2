 <BRK>  <BRK> by the associated press <BRK> augusta  ga    phil mickelson flashed the faraway look of a man approaching a half century of life  clearly pondering where the time went  <BRK>  it go fast   he reminisced  glancing toward the rolling hill and towering pine beyond the augusta national clubhouse  <BRK> then  just like that  lefty snapped out of it  <BRK> he s got his sight on a fourth green jacket  <BRK>  i think i ve got another major in me   mickelson said confidently   at least one  maybe two  i would love to get one right here   <BRK> the  th round of his master career wan t all that memorable  a middling   over   friday in which he wa forced to scramble mightily to overcome a wayward driver  <BRK> but it wa enough to keep him in the thick of thing after an opening round    to give him a shot at becoming the oldest player to win one of golf s major championship  <BRK> for a sport that can be a bit lethargic  needlessly complicated and way too stuffy  this remains one of it overwhelming charm  <BRK> on any given day  the old guy can still go swing for swing with all those buffed up youngster  giving u all a bit of hope a we approach middle age and beyond  clear evidence that our golden year don t have to be confined to a rocking chair  <BRK> that s especially the case at augusta national  which embrace the geezer like a warm  comfy blanket  <BRK>  every time i come here  i just feel like a kid again   mickelson said   it s so much fun   <BRK> he s already got one major title since entering his  s  capturing the   british open at age    now  with his  th birthday a little over two month away  there s little doubt that he s still got the game to win another  <BRK>  i expected to be a little bit better  to be honest   said mickelson  whose   under   left him three shot off the lead   but there s nothing better than having a chance going into the weekend at the master  and that s what i want to focus on  i know that i m playing well enough   <BRK> a with all sport  golf will always be a young man s game  <BRK> a player is far more likely to win a major title in his  s than his  s  <BRK> but there s a good three dozen member of the over   major champion club  and it seems only a matter of time before someone in their  s break through to win one of the biggest event  <BRK> for now  the oldest to do it wa julius boros  at the pga championship way back in    when he wa about four month past his  th birthday  but tom watson very nearly captured the   british open at age    squandering a lead with a bogey on the  nd hole and losing to stewart cink in a four hole playoff  <BRK> mickelson already ha a victory this seaon and it s not at all far fetched to envision him contending for a few more championship after he turn   on june     which just happens to be the same day a the final round of the u s  open at pebble beach  site of his most recent triumph a mere two month ago  <BRK> the mater leaderboard also included a pair of   year old  tiger wood and ian poulter  but  really  the most impressive performance of the first two day wa turned in bernhard langer  the   year old german who is graying at the edge but still look a fit a he did in his prime  <BRK> langer isn t going to win the tournament  but he eaily made the cut  cruising around the course he know so well with round of   and    he can t hit it a far a those player half a age  and then some   but he know each nook and cranny of the course  the sort of local knowledge that go far at a place such a this  <BRK> not that he d turn down a dip in the fountain of youth  <BRK>  i m hitting a   iron and  younger player are  hitting a   iron   langer quipped   i would rather hit a   iron and have a little le experience   <BRK> he closed out friday s round with three birdie on the last five hole  putting him one shot ahead of   year old jordan spieth and ensuring he would finish above the cut line for the fifth time in the last seven year  <BRK> but father time will catch him one of these day  <BRK> just ak ian woosnam  the diminutive welshman who won the mater in    the same year mickelson made his augusta debut a an amateur from arizona state  <BRK> sharing langer s age but plagued a bad back  woosnam is no match for this course  hasn t been for the better part of two decade  he wanted to quit a few year ago  but his spouse wouldn t let him  <BRK>  i got a telling off from my wife   woosnam joked   she said   get out there and do it again   <BRK> but friday s round wa his last at augusta national  <BRK> if woosnam come back again  it will just be for fun  after round of   and     and missing the cut for the  th year in a row   he announced his mater retirement a soon a he walked off the  th green  <BRK>  it doesn t seem to get any better   woosnam said  in word that everyone can relate to with the passing of the year   maybe if they will give me a cart or something like that  i ll come back  that would be all right  but i don t think i ll get that   <BRK> woosnam savored the laugh and the memory  <BRK> this part of his journey wa done  <BRK> in the end  the year always win  <BRK> but in golf  sometimes  it take them longer
