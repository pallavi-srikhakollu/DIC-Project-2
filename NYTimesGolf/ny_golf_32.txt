 <BRK>  <BRK> by reuters <BRK> augusta  ga    after   master appearance  it is hard to catch three time champion phil mickelson off guard even with a revamped fifth hole that ha been the talk of augusta national this week  <BRK> steely play may be in order at the redesigned magnolia  where the tee ha been moved back   yard  but mickelson told reporter on tuesday that he wa taking it in his stride  <BRK>  i think            is a very difficult four hole stretch and making it a little bit harder i think is a good thing   mickelson said   i always like making hard hole harder   <BRK> experience on the difficult green is something mickelson can rely on to help snag a green jacket for the fourth time  with his  th career round at the master slated for friday  <BRK>  there are always little subtlety and nuance that you have to relearn   he said  <BRK>  every time i come out here and practise  i pick up a little something here or there that i did not know on how to play a certain shot from a certain position to a certain pin   <BRK> if he can secure victory  it will be defying the odds  mickelson  who will turn   in june  is roughly two and a half year older than the oldest master champion jack nicklaus  who claimed his sixth victory in   at the age of     <BRK> mickelson already ha a career befitting one of the game s great  having spent over   year on the pga tour  with   top   finish    pga championship and five major win   <BRK> that doe not mean he is looking to slow down anytime soon  <BRK>  there s no reason now with the knowledge we have in fitness  the knowledge we have in biomechanics  and the knowledge we have with nutrition and so forth  that we  at a much older age than in the past  should not be able to perform at a very high level   mickelson said  <BRK> the only major to elude him ha been the u s  open  in which he ha either tied for or placed second on six time   <BRK> but after winning the pebble beach pro am in february  it seems a career grand slam may still be in reach since this year s u s  open will be played on the same course  <BRK>   reporting amy tennery  editing ken ferris  <BRK>  <BRK>
