 <BRK>  <BRK> by karen crouse <BRK> ponte vedra beach  fla    at last week s arnold palmer invitational  phil mickelson carded a   in the first round while chewing gum  the next day  without gum  he sprayed his shot all over the bay hill course and shot a    <BRK> a coincidence  mickelson think not  <BRK> to boost his cognitive functioning  mickelson     started chewing gum during competition in january at the desert clasic   and tied for second  two start later  chewing gum a he walked  mickelson clinched his  th pga tour title  <BRK>  the chewing aspect stimulates the frontal cortex   said mickelson  who couldn t get his putter activated thursday in the opening round of the player championship  mickelson  the   champion  had a four putt from   foot on the par   third hole  which wa his  th of the round  for a triple bogey   on his way to a two over par    that left him nine stroke behind the leader  tommy fleetwood and keegan bradley  who each posted a    <BRK>  it didn t help much today   mickelson said with a rueful laugh  but  to the amusement of his peer  mickelson ha no plan to give up the gum  <BRK>  i ve seen him chomping on that gum  and i wa wondering what he wa doing   steve stricker said   leave it to phil  i guess  to come up with that   <BRK> there is some actual science to mickelson s assertion  study have shown that chewing gum is associated with improved alertness and the ability to process new information  though the result are far from definitive  a   study psychologist at st  lawrence university found that student who chewed gum and then discarded it performed demanding cognitive task like repeating number backward and solving complex logic puzzle better than those who did not chew gum  <BRK> mickelson s caddie and younger brother  tim  said he could not speak to the science of gum chewing  but he could vouch for mickelson s improved focus  last year  he said  mickelson on occasion would ask him to pick a club for him to hit because he couldn t gather his thought  an inability to focus hadn t been an issue this year  mickelson s brother said  <BRK> in the copycat world of professional golf  where player have turned their searching mind to mouth guard  tobacco chewing and copper bracelet a performance aid  could mickelson s success this year spawn other gum chewer  <BRK> any player tempted to make like violet beauregarde  the  charlie and the chocolate factory  character who obsessively worked the same piece of gum for month at a time  should consider themselves warned  serge onyper  who co wrote the st  lawrence university study  noted in an email on wednesday that those who chewed gum for five minute before getting rid of it benefited compared with those who did not chew gum at all  but  he wrote   those who chewed the gum throughout the cognitive task did not benefit compared to those who did not chew gum   <BRK> mickelson     said he chew two piece per round  but would not divulge the type or brand   it s not on the market yet   he said  <BRK> gum come with and without sugar  with caffeine and  now  infused with cannabidiol  or cbd  which ha been used to treat a variety of symptom  including joint inflammation  it is categorized the tour a a dietary supplement and is not prohibited  though player are advised to use extreme caution when using it and other supplement because  in general  there is no guarantee that what s on the label is what s in the product  <BRK> tiger wood noted that michael jordan chewed gum when he played basketball and said he ha chewed gum on occasion for a quick sugar boost  there have been other gum chewer in the game  notably payne stewart  a three time major winner  in the  s  the golfer hubert green bestowed upon tim norris the nickname pac man because he chomped gum the way the arcade game character gobbled ghost  <BRK> paul azinger  nbc s lead golf analyst  described norris  the   greater hartford open champion  a  the greatest gum chewer in the history of golf   a distinction that made norris chuckle when it wa recently relayed to him  <BRK> norris described his gum chewing a  a nervous habit  and said he preferred the spearmint flavor  because it wa green  and if i did accidentally drop it  it blended into the gras   <BRK> after norris left competitive golf and embarked on a college coaching career   i kind of grew out of the habit   he said  <BRK> billy horschel  the   fedex cup champion  wa forced to curb his gum habit recently when he started wearing a clear aligner on his upper teeth  horschel described his gum chewing a  kind of a superstitious thing  but said it served a purpose  <BRK>  i could chew on it harder when i needed to work out some frustration   he said thursday after signing for a    <BRK> some player never stuck with gum chewing long enough for it to become habit forming  it wa not calming for bubba watson  who said   i tried to do it to take my mind off thing going on but i bit my tongue too much   <BRK> and stricker said   i started chewing gum and all of the sudden i wa building up tension in my jaw because i started really grinding on it   <BRK> in    jordan spieth chewed gum on his way to winning the british open for his third major title  <BRK>  i did it for no intended reason   said spieth  whose swing coach  cameron mccormick  offered him a piece of gum before his opening tee shot  he got off to a quick start and just kept chomping on it until after he wa done with his post round news conference  <BRK> spieth hasn t made gum chewing a habit   but i think there s something to it   he said   i could sit here and say phil s blowing smoke but this one make sense  when you re focused on chewing  that can take your mind off of golf and can kind of calm player a bit   <BRK> if mickelson is so sold on gum s cognitive benefit  why didn t he chew his standard two piece during the second round of the arnold palmer invitational  where he ended up missing the cut  <BRK>  i forgot   he said  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
