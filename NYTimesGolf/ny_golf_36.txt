combination with upscale golf course   are hugely popular among wealthier homeowner in south africa  consistently outperforming the general market  largely because they offer a combination of amenity and  a at val de vie  state of the art security  <BRK> an analysis of the sector in   lightstone property  a local valuation firm  identified approximately     estate development across the country  these accounted for about   percent of all residential home but more than   percent of the market value  <BRK> only the united state  with a population six time a large  ha more of what are known

every day  according to the most recent police statistic  making it one of the most violent country on earth  according to the united nation  <BRK> the police recorded nearly     burglary last year  or   daily  some expert estimate that the true burglary figure is perhaps three time that high  break in and car highjacking can quickly turn almost gratuitously violent  with victim beaten and raped if they do not quickly turn over valuable or open safe  bank and high end mall are routinely patrolled guard holding automatic weapon  <BRK>  south african consistently rank crime among their top concern  second only to unemployment    said andrew faull  a senior researcher at the institute for security study  but  he added   although the middle class and wealthy south african may feel restricted fear of crime  they are sigificantly le restricted than the poor majority    <BRK> for people who can afford to move from  bubble of security to bubble of security   he said  life can be  quite easy   <BRK> it wa almost accident that mr  van der venter became converted to this way of life  <BRK> for more than a decade he had owned a sprawling property in cape town  not perturbed it long  dark driveway or ramshackle fencing  then he took a job in the east coast city of durban  moving into an estate development popular among his new colleague  <BRK> soon afterward  he said  he began feeling  mentally free   <BRK> no longer did he need to worry about locking his door at night  his wife and child could walk around the estate after dark  he became aware of a subtle fear that had pervaded his life and wa now lifting  <BRK> upon returning to cape town  he planned to move back into his old home   but now you realized you had this fear   he said   we knew we were never going back   <BRK> instead  in    he and his wife purchased property at val de vie near paarl  it is protected thermal camera    hour dog patrol and an electrified  wrought iron perimeter fence  <BRK>  safety is the main concern  of course  but you also get this incredible lifestyle   mr  van der venter said  <BRK> purchaed in   a a disused clay quarry  val de vie now ha     completed home  apartment and hotel room  a second phae of     unit is under construction  according to the marketing director  ryk neethling  vacant lot typically cost    to    per square foot  while home go for    to    per square foot  <BRK>  many resident who built in phase one have already invested in phase two   said mr  neethling  a former olympic swimming champion  on a recent tour through the development   they see the dust and construction site and know that in a few year  it will look like this   <BRK> property at val de vie range from individualized seven acre small holding   gentleman s estate   to one bedroom apartment designed one of south africa s most prominent architect  stefan antoni  most property are family home with gray roof and large window  conforming to a building code that is  flexible but ensures some consistency   mr  neethling said  <BRK> nate foster  a cellphone tower developer from boulder  colo   moved into one of these home in january  with five bedroom  large glas walled living area and a   foot swimming pool  it cost le than    million  a comparable property back home  mr  foster said  would have cost three to four time a much  <BRK> he and his wife had been  really resistant  to lifestyle estate since relocating to cape town in    mr  foster said  wanting  more of a cultural experience   but  the reality of south africa still exist   he went on   keeping one eye open all the time wasn t desirable   <BRK> there s also the convenience factor  mr  foster  a triathlete  said he can train more easily at val de vie before going to work  a new fitness center on the estate  the yard  ha an olympic size swimming pool and a gym run john mcgrath  a seven foot irishman who used to perform in strongman competition at coney island in new york  <BRK>  what s special about this place is the community   said mr  mcgrath  who stay in shape bending metal wrench into hoop  <BRK> but like mr  foster  the overwhelming majority of resident at val de vie are affluent and white  about   percent are foreigner  mostly from europe  mr  neethling said  adding that between   percent and   percent are nonwhite  <BRK> adding more affordable housing option to the estate   still beyond the reach of all but the wealthiest south african   ha helped broadened access without  contaminating  price  said mr  van der venter  in fact  the apartment  introduced in    have been among the most successful development at val de vie  with the highest average value per square foot  approximately     and investment return of   percent in just two year  <BRK>  i signed up to buy two but backed out   said mr  van der venter  who also owns an office block on the estate   you keep thinking this bubble is going to burst  now i m kicking myself   <BRK> even with south africa s weak economy having strained property price over the past decade  residential estate continued to perform well  said andrew amoils from new world wealth  <BRK> there wa  massive growth  in the sector from   to    but it slowed after the global financial crisis  mr  amoils explained  even so  he said   it still consistently outperforms the general market   <BRK> in recent year  there ha been a pronounced trend of developer  interspersing townhouse and apartment among larger house  mr  amoils said  obtaining permission to build new estate had become more difficult  particularly a concern about water use rose amid increaingly frequent drought  and rising rate and tax had made big home le affordable  <BRK> still  there wa the safety issue   people get used to living like this   mr  amoils said  <BRK> on a recent evening  a the sun set above the polo field  chad marthinussen and chanell clasen  both   year old doctor  returned to their rental apartment after work   you can come home from a crazy shift to this prettiness and just switch off   m  clasen said  <BRK> she grew up in bonteheuwel  a working class suburb outside cape town  she and mr  marthinussen are planning to marry  they both loved the estate s security and relaxed atmosphere  but they also shared some ambivalence  <BRK>  if we have kid  we don t know if we d want them growing up here   mr  marthinussen confessed   it feel like a safe bubble  and that s amazing  but the real world isn t like this   <BRK>  <BRK>
