 <BRK>  <BRK> by reuters <BRK> augusta  ga    the fifth hole at augusta national is certainly not the most famous  but this year it could be the hardest after being stretched so far that they had to reroute the road that ran behind the old tee   <BRK> the par four ha been turned into a brute  lengthened some   yard to nearly   yard  officially   though the number will change slightly each day depending on where the pin is put  <BRK> the tee will also likely be moved a few yard each day  <BRK>  i think number five is probably going to play the toughest hole now for sure   said world number one justin rose  <BRK> the hole  which curve gently to the left without being a dogleg  still ha two deep bunker guarding the left hand side  encouraging player to aim more for the right side of the fairway  <BRK> rory mcilroy  perhaps the longest hitter in the field  used to worry about his ball running through the fairway and into bush on the right  and often used a three wood off the tee for safety instead of a driver  <BRK> now he can swing away without fear  <BRK>  i think  hole  five ha been a very good change in term  that  it put driver back in a lot of guy  hand that wouldn t necessarily hit driver on that hole   said the northern irishman  <BRK>  and you need to hit driver  because i came here last wednesday  played in the morning  it wa a little cold  a little damp and i hit four iron into the green  <BRK>  if you hit three wood and you re   yard back of  where driver would stop  you re on the upslope and you can hardly see the green   <BRK> tiger wood succinctly summed up the new hole  <BRK>  it s just long   he said on wednesday   the bunker are still deep  i think they are unplayable to get the ball to the green   <BRK> the hole wa parred more than two third of the time in    when it yielded only   birdie all week  along with   bogey and four double bogey   <BRK> it wa the sixth hardest of the week  <BRK> it is likely to give up even fewer birdie this week  but a lot more bogey  <BRK>  i always like making hard hole harder   said three time master champion phil mickelson  <BRK> for the shorter hitter  the game plan ha not really changed  <BRK>  the tee shot is pretty much the same shot   said british open champion francesco molinari  who is not a particularly long hitter  <BRK>  the second shot  obviously is longer  considerably longer  yesterday it wa playing into the wind  and probably with the old tee we would have been hitting seven iron in  and we were hitting four iron in yesterday   <BRK>  i think that s going to be around a three club difference   <BRK>   reporting andrew both in cary  north carolina  editing toby davis  <BRK>  <BRK>
