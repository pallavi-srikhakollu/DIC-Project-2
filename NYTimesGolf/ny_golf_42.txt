fireplace  a bronze sculpture of bobby jones and a portrait of clifford robert  a club founder  painted president dwight d  eisenhower  who joined the club in    <BRK> the master club began the champion dinner during the   tournament when the defending champion ben hogan gave a dinner for the previous winner  hogan proposed the formation of the master club  with it membership limited to master champion  <BRK>  i wish to invite you to attend a stag dinner at the augusta national   hogan wrote in an invitation  <BRK>  my only stipulation is that you wear your green coat   <BRK> honorary membership were also extended to jones and robert  later  attendee included the club and tournament chairman bill lane  hord hardin  jack stephen  hootie johnson  billy payne and ridley  <BRK> a part of the tradition  the defending champion selects the menu and host the dinner  where player in their green jacket mingle over drink before dining  with view overlooking the back terrace  the practice putting green  the  th green and the first tee  <BRK> reed wa ready with a menu he s had in mind since he wa a teenager  <BRK>  oh  i knew that back when i wa     reed     told reporter at the player championship   it wa always a bone in rib eye  mac and cheese  creamed corn  creamed spinach  i m going to fatten those boy up a little bit  <BRK>  i could eat a rib eye steak for breakfat  lunch and dinner  and mac and cheese  same thing   he said   it wa one of those thing where it wa a pretty eay decision  it wa just kind of refine it a little bit and bring up option where if guy don t want to eat something heavy they have a lighter option a well  i really just want everyone to enjoy the night and have something good to eat  no matter what it is   <BRK> the menu did not surprise the three time master winner gary player  who is from south africa   he clearly is a meat and potato kind of guy   seems fitting a texan chose this meal   player said  <BRK> the meal choice often reveal something about the player  where they re from  what they miss and what they simply really want to eat  <BRK> past winner have selected haggis  sandy lyle      wiener schnitzel  bernhard langer      elk  mike weir      meat pie  trevor immelman      fajitas  mark o meara      paella  josé maria olazábal     and cheeseburger and fry  tiger wood      jordan spieth  a texan  did texas barbecue in    <BRK> some men are creature of habit  bubba watson served the exact same menu in   and    caesar salad  grilled chicken breast with side of green bean  mashed potato  corn  macaroni and cheese  and cornbread  <BRK>  all interesting choice that made different statement based largely on personality  geography and the message they were sending to the other champion   player said   the south african champion selected a typical braai or barbecue  for example  with some very good south african wine  the international winner love sharing their culture at the dinner  showing how the tournament ha grown globally   <BRK> player selected his menu to show respect to all player and country and to take note of how international the master ha become  <BRK> phil mickelson  an american  picked paella in    leaving some puzzled  <BRK>  i like when the guy bring their culture into the meal   said dave dibenedetto  editor in chief of garden   gun  a southern lifestyle magazine that also cover golf   i wa curious about phil s pick  but then i realized it wa in honor of seve ballesteros   <BRK> ballesteros of spain  a two time master winner  wa ill at the time and could not make the tournament that year  mickelson selected a spanish menu  including gazpacho  beef tenderloin with manchego cheese and tortilla  and spanish apple pie with ice cream  <BRK>  phil took the honor of picking his own meal and gave that honor to a friend who couldn t be there because he wa sick   dibenedetto said  <BRK> the meal are almost always prepared the staff of the club kitchen  except for vijay singh after his   win  the club permitted singh to invite chef from atlanta  who imported ingredient from thailand for chicken panang curry  sea scallop in garlic sauce and chilean sea bass with a chili glaze  served family style  after the meal  singh brought the chef to the dining room  where they received a standing ovation  <BRK>  it is always fun   player said   lot of joke  story  i used to sit next to bobby jones and cut his meat a his hand were riddled with arthritis  ben hogan hated that it had become an autograph session  <BRK>  we always joke and laugh about the different menu choice  so yes we do notice   player said   some enjoy the different dish the current champion selects  others choose to order something specific to fit their dietary need  which is understandable   <BRK> and if the night s dinner selection isn t appealing  player can always order off the menu  the turkey club is always a safe choice  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
