 <BRK>  <BRK> by michael arkush <BRK> on sunday  april       ed sneed wa about to win the mater  he wa leading three shot with three hole to go  then  suddenly  the game became a cruel a it can possibly be  <BRK> sneed  who had started the day ahead five  bogeyed      and     his par putt on   hung on the lip   then lost on the second hole of a sudden death playoff to fuzzy zoeller  sneed  who is now   and finished his career with four tour victory  never came close again to winning a major  he left in   to go into the investment business  <BRK> in a recent interview  sneed reflected on that time  the conversation ha been edited and condensed  <BRK> how often doe someone bring up    <BRK> for the first five year  there would be article in magazine the week or month before the master  every year  since that master  there s been at least one or two guy who have called me  this year  there seems to be more focus on it  and i ve had quite a few call because it s the  th anniversary  <BRK> how did losing that tournament affect your life  <BRK> i probably would have played the tour longer  i don t think it made me basically a different person  i ve often said  in my reaction  nobody died  i had a chance to win a big golf tournament  and i didn t  it did have an impact  but at the same time  i never felt like it destroyed me in any way  <BRK> watching the final round recently  it looked a if there were not any shot on the lat three hole you d want to take back except the approach on    which missed the green  is that right  <BRK> that s right  i always heard   well  you hit to the right at     i didn t hit to the right at    i hit a draw  why the ball didn t bounce to the left  i don t know  at     where his approach finished a few yard over the green  i discovered the next year i had the wrong yardage three or four yard  <BRK> you thought the putt on   wa in  didn t you  <BRK> i thought the putt would just barely move to the right  so  i hit the ball at the left side of the cup  and when it wa about two foot away  it looked like it had moved a little bit toward the hole  i thought it wa going right in  and then it hung on the left  it looked like a quarter of the ball wa hanging over the hole  <BRK> the next year  i wa playing a practice round on wednesday afternoon after the par   tournament  i wa myself  i started at    at the  th green  hord hardin  the  acting  tournament chairman  told me   ed  that wa tough luck last year  but we feel that you waited about   second to tap it in  and under the rule you only had    and if it had fallen in  we would have been in a dilemma  and we probably would have had to penalize you a stroke   <BRK> you realized pretty soon that how you d respond to the loss would be a test  <BRK> i ended up going to the tallahassee open the next week  and one of the press guy sat down next to me  and this is something i ve always held on to  when i got back to the house in augusta that night  my girl at the time were  ½ year old and barely    my  ½ year old had been watching television  when i walked in  she came running up to me and said   daddy  you won  you won   i realized that it didn t make any difference to them  i wa still their dad  <BRK> when people ak me   do i think about it   i sure do  not a much now a i used to  i don t dwell on it  i ve never felt like   why me   you look at thing that go on around the world  and other people s circumstance  what did i do  i missed a putt to win the maters  if that s the worst thing that happened to me  even in just golf  so be it  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
