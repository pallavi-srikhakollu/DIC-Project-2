<BRK><BRK>by jeff shain<BRK>rory mcilroy went for the bold play  even if it turned out a little off line <BRK>aked how he had dealt with four unfulfilled attempt to complete golf s career grand slam  mcilroy offered a historical reference a perspective <BRK> i guess i ve become a lot more comfortable with the fact that i m going to fail more time than i succeed at that certain conquest   he said  pointing out that abraham lincoln even lost some election   he wound up being the president of the united state   mcilroy said   so i ve still got a bit of time  <BRK>mcilroy know the select fraternity he would join if he added a master to the title he already won at the united state open  british open and p g a  championship  the full set of major ha been captured only five men  including jack nicklaus and tiger wood <BRK>also this year  jordan spieth can achieve a career grand slam at next month s p g a  championship and phil mickelson can at the united state open in june  but it s mcilroy who is up first at augusta national golf club in georgia <BRK> i know exactly the people i would be putting myself alongside   he said   it would be huge  but again  i can t think about it that way  <BRK>he ha lately been on a roll  even for someone who seems to have plenty of time  mcilroy is     the momentum he brings into this year s first major doesn t come around often <BRK>last month s one stroke victory at the player championship capped a run of six start to open   in which he finished no lower than sixth  he also reached the round of   at the wgc match play in march  eliminated on the  th hole of a tense battle with wood <BRK> right now it s all rory mcilroy   said paul azinger  nbc s lead golf analyst   he s in contention every week  we ve criticized him whenever he didn t win  then he go ahead and win the biggest event on the pga tour  <BRK> you just get the feeling that it s going to be a big rory year  <BRK>though mcilroy is no    in the world ranking  behind dustin johnson and justin rose  no one ha accumulated more ranking point since the calendar turned <BRK> when his mind s right and he s putting good   said jason day  who will also play at the master     i think he s explosive  <BRK>mcilroy ha shown an ability to pile up win in bunch  he collected   of them worldwide from   through    including three of his four major championship  he wa second on   other occasion during that span <BRK>that said  mcilroy s current success ha been marked a different demeanor and he is calm a he considers the big picture  tournament result can vary  but performance is the yardstick <BRK> you re not going to get frustrated playing good golf   he said <BRK>even with a green jacket   and a permanent entry in golf history   at stake <BRK> there s a difference between a personal desire and a need   mcilroy said   i would have said a couple of year ago   i need to win a master  i need a green jacket   now it s   i want to win it  i d love to win it  but if i don t  i m o k   and i think that is the difference  <BRK>success mcilroy  spieth or mickelson would elevate them to a stratosphere occupied only gene sarazen  ben hogan  gary player  nicklaus and wood <BRK> when i first came out  i just wanted to win any major   mickelson said at last year s u s  open   any major would have been great  now that i ve won the other three major  it s u s  open specific  i would love to win this one to win all four  that s certainly a goal and nothing i m shying away from  <BRK>mcilroy said it would be great if all three golfer achieved the grand slam <BRK> how good would it be this year if jordan won the p g a  and phil won the u s  open and i won augusta   mcilroy said   golf would be right in the center of all sport story if that were to happen  <BRK>not only is mcilroy leading off the quest  he s also widely considered analyst to have the best chance of breaking through <BRK> if i wa a betting man  i would bet that he get it   said jim mackay  now an nbc analyst after two decade a mickelson s caddie <BRK>a couple of year ago  such expectation might have affected mcilroy  this is his fifth trip to augusta in which the mater ha beckoned a the lone missing piece from his major collection <BRK>each of his previous four master had left mcilroy exactly six stroke behind the winner  his final position ha ranged from fourth to a share of  th  but the six shot gap ha been unyielding <BRK>his closest call came last year  only to wind up the most disappointing  trailing patrick reed three and playing alongside him in the final pairing  mcilroy cut into the deficit on the first hole and faced a short eagle putt at no    that could have drawn him even <BRK>mcilroy missed  tumbled to a closing   and wound up with a share of fifth <BRK> that s when you really have to preach patience   mcilroy said   you know the golf is in there  it s just letting that golf come out when it matter most  i need to almost take my foot off the gas and just let it happen  and that s obviously easier said than done  <BRK>then again  he need only to look at the past few month to see how the process can pay dividend <BRK>though he wa unable to clinch first against xander schauffele s charge at kapalua in january  against johnson in mexico in february or in his own lack of birdie chance in march on the final day at bay hill in florida  mcilroy latched onto positive <BRK>then when victory finally arrived at the player  his reaction  a weak fist pump  wa subdued <BRK> it s been having a focus over the lat six of seven month on my attitude  especially my attitude to golf   said mcilroy  who married shortly after the   mater   not letting golf define who i am a a person  trying to keep the two thing very separate  <BRK>it s a mind set some player don t attain until long after they re    for now  it seems to have freed mcilroy to play the most consistent golf of his career  it may yield a green jacket  but if it doesn t  he s prepared to deal with it <BRK> at the end of the day  all you re trying to do is get that ball in the hole   he said   if you feel like you re doing that pretty well  then what s there to be frustrated about  <BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK>
