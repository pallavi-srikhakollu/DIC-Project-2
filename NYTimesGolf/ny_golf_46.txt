choi  a south korean native and a regular of the japan tour  is a cross between chi chi rodriguez and fred astaire  <BRK> choi spin around on his follow through a if his club is his dance partner  his pre swing routine is also unique  resembling an oblique muscle stretch  he swivel to his left and his eye lock on his left shoulder a he hold his club high  a if to light a kerosene street lamp  he pause at the top long enough to exhale loudly  making a  shoo  sound before settling over his ball  <BRK> jordan spieth  the three time major winner and the   champion at pebble beach  had seen video of choi and wa among those eager to see him up close  <BRK>  i actually wa fascinated  clearly  his swing  and the way he move around   spieth said  adding   it s just really entertaining  i think people are really excited to see him this week   <BRK> choi     did not take up the game until he wa around the same age a the   year old spieth  but he ha developed a showman s touch  the bigger the crowd  the more he appears to play to it  upon being introduced to warm applause on the first tee  choi bowed to the fan on three side of the tee box before settling into his pre shot routine  <BRK> on a different tee  he took his driver head cover  decorated with studded star  and pretended to give a back rub to rodgers and jerry kelly  the other pro  brushing it over their sweater  later  the other amateur  the actor chris o donnell  wa teasing rodgers about his mustache  which called to mind burt reynolds s facial hair in the  s film  smokey and the bandit   rodgers looked at choi  who wa standing nearby  and choi gave him the thumb up  <BRK>  see   rodgers said   ho sung like it   <BRK> choi surprised rodgers with his english ability  after rodgers surprised choi greeting him in korean  kelly introduced himself to choi on the practice green with an outstretched hand and a wide grin   we will have so much fun   he told him  <BRK> after the round  choi broke into a broad smile of his own and said that kelly had been right  <BRK>  i think my pairing wa just a good a the weather   choi said through an interpreter  referring to the abundant sunshine and negligible breeze   and i learned a lot from jerry kelly   <BRK> choi know that he ha a lot of catching up to do  he wa training for a job in the fishing industry  he said  until he lost the tip of his right thumb in a chain saw accident at    <BRK> doctor reattached the tip  and choi redirected his focus  landing a part time job at a golf course two year later  it wa there that he honed his self taught swing  <BRK> this is his first trip to the united state  he said  and he arrived with load of enthusiasm but not a single endorsement  his black cap and turquoise sweater both featured the pebble beach golf link logo  and his caddie carried a new taylormade bag that seemed tailor made for choi  with a silhouette logo of his follow through  complete with the kick flourish  <BRK> choi said he chose his first round outfit purposefully   i wanted to show my appreciation for the tournament for having me out here   he said  adding   i m incredibly grateful  and that s why i m wearing the logo   <BRK> the group wa led jonah webster  a   year old golfer from sonora  calif   roughly   mile northeast of monterey bay  his grandfather  steve lee  who walked alongside him thursday  said webster had trembled with excitement when he found out he would be carrying the scoring sign for rodgers  one of his idol  and choi  whose swing he had watched on youtube  <BRK> lee joked that he had told his grandson to close his eye when choi took the club away  because his swing wa not exactly something that impressionable youngster should be trying   it s fun to pull for a guy who s so unique   lee said  <BRK> outside the rope  others seemed to share lee s sentiment  they cheered for every good shot and great escape orchestrated choi  who wa four over after   hole but made three birdie in the final eight to salvage a one over    at the end of the second round on friday  he wa tied for  th place at four over  <BRK>  i definitely felt the love from my fan   choi said   and i felt like that pushed me more to focus on the back nine   <BRK> choi s struggle notwithstanding  he at least impressed rodgers   he s not a sideshow   the quarterback said   he can play  and i think it s really good for golf   <BRK>  <BRK>
