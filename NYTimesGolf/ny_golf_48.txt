 <BRK>  <BRK> by karen crouse <BRK> los angeles   matt kuchar had heard enough  battered criticism that he had essentially stiffed a caddie who helped him win a tournament last november in mexico  he took action to make amends on friday  issuing a statement in which he apologized for his initial action and also said he had now paid the caddie a good deal more money  <BRK> in the   line statement  which wa released while he wa playing the rain delayed first and second round of the genesis open in los angeles  kuchar said he had now given the caddie  david giral ortiz  a much bigger sum than the      he originally paid him after capturing the first place prize of      million at the mayakoba golf classic  <BRK> in issuing the statement  kuchar clearly hoped to put an end to the bad tidings that had sullied his image and cat him a a tone deaf american with a let them eat cake attitude  <BRK>  golf is a game where we call penalty on ourselves   kuchar said in the statement   i should have done that long ago and not let this situation escalate   <BRK> the statement did not specify how much more kuchar had sent ortiz s way  but it appears an additional      wa paid out  <BRK> ortiz had been asking for a total of       according to marc graubart  a houston businessman working on the caddie s behalf  and kuchar  in his statement  said ortiz had now been paid what he wa seeking  <BRK> kuchar s apology came at the end of a trying week for him  and after a challenging first round on friday at the riviera country club  where he heard the usual genial chant of  kooooch  from some of his fan but also a number of barb from others about his perceived parsimony  <BRK> kuchar     ha earned more than    million a a professional golfer  but his problem began when he won a tournament in playa del carmen  mexico  that he had baically entered on a whim  <BRK> in a typical pga tour arrangement  a caddie receives a flat rate of      for a tournament  which help cover expense  and a bonus worth   percent of the golfer s winning  for ortiz  a local caddie who is also known a el tucan  that would have amounted to about       <BRK> instead  ortiz told michael bamberger of golf com  he and kuchar had agreed on a      payment plus an unspecified amount of whatever money kuchar won at the tournament  <BRK> kuchar  meanwhile  said he had promised ortiz      if he missed the cut       if he made the cut       for a top   finish and      for a top   finish  with no specification for how much more he would pay ortiz if he finished first  <BRK> which kuchar proceeded to do  ending a four year winless drought  at that point  kuchar gave ortiz        the      he said they had agreed upon for the top   finish and a      bonus  kuchar confirmed that total to golf com and added   for a guy who make    a day  a      week is a really big week   <BRK> but the tone and content of that comment were quickly pounced on  particularly people from outside the insular world of golf  and some golf fan weren t too pleaed kuchar s attitude  either  a kuchar walked down the first fairway on friday morning  one fan stopped walking and shouted in kuchar s direction   frugal  just frugal    the fan yelled   i pay my caddie more   <BRK> the fan  brent wei  who described himself a a kindergarten teacher  said kuchar had been his favorite player  but not anymore  <BRK>  how do you tip a caddie      when you ve made      million   wei said   to me  i think that s called discrimination   <BRK> wei added   i can t even look at the guy   <BRK> not surprisingly  kuchar also found himself the target of increasing indignation on social medium  <BRK> in his statement on friday  kuchar  who is considered one of the more affable player on the tour  said he viewed his initial comment in defense of the      payment a  out of touch and insensitive   <BRK>  they made it seem like i wa marginalizing david ortiz and his financial situation  which wa not my intention    the statement added   i read them again and cringed  that is not who i am and not what i want to represent   <BRK> kuchar declined to comment a he walked off the course on friday  when play wa halted for the day  he still had five hole to complete in the second round  <BRK> a nine time tour winner  kuchar serf a a brand spokesman for several company  including skechers shoe  bridgestone golf and royal bank of canada  before turning professional in    kuchar  who had starred at georgia tech  worked for a year a an investment banker  <BRK> ortiz  a father of two  life in a rented house and take the bus to his job at the golf course  and the fact that he wa paid only      kuchar might not have become a widely known a it did were it not for the effort of graubart  who regularly employ ortiz during golf vacation in mexico  <BRK> in a telephone interview on thursday  graubart said he happened to be with ortiz in mexico last month when question about how much kuchar had paid him surfaced  they saw kuchar on television during a tournament in hawaii  telling reporter that he had paid ortiz more than      for his service but le than   percent of his total earnings  <BRK> graubart said he then quizzed ortiz about the detail of his unwritten agreement with kuchar  at which point  graubart said  he explained the typical pay scale to ortiz  who seemed unaware that he could have earned more money  <BRK> graubart said he and a friend helped ortiz write email to kuchar s agent  mark steinberg  requesting more compensation  in a jan    email  which the new york time obtained  ortiz wrote that he had asked kuchar for a percentage of his first place check if he were to win  the existence of the email wa first reported golf com  <BRK>  matt said  sure  with a smile   ortiz wrote in the email   not believing that he would actually win the tournament   <BRK> a few day later  graubart said  ortiz received an offer of      from a tournament director who appeared to be acting on behalf of kuchar s agent  but graubart said ortiz had requested       and the caddie then wrote an email asking if he could deal directly with steinberg  who replied   i am out of the country  what matt ha offered is fair   <BRK> some golf fan clearly disagreed  a gofundme account had been set up on ortiz s behalf and late on thursday night  the total had reached       <BRK> but kuchar had a significant change of heart  and now ortiz ha a lot more than that in his bank account  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
