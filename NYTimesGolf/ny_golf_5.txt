 <BRK>  <BRK> by shivani vora <BRK> it is a buyer s market for consumer interested in buying property in a golf community  whether a hotel resort with residence or a residential only development  <BRK> gregory nathan  the chief business officer for the national golf foundation  a golf market research provider  said that a building boom from   to   produced a flood of home at top quality golf course  mostly in the united state but internationally  too  <BRK>  there is still plenty of supply to spare  and the competition among golf community to woo buyer is fierce   he said  <BRK> while interest in golf community home waned after the   recession  that is no longer the case  said gregory daco  the chief united state economist for oxford economics usa  <BRK>  the global economy is stronger  and people have more disposable income to spare  which mean that they re more apt to invest in secondary purchase like golf home   he said  <BRK> but before buyer decide to live in such a community  they should consider several factor  here is advice on how to make an informed decision about buying a golf home  <BRK>  <BRK> it s all about the location <BRK> first and foremost  even before looking at prospective property  consider the destination  <BRK>  you should like the idea of living where you re looking   said patrick melton  a co founder and managing partner of south street partner  a private equity real estate investment firm based in charlotte  n c   and charleston  s c  the firm owns kiawah island club  a golf community near charleston with residence and two golf course  <BRK> if you ve spent time in and enjoy miami or spain s costa del sol region  both of which have an abundance of golf community  for example  seek out home in these area  on the flip side  if you re enamored of countryside golf community but don t particularly like being in remote setting  look for a site that s in a suburb and close to a city  <BRK> many consumer fall in love with a golf community and buy a home there  mr  melton said  only to realize afterward that they re not thrilled with the area  <BRK> also  consider whether being near quality medical care  an international airport  noteworthy restaurant and an art and culture scene is a priority  <BRK>  your home could tick all the box in term of what you re looking for  but it may be an hour s drive to a major grocery store or hospital  which could be a hassle   mr  melton said  <BRK> and don t forget about the weather  some destination are too cold to play golf or spend time outdoors in winter or may have a rainy or hurricane season  while others are almost too hot in summer  said liz rowlinson  editor of a place in the sun magazine  a division of the british based real estate consulting brand of the same name  <BRK>  if you want to play golf year round and want a home that s appealing to be in year round  you should look for a property located in a region with a stable climate  save for maybe a few month   she said  <BRK> but location also mean the exact position of your home  m  rowlinson said  <BRK>  living right next to a green or fairway sound idyllic but early morning mower can be noisy  sprinkler come on during the night  and fast moving golf ball landing in your pool is tiresome   she said  <BRK> the bottom line is that if you re sensitive to noise  the crack of tee shot drive is far louder than the murmur of greenside putt  <BRK> similarly  you may like view across fairway  but will you be happy with golfer staring into your home a they pas  a strategically placed line of bush can provide privacy  <BRK> if you re an avid golfer  the number of other good course nearby should figure in  too  playing at your own club week after week may get dull  <BRK>  ideally  you d want at least a few public course le than an hour s drive from you  so you have the option for some variety when you play   m  rowlinson said  <BRK>  <BRK> find an experienced broker <BRK> more often than not  buyer interested in golf community usually don t work with broker who are well informed about the area they re looking in  said blake plumley  the chief executive of capital pursuit  a development consulting firm specializing in resort residential community  when interviewing potential broker  ask them how many property they have sold in the community  ideally  it should be several  <BRK> also  inquire about three positive aspect and three drawback of living in those community   your broker should be able to easily answer this   mr  plumley said  <BRK> the broker should personally know the golf club s membership director  the general manager  the head golf pro and a few other key figure in the community   you want a broker who can directly introduce you to these people   mr  plumley said  <BRK>  <BRK> look for key amenity <BRK> successful golf community offer much more than golf   so much that they most likely attract plenty of nongolfing resident  m  rowlinson said  <BRK> desirable amenity include a clubhouse with more than one social gathering space  tennis court  an outdoor pool with a grill area  a high quality restaurant  a caual dining option and a bar  a family friendly club is also important  the best community have a robust lineup of activity for child and family  such a summer camp  boating and hiking excursion  pool day  fun food themed dinner such a taco night and more  <BRK>  the more amenity a community ha  the broader it appeal is  making your home more sellable if you ever look to move   mr  melton said  <BRK>  <BRK> understand financial commitment <BRK> living in a golf development come with additional cost that could include club due  property tax and monthly maintenance fee  these cost can vary greatly from one community to the next  and while the home you are considering might be affordable  the price of living in the community could be exorbitant  <BRK> also  some community as their resident  while others don t  that mean that resident are billed for the cost of project such a a new health club or repairing the clubhouse s leaky roof  financially sound community have a healthy cah reserve to pay for such project  the exact number varies  depending on a community s size and the scale of it amenity   but according to mr  plumley  some community have no or limited money in reserve  your broker will be able to give you that information  <BRK>  be careful what you sign up for  because you could unexpectedly be out a few thousand dollar at any given time   he said  <BRK> are you willing to play by the rule  <BRK> all golf community have regulation that resident are expected to follow  mr  melton said that buyer should be sure to understand what these rule are and decide whether they re comfortable abiding them  <BRK> one of the more significant rule is whether all resident are required to be member of the golf club  whether you re a golfer or not  it may be a smarter move to live in a community where you re not required to be a member  otherwise  when you look to resell  a potential buyer base will be more limited  <BRK> and if you are interested in becoming a member  know what you are signing up for  if you ever move and need to give up your membership  for example  you may be required to pay due until someone can take it over  which could take a few year  <BRK>  i know of instance where member have had to pay due for five year after they ve moved away   mr  melton said  <BRK> also  most community have design guideline  and you want to make sure that the aesthetic match yours  for example  you most likely won t be allowed to build an art deco home in a community where all the property are built in a contemporary style  <BRK>  <BRK> ask if the golf course is protected <BRK> is there a chance of your community s golf course closing so that home or other structure can be built  <BRK> ask your real estate agent to find out  in some case  a golf course is protected it owner through a conservation easement or deed restriction stating that the land can never be anything but a course  but some course are not protected  which mean that the owner have the right to close them  <BRK>  i wouldn t buy in community where the golf course isn t protected because your property ha the potential to lose   percent or more of it value   mr  plumley said  <BRK>  <BRK> plan to hang out for a while <BRK> it s vital to spend a few day actually living at a community you are interested in  mr  plumley said  <BRK>  you want to make sure that you re comfortable and like being surrounded the people who will be your neighbor   he said  <BRK> most community offer discounted stay for serious buyer  who should take up the offer and play the golf course  use the pool and dine in the restaurant  <BRK> while you re there  be sure to interact with the staff a much a possible  mr  melton said  <BRK>  in good golf community  many of the employee have been around for decade  and you should definitely like them  because they re the one who are going to be helping you   he said  <BRK>  <BRK>
