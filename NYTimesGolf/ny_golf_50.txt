 <BRK>  <BRK> by karen crouse <BRK> austin  tex    rory mcilroy never trailed in his first three match at austin country club  advancing to the round of   at the world golf championship match play event without having to play the  th or  th hole  he wa looking to extend his front running way in an elimination match against tiger wood  whose superlative career ha been a sucker pin that mcilroy recently decided to stop taking dogged aim at  <BRK> mcilroy     ha   pga tour title  including four major  which make him the leader of the men s   something set but far behind a pre   year old wood s pace of   pga tour title  including   major  <BRK> mcilroy came into this week a perhaps the hottest player in the men s game  with six top six finish in his first six start in    including a victory at the player championship  but unlike wood  whose stated goal when he wa mcilroy s age wa to win every time he played  mcilroy spoke earlier in the week of the likelihood that he would fail since he win le than   percent of his start  with odds like that  mcilroy ha learned to meaure success in other way  like framing the struggle a growth opportunity and accentuating the positive  <BRK> mcilroy had never faced wood     in match play  and he clearly had no idea how quickly the condition could change from warm to chilly  there wa the rain and wind that blew in on the back nine  which wa forecast  but mcilroy ought to also have been prepared to face an opponent  in wood  who wa a dispassionate adversary intent on making putt  not conversation  <BRK> mcilroy s easy familiarity is with wood  the friend and mentor  he sometimes practice with wood  his south florida neighbor  and he and his family regularly dine at the restaurant that wood owns  mcilroy s last two major victory came in    the year of wood s worsening back problem  which led to four operation and two essentially lost season  <BRK> so a mcilroy s stature wa growing  he got only glimpse of wood  the foe and mentalist whose competitive fire often reduced his would be rival to ah  <BRK> on saturday  a sizable congregation of early rising wood worshiper watched a match of dueling personality   wood s intensity versus mcilroy s inclusivity  in the end  the edge belonged to wood  whose   and   victory slowed mcilroy s momentum a he roll into augusta for the maters in two week  <BRK> in the afternoon quarterfinal  luca bjerregaard sent wood packing with a   up defeat  which wood described a a snag in his pre maters preparation   i wa really hoping to play sunday   he said  referring to the semifinal and final  <BRK> wood s match against mcilroy  which ended when wood drained a   foot par putt to halve the par    th hole  began to turn on the par   fifth when mcilroy had an   foot birdie putt to go   up  he backed away from the attempt and waited for more than a minute while the player on an adjacent fairway hit their shot  the pause gave mcilroy plenty of time to think about the putt  which he then missed  <BRK> funnily enough  mcilroy might have been one of the few people at the hole who wa aware that there were others in action  this wa wood s first appearance a a professional in austin  and fan flocked to watch him play a if he may never again come their way  <BRK> mcilroy tried to draw wood into casual conversation early in the match only to have his attempt peter out like short putt  they did not talk during a lengthy delay on the fifth tee while they waited for the fairway to clear  mcilroy idly bounced a ball several time on the face of his driver  wood took his ball  placed it between his right index and middle finger and flipped it in the air and caught it between the same two finger  a sequence he repeated several time  <BRK> mcilroy missed a   footer to lose the  th hole  extending wood s lead to   up  but a the weather turned  so  too  did the momentum  a the wind began to whip and a cold rain started to fall  mcilroy won the  th and  th hole with his first birdie of the day  the match looked a if it might be getting away from wood when he hit his drive at the par    th way left  where water lurked  but his ball bounced off someone or something and came to rest in gras trampled down fan  after a great third shot  wood sank a nervy   footer to match mcilroy s par  <BRK> if wood s putter hurt mcilroy s comeback hope  the final blow wa self inflicted  on the par    th  mcilroy s drive traveled   yard  he wa in the fairway    yard from the pin  and somehow made what amounted to a   on the hole  with wood on the green in three  mcilroy produced his worst swing of the day  the ball landed in the rough near the lip of a greenside bunker  and he pitched his next shot over the green a fan in the vicinity scattered  <BRK> the ball came to rest against a wooden bulkhead  and mcilroy took an unplayable lie  leading to wood winning the hole without having to hit a putt  mcilroy wa muttering to himself a he walked to the  th tee  but after wood ended the match on the  th green  mcilroy had nothing to say  <BRK> he hopped into a cart and left the ground without talking to reporter  it wa a rare fit of pique from mcilroy  who ha worked hard over the past year to moderate his emotion no matter what score he card  <BRK> had mcilroy learned from his loss to wood that constraint can feed a competitor s fire  it would appear not  in an instagram post later in the day  mcilroy apologized for his abrupt departure and added that he would  learn and move on   <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
