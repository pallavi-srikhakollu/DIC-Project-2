<BRK><BRK>by the associated press<BRK>augusta  ga    valentino dixon s introduction to golf came when the warden dropped his   by   cell at attica correctional facility in new york with a photo of the iconic  th hole at augusta national and a simple request <BRK>could dixon draw the hole with his colored pencil <BRK>the warden knew dixon had the talent  he certainly had the time <BRK> i hadn t heard of the  th hole  let alone augusta national   dixon said   nothing about golf  never paid a second of time to golf  it wa always football or basketball where i come from  <BRK>dixon didn t want to disappoint the warden while serving   year to life after being convicted of killing a man at a street party in his hometown of buffalo in    the warden  after all  held great sway over his living condition in one of the nation s most notorious   and dangerous   prison <BRK>but the last thing he wanted to do wa irritate his fellow inmate <BRK> they might take my credibility card away  they may say he s drawing golf course  what s going on here   dixon said   you don t want people to think  hey  he s too close with the administration and this prison  <BRK>so dixon set about drawing  some time that went on for   hour  with dixon finding solace drawing the color of the grass against the brilliantly white sand and blue sky  <BRK>the warden loved the image  though that s hardly where this story end  dixon made more golf course drawing  hundred of them from picture he saw in golf digest and other magazine <BRK>it wasn t long before they found other eye <BRK>in their reflection  he found support and more believer in his innocence   his conviction wa vacated last september  but not before he had spent   year in prison <BRK>this week  dixon found himself in a place far removed from his former home   he wa at augusta national for the master  it wa both eerily familiar and strikingly foreign to him <BRK>he walked down to amen corner and saw the  th hole he knew only from picture  he met tiger wood and jack nicklaus  whom he d only seen in magazine <BRK>it felt like home  the drawing had taken him here day after endless day  when there seemed no end in sight and no reason for hope <BRK> i just wanted to cry   dixon said   i mean inside i wa cry but i held back the tear  you know  because it s just so much more remarkable and awesome in person  and i ve drawn that  th hole about eight or nine time and it s nothing like seeing it in person   nothing  it s just like the most wonderful thing that i can see in the world right now  <BRK>after spending more than half his life in prison  dixon might still be there if not for his art  he might be protesting his innocence  too  if not for a golf digest writer who answered his letter in   a a submission to a monthly narrative called  how golf saved my life  <BRK> golf is saving my life right now because i had almost   year then and i wa on borrowed time myself   dixon said   i didn t know if i wa going to live one day to see it to the next  <BRK>some of his friend in attica didn t  they took their own life <BRK> i made sure that i kept my sanity   he said   you know people lose their way  <BRK>golf digest s max adler set the wheel of justice in motion when he replied to dixon s letter  seven more year passed before he wa finally free <BRK> i wa actually an art major in college  so it s like this is golf and art and the human condition all coming together   adler said   i m of course skeptical that this guy is wrongfully convicted  but the fact that art wa sort of a redemptive force for him  i thought i d like to know more about that  <BRK>adler visited dixon inside attica  and saw his colored pencil ground down to the nub  his daughter valentina s effort gathered more momentum a  first  two attorney got involved and then even more when student from georgetown university s prison reform project took up the cause  the final piece of the puzzle fell into place when a new prosecutor took over in erie county and reviewed the cae <BRK>another man already incarcerated pleaded guilty to the murder <BRK> twenty seven year  it s just a miracle   adler said   and it s a miracle that we ever even heard from him  <BRK>dixon walked out of prison on a day filled with bright sunshine  eager to rejoin the free world  he had to learn how to use a cellphone and adjust to modern life after a generation behind bar  now he give inspirational speech and show his work in a gallery  most recently in new york <BRK>dixon say he s not bitter  his mother  though  still bristle when the subject of his incarceration come up  he wa imprisoned on her birthday  and she refused to celebrate any of them for the next   year <BRK>dixon and adler came to the mater to complete their journey in the place it
