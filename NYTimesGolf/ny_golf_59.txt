nytimes com  <BRK> ___ <BRK> briony lyle laugh when she think about it now  but in the day after her husband  jarrod  died following a lengthy battle with leukemia  she wondered what she would do with herself  for nearly a decade  her day had revolved around jarrod s schedule  first a a professional golfer and  later a a second and third time cancer patient  <BRK> jarrod s death last august at age   unleashed a global outpouring of emotion and support from people whose life he touched or who were touched the story of a seemingly regular bloke who had absorbed life s   and golf s   bad break with grit and good cheer  <BRK> at the time i marveled at how a group of athlete who tend to measure success so rigidly  who generally buy into the belief that they are what their score say they are  rallied to give a farewell befitting a giant to jarrod  a journeyman whose highest finish in   p g a  tour start wa a tie for fourth  <BRK> curious to know what life wa like for briony after the elegy stopped  i followed the australia day migration of beachgoers to torquay  the gateway to the great ocean road  where briony and jarrod moved in   and where  she said  jarrod peacefully passed his final day  <BRK> the half year anniversary of jarrod s death wa upon her  but that s not why briony saw reminder of her husband everywhere  <BRK> the day before  an american  bryson dechambeau  had claimed a seven stroke victory at the dubai desert classic  a european tour event  briony ha never met the   year old dechambeau  but at the p g a  championship  held the week after jarrod s death  dechambeau won a long driving contest and donated the      winner s check to an education fund set up for the lyles s young daughter  lusi     and jemma     <BRK> since then  briony  who never really cared for golf  ha been a huge fan of dechambeau  she recently sent him a thank you note  which began the same a hundred of others that she had written over the pat few month   we may never meet  but what you did wa so amazing  just to say thank you is not enough   <BRK> this week in the united state  the p g a  tour is outside phoenix  for a tournament known for it party atmosphere  huge crowd and stadium style  th hole  <BRK> the par   ha been the scene of nine ace  including one tiger wood and another jarrod in what wa perhaps the signature moment of his p g a  tour career  <BRK> it happened during the second round of the   event  and jarrod s reaction wa almost a memorable a a result  while the shot wa airborne  he made the motion to sit with both hand a if his golf ball were a puppy at obedience school  after the ball bounced on the green and rolled in the cup  he pumped his arm multiple time  then windmilled his arm to churn the already raucous crowd of more than     into even more of a lather  <BRK> smiling ear to ear  he ran over to his caddie shouting   you beauty   only  in typical jarrod fashion  with an expletive added for emphasis  <BRK> briony said jarrod replayed the video of the shot and his reaction hundred of time over the year  <BRK>  he d tell people not to believe all the view it ha gotten because he s been responsible for most of them   she said   people thought he wa just being humble  but he wa telling the truth   <BRK> she laughed  <BRK>  he watched that video all the time  i can remember waking up to him giggling and i d ask him what he wa laughing at and he d say   i just watched the hole in one again    <BRK> golf did not captivate briony  who wa a high school classmate of jarrod s in their hometown  shepparton  in northern victoria  when they started dating a few year later  she attended his tournament but recognized early on that she wa going to need a diversion  <BRK>  i couldn t possibly spend my time walking aimlessly around golf course pretending i wa invested in every shot and every moment   said briony  who enrolled in class in melbourne to become a massage therapist  she accumulated her required
