to come back like this it is probably one of the biggest win i ve ever had for sure because of it   <BRK> all eye were on overnight leader francesco molinari  who led two shot  wood and the weather when play began on sunday a the race for the green jacket turned into a final sprint with the forecat predicting rain and thunderstorm  <BRK> in a desperate attempt to get the season s first major across the finish line before the storm hit  official pushed up start time and sent golfer off in threesome from both the first and  th tee  <BRK> paired together in the final round of last year s british open  won the italian at carnoustie  molinari and wood found themselves in the last group again battling for a major title  <BRK> at carnoustie it wa wood who stumbled on the back nine while leading  but on sunday it wa molinari who slipped up  with the   year old from turin finding the water at the  th and  th  the two double bogey ended his green jacket bid  <BRK> molinari wa far from the only contender to meet their demise at the  th  augusta national s signature hole at the heart of amen corner had the leaderboard spinning with koepka  tony finau and ian poulter all ending up in the murky water of rae s creek  <BRK>  sometimes it is your day  sometimes it isn t  but i m really happy of the way i felt out there today   said molinari   i ve done a couple of thing that i wish i had done differently now but i ll learn from my mistake   <BRK>   editing pritha sarkar  <BRK>  <BRK>
