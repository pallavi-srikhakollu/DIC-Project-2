 <BRK>  <BRK> by the associated press <BRK> augusta  ga    the name on top of the leaderboard on a steamy thursday afternoon wa a familiar a the shout of encouragement that followed tiger wood everywhere he went in the opening round of the maters  <BRK> for a little while  at least  it wa beginning to look like old time again at augusta national  <BRK> the booming drive seemed the same on a day when the ball wa carrying far for everyone  the putting stroke wa good enough  especially on the  th hole when wood drained a putt from across the hilly green for an improbable birdie  <BRK> and perhaps the most important thing  the confidence seemed back  even if wood didn t quite get his history right after a   under   left him four shot off the lead after the first round  <BRK>  it s not a bad start   wood said   i ve only shot like under   one time  in the opening round   but i ve shot   the four time that i have won here   <BRK> it wa three  actually  since wood opened with a   in   before roaring back to win in a playoff with chris dimarco  hard to imagine then  but that s the last time anyone wa sizing wood up for a green jacket  <BRK> wood didn t get much else wrong on a day where birdie were plentiful but swirling wind kept score from trending too low  it wa the kind of day that called for course management  and wood know more than most in the field how to take on augusta national after playing   time previously in the master  <BRK> about the only thing wood couldn t manage wa the traffic jam coming off the  th green  where he crossed ahead of phil mickelson a he wa heading toward the  th tee amid a noisy mas of sweltering maters patron  <BRK> if the start wa decent  it wan t great  wood wan t even the best player this day in his threesome  a jon rahm finished off a   to edge him a shot  <BRK> and  of course  brook koepka and bryson dechambeau loom large four shot ahead after opening  s  <BRK> but decent in the opening round wa good enough to win three of his green jacket  and wood seemed to like the symmetry of this    even if it came because he bogeyed the  th hole after hitting his tee shot into the tree  <BRK>  we still have a long way to go   he said   tee off late tomorrow and the wind s supposed to be up  so i have my work cut out for me the rest of the week and so doe everyone else   <BRK> wood wa actually tied for the lead for the better part of an hour  the first time since the final round in   that his name ha been atop the gleaming white master leaderboards  his bogey on   dropped him back  but at   under he s in the middle of a large pack of player chaing the leader  <BRK> whether he can stay there depends a much on his mindset a his putting stroke  wood proved he can win again after roaring to victory in the tour championship lat year  but winning the major is always more difficult  his track record since his win at the u s  open   year ago is not a good one  <BRK> he s   now  an age where the   footer that were once automatic don t always go in  indeed  wood missed makeable putt on no    and   before steadying himself on the green the rest of the way  <BRK> and if he needed any inspiration  he seemed to get it in bernhard langer shooting a   under   at the age of    <BRK>  there s a   year old up there on that board  he know how to play this golf course   wood said   so it s a matter of missing the golf ball in the correct spot and picking your spot and when to be aggressive   <BRK> tiger fan can take hope in wood  declaration that his body feel good and so doe his game  but he s playing against guy little more than half his age who don t have bad back  <BRK> how far wood ha come in just a short time became apparent when wood revealed on the eve of the tournament that he took a nerve block just to be able to get to the champion s dinner here in    <BRK>  i ended up going to england that night  saw a specialist there   and  they recommended unfortunately for me the only way to get rid of the pain i wa living in wa to have the spinal fusion surgery   wood said at the golf writer of america annual dinner  <BRK> the surgery wa successful and now he s in the midst of a remarkable comeback that even ha his detractor beginning to cheer for him  he s also shown a more human side that make him even more endearing to golf fan  <BRK> the scene at the tour championship showed that a he wa enveloped fan swarming onto the  th hole to witness a slice of history  <BRK> who know  come sunday thing could really look familiar if tigermania break out once again  <BRK> ___ <BRK>  <BRK>
