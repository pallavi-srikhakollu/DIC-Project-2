<BRK><BRK>by the associated press<BRK>augusta  ga    in his   year at the mater  in his two decade a a pro  zach johnson had never experienced a shot like this <BRK>he had never hit one that short  either  but at least it didn t count <BRK>johnson wa going through his practice routine on the par    th on friday when the tip of his driver hit the golf ball  it went straight right into the tee marker  and then ricocheted to the left about   yard away <BRK>johnson wa so stunned he blurted out   oh   s      before turning to his group to figure out his next move  matt kuchar  ian poulter and the caddy replied in unison that the shot wan t intentional and there wa no penalty <BRK> i thought i had done it all   johnson said   but now i know i ve done it all      i don t think i could do it again if i tried  <BRK>that he wasn t trying to hit the shot is what kept him from the penalty  a decision in place even before the new rule of golf this year  it s covered under rule    b    on starting a hole   if a teed ball fall off the tee or is knocked off the tee the player before the player ha made a stroke at it  it may be re teed anywhere in the teeing area without penalty  <BRK>johnson said he knew the rule  his reaction wa  only because i have never done that  <BRK>the rest of the group apparently hadn t either because they couldn t stifle their laughter <BRK> y all can laugh   johnson said a he prepared to hit again   that is embarrasing  <BRK>johnson drilled his tee shot and wound up making birdie on his way to a   <BRK>missing the cut<BRK>two year ago  justin rose and sergio garcia faced off in a playoff for the green jacket <BRK>on friday  both were heading home <BRK>rose and garcia missed the cut a single shot  each carding a   over   for the first two round at augusta national <BRK>rose s performance wa especially disappointing  since he entered the mater a the world s top ranked player <BRK>martin kaymer wa the last no    player to miss the master cut in   <BRK>also sent home  paul casey  who stumbled to a   over   just three week after winning the valspar championship near tampa  florida <BRK>amateur hour<BRK>four amateur advanced to the weekend  the most to make the master cut in two decade <BRK>at the midway point  viktor hovland of norway wa the top amateur at   under    while alvaro ortiz of mexico      devon bling of the united state     and japan s takumi kanaya     also earned two more round at the year s first major <BRK>american kevin o connell     wa among those who missed the cut a single stroke  also failing to advance wa south africa s jovan rebula     <BRK>in    amateur sergio garcia  tom mcknight  matt kuchar and trevor immelman survived the cut <BRK> so sad to go <BRK>ian woosnam played one final round a a competitor friday  walking off the augusta national course that yielded his only major championship nearly three decade earlier  woosnam     missed the cut after round of     <BRK>he said a bad back and struggle coping with the hilly terrain confirmed a decision he wrestled with a few year ago <BRK> this is the last one  so sad to go   woosnam said   i determined it a couple of year ago and got a telling off from my wife  she said   get out there and do it again       but it doesn t seem to get any better any time i come back  <BRK>a moment later  woosnam added   maybe if they will give me a cart or something like that  i ll come back      but i don t think i ll get that  <BRK>his victory in   marked the first time a world no    ranked player won the master  what he remembered most vividly about that win wa   knowing that this is my opportunity and i took that opportunity  that wa it  <BRK>the welshman also said he d be back to play in the par   contest   be part of it  get my green jacket on  float around and enjoy it  you know  <BRK>spieth recovery<BRK>the first order of business for jordan spieth at the master wa to make sure he had a tee time on the weekend  he wa tied for  rd after opening with a    and it s probably a good thing he didn t bother inquiring caddie michael greller about the cut line early in the round <BRK> i thought it wa   and tie     because i ve never been anywhere near it   said spieth  who ha never finished worse than a tie for  th in his five master appearance   michael told me     it must have been on   or   and i m like   it s   off the lead and    right   he go   no  it s     good thing i didn t probably know that  <BRK>there wa a dicey moment early when spieth had to make an   foot putt on the first hole just to make bogey  that wa his last mistake  spieth ran off four birdie in a six hole stretch in the middle of his round for a   and at least wa still in the game <BRK> i feel really good about today s round and what you re saying a far a some momentum going forward   spieth said  who wa six shot behind when he finished   if i can somehow cut it to three sunday  then i feel like i have a legitimate chance  <BRK>spieth wa nine shot behind going into the last round at the master last year and shot   with a bogey on the last hole to finish two behind <BRK>master mystery<BRK>science didn t save bryson dechambeau at augusta national on friday <BRK>he wa leading the master at   under par when he wa mystified a shot that went over the green on the ninth hole  leading to bogey <BRK> i think what happened there wa that i didn t catch the proper spin rate   dechambeau said   i caught a lower spin rate with a lower trajectory and it jut flew right over the green and jut kept ascending  clearly the wind mut have shifted jut a little bit off of the right and not into u  and i drew it with the wind and it actually helped it     and then i had a lower spin rate and it jut said   see ya later   <BRK>the double bogey on the  th wa easier to explain <BRK> i had a mud ball in the middle of the fairway  and i tried to cut it up the slope and it just hooked on me   he said <BRK>a for the chip over the green <BRK> hit a little   yard shot relative to what i do on the range all day long  accounting for a         degree upslope     and it come out  it shoot over the green like   yard  i don t get it  so that s the game  that s golf  and that s why i love it  but i also hate it at the same time  <BRK>he shot   and wound up at   under    but the simple form of math still applies <BRK>he wa four shot behind  still very much in the game <BRK> not terrible   dechambeau said   but surely  i could be   under right now  <BRK>___<BRK>ap sport writer jim litke contributed to this report
