 <BRK>  <BRK> by ben rothenberg <BRK> melbourne  australia   a the tennis world wa transfixed on andy murray  a he played what may have been the final match of his career lat monday night  another drama wa beginning in interview room   at the australian open  <BRK> after a first round loss  australia s bernard tomic launched the opening volley in an off court rift between lleyton hewitt and some of the top male player in australian tennis  a conflict that kept head turning and eye rolling throughout the tournament s first week  <BRK>  i m going to say it honestly  no one like him anymore   tomic said of hewitt  the country s most successful men s player in the past   year and the current davis cup captain  <BRK> australian men s tennis wa a dominant force in the sport in the  s and  s  producing player who won   of the   grand slam single title in that span  hewitt arrived on the scene many year later and in the early  s  finished two season at no    and captured two grand slam title  <BRK> but ever since hewitt fell out of the top tier in    australia ha not had a male grand slam single champion or a top   men s player  instead  men s tennis in the country ha now become a soap opera  more memorable for it spat than it result on the court  <BRK> at this open  every australian man fell out of the tournament after just six day  it meant that the host country had failed to have a representative in the second week of men s single for the eighth time in the past   year  meanwhile  an australian woman   th seeded ashleigh barty  play on into the quarterfinal  her mellow and modest manner perhaps making up for the men s maddening mayhem  <BRK> and a lot of that mayhem ha to do with hewitt  who retired with considerable fanfare at the   australian open and segued into a new role a the davis cup captain  but his debut in that role wa dominated infighting  with tomic  in a midmatch rant to hewitt  accusing his teammate nick kyrgios of faking an illness  hewitt  in turn  failed to quell tomic s ire  <BRK> lat monday  tomic accused hewitt of a litany of misdeed a davis cup captain  including giving preferential treatment to player with whom he had management deal and continuing to play double tournament and in the davis cup a well  <BRK> tomic said he and others did not want to play davis cup anymore because hewitt  ha ruined the system   <BRK>  go away   he added   literally  if he is retired  why is he still in tennis  why do you play these double tournament   <BRK> hewitt entered the men s double event in brisbane  sydney and the australian open this month  <BRK> rather than defuse the flame  hewitt fanned them in his own extraordinary news conference after his loss in melbourne on thursday night  he accused tomic of unspecified threat and  blackmail  against him and his family  essentially giving up any hope of working with tomic again  <BRK>  we re trying to set cultural standard for the davis cup and representing australia  he hasn t really been close to those in the last couple of year   hewitt said  <BRK> hewitt said that tomic  won t play davis cup while i have anything to do with it   but that his relationship with kyrgios  another controversy prone australian  wa  salvageable   <BRK>  all i want guy to do is to commit to the sport and work hard  to want to play for australia   hewitt said   i don t think that s too much to ask   <BRK> tomic     and kyrgios     were junior grand slam champion and undeniable talent whose professional career have been a mix of bright spot and bad moment  with both player seeming to relish the chance to challenge the idealistic australian notion a to how a sportsman should conduct himself  <BRK> kyrgios  who also lost in the first round of this tournament  mostly mocked the question he received about tomic and hewitt in his post match news conference last tuesday  he did not pick a side  <BRK> but it wa clear kyrgios also had soured on hewitt after he posted a picture on instagram on wednesday of hewitt watching alex de minaur  the recent sydney champion who ha become his protégé  and implying that hewitt would not be watching any other australian player  <BRK> hewitt     responded saying kyrgios s post wa  one of the standard we can t put up with   <BRK>  just for the culture of australian tennis moving forward  can t do it   hewitt added   i don t think it s a good look  i ve spoken to nick about it  he understands that  whether he learns from it  that s another thing   <BRK> on sunday  kyrgios posted a photo of himself with de minaur on twitter  seeming to clarify that any bad blood is strictly intergenerational  <BRK> de minaur     is currently the highest ranked australian man  at no     he ha a game built on dazzling defense  with some of the flahiest footwork on tour  increaingly  he is presented a a golden boy of the sport in contrat to the ne er do well tomic and kyrgios  de minaur is so committed to playing for australia that he ha     tattooed on his chest because he wa the  th player to represent the country in davis cup  <BRK> a all of this wa playing out  matt dwyer  the chief tennis officer of tennis australia  got involved  too  issuing a statement on friday that highlighted de minaur  alex bolt and   year old alexei popyrin  all of whom made the third round here  and praising  each player s unwavering pasion to compete and their genuine love of the game  all underpinned the tennis australia value of excellence  loyalty  teamwork and humility    <BRK>  support and opportunity will be offered to player who live these value and demonstrate the commitment to maximize their potential  with our ultimate ambition being to develop and foster athlete we can all be proud of    the statement added  <BRK> the statement did not mention tomic and kyrgios  <BRK> other talented australian boy have fallen short in recent year  omar jasika  who won the   united state open in boy  single and double  received a two year ban last year after testing positive for cocaine  <BRK> oliver anderson  the   australian open boy  single champion  served a   month provisional suspension for match fixing for deliberately losing a set in a   match  <BRK> there ha also been recent tragedy  todd reid  the   wimbledon boy  single champion  died in october at    <BRK> asked if he wa uncomfortable with the good kid versus bad kid narrative that predominates australian men s tennis  de minaur demurred  <BRK>  there s a lot of stuff that happens off court  but i think at the end of the day what i really want is to be that boring guy that let his tennis do the talking  you know   he said   i want everyone to know that i m that kid that s going to leave it all out there  fight till the end  and just continuously want to improve  if i m that boring guy in the medium  then i m doing something right   <BRK> de minaur ha been able to stay away from the fray making his base in alicante  spain  after soundly beating de minaur in the third round  rafael nadal said he wished tomic and hewitt could learn from de minaur s aversion to advertising adversity  <BRK>  will be more normal if they sit and they talk   nadal said   more than do this thing here in the medium   <BRK> a hewitt lurched toward the end of a news conference that john mcenroe described a  pouring gaoline on the fire   he did not deny that there wa toxicity in the men s tennis culture in australia  but he insisted that there were good story  too  including john millman s upset of roger federer at the   united state open <BRK> for hewitt  the most disappointing part wa that the comment of a first round loser overshadowed other australian player  victory  <BRK>  it s one clown making a silly comment  and that s the main news   hewitt said a his packed news conference stretched into it  th minute  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
