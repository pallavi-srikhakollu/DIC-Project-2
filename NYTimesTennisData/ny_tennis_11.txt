 <BRK>  <BRK> on tennis <BRK> by christopher clarey <BRK> indian well  calif    deservedly no    in the world at age    naomi osaka ha not made it past the round of   in her first two tournament wearing the crown  <BRK> after stumbling at the first hurdle in dubai last month  she won two match here in indian well before running into belinda bencic  <BRK> though it is too early to start scurrying around the hall and sounding the alarm  it is not too early to observe that osaka is in the midst of an adjustment process that could take more time to work through than she imagined  <BRK> in a little more than six month  the japanese american with haitian root ha become a multicultural star with global reach  fired the coach who helped her zoom to no    winning two grand slam single title in a row  and hired a new coach who had yet to be a head coach at this level  <BRK> it is a lot to handle  a lot to digest  particularly with people like me poised to parse every performance for sign of trouble  <BRK> bencic gave her plenty to digest  beating osaka at her own game on tuesday taking time and the initiative away a she ended osaka s title defense in just   minute in the round of   the no argument score of           <BRK>  naomi wa rushed and didn t have time to dictate   said chris evert  an   time grand slam single champion   i don t think naomi had come across a player like that  all these big hitter like aryna sabalenka  and even serena  are not that close to the baseline  they are two or three foot back  but bencic play an entirely different game  and she played a flawless match  she s back  very back   <BRK> the proof is in her   match winning streak  which includes a title in dubai and five victory over top   player  born in    the same year a osaka  bencic ha the skill to challenge her often in the seaons to come if she can keep her head and health together  bencic will play fifth seeded karolina pliskova in the quarterfinal on thursday  <BRK>  i think at a time like this with that score line  i would usually feel very depressed and sad   osaka said at her surprisingly upbeat post match news conference   but i feel pretty good right now  because i think given the circumstance i tried my best  and i don t really have any regret  i tried to be positive throughout the entire match  honestly  she wa just playing so well   <BRK> it wa not osaka s first look at bencic  who turned   this month  they first played in a small money event in alabama on clay in    and osaka beat bencic            which came a a shock considering that bencic already wa a highly regarded junior player from switzerland and that osaka had barely played junior tennis at all  <BRK> but there wa no catching bencic surprise on tuesday  she already had beaten osaka in straight set at the   hopman cup team event  which is technically an exhibition  and after reaching the top   in   and then dropping back because of wrist surgery  she is playing with the point by point focus of someone who know that tennis success  with all it trapping  is not a given  <BRK>  i know how frustrating it wa when i wan t able to play at all   bencic said  sounding sage beyond her year  <BRK> osaka sound a bit wiser herself  the meandering  sometimes cryptic interview of   have given way to something more considered and open with occasional dash of her trademark whimsy  <BRK> this is not a coincidence  she watched clip of her past news conference and did not like some of what she saw  the  ums   the  like   at this new stage  she greets question  of which there are many  with respect  giving the impression that she is weighing each one before answering  <BRK> aked to compare herself now with when she won indian well a an unseeded player in    she gave another meaured response  even in defeat  <BRK>  i guess one of the biggest thing is i wanted to be more mature   she said   i feel like this is something i m still working on   on and off the court  it s one of the biggest goal that i have had in my entire life   <BRK>  i might have thrown a few tantrum last year   she added   and this year it s something that i m working on improving  and i feel like it s going well  i think i m just more confident in myself   <BRK> dismissing sascha bajin  her silken voiced german coach  wa certainly a bold move  under his guidance  she defeated serena williams  bajin s former employer  twice in    once in the first round in miami and once under much more duress in the united state open final  with bajin still her side  but apparently no longer in her confidence  osaka fought through another rough and tumble draw to win the australian open in january  <BRK> neither ha explained their split in detail  although osaka ha said it wa not a matter of money  she or some member of her team were looking for a lower profile coach  but there were clearly personal issue at work  too  <BRK>  something happened that must not have been good  although that s just speculation   said evert  who often watched osaka and bajin train in boca raton  fla   they were laughing and having fun practice and teasing each other  and it wa great  and then just before the australian and after the australian  it wa tense   <BRK> bajin is gone now  replaced jermaine jenkins  a former standout at clemson university who spent several year a the main hitting partner for venus williams  who dismissed her coach  david witt  and jenkins in the off seaon  <BRK> jenkins wa quickly hired a a national coach the united state tennis asociation to work out of it national campus in orlando  he wa just settling in when he got a text message from osaka s agent  stuart duguid  inquiring about his availability  <BRK>  i had a great new gig at the u s t a   and i wa doing my expense report and i get that text message   jenkins said with a chuckle this week   when a great adventure is offered to you  you cannot refuse it   <BRK> jenkins     know full well that job security at this level is fragile  which is one of the big reason he wa drawn to the u s t a  post  <BRK>  my wife and i live there in lake nona   he said   plus  with the coaching carousel  i didn t want to go back out with another player and then they wake up on the wrong side of the bed and say   hey i m not feeling this   i wa thinking more about security because there are only a few  i feel like  out there that are worth being out here for   <BRK> osaka  with her talent and star power  is certainly on that short list  and she and jenkins are now     after their first tournament together  which included one on court coaching visit that osaka jokingly began suggesting she wa having a midlife crisis  <BRK>  i just wanted to break the ice   she said  <BRK> keeping the mood light and keeping tennis in perspective seem like the right idea when there are all sort of new and powerful force at work  including celebrity and megamillions  <BRK> this also seems a good time for osaka to remember that the controlled power and controlled emotion that she displayed to win in new york and again in australia were anything but a fluke  <BRK> an earlier version of this article misstated when belinda bencic beat naomi osaka in straight set at the hopman cup  it wa in    not this january  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
