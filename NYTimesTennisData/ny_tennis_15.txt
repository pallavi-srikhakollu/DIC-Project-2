 <BRK>  <BRK> by ben rothenberg <BRK> melbourne  australia   lucas pouille  the brightest young star in men s tennis in france  wa flickering  <BRK> pouille     reached a career high ranking of no    in march  but did not win more than two match consecutively after that  finishing the year with a     run  playing without inspiration or belief  he slipped to no    the end of the season  <BRK>  i lost confidence  and then i wa not enjoying so much being on court  being on tour   he said   i didn t really want to play tennis   <BRK> he had to find a solution  he said   i had to find my joy of being on court   <BRK> pouille split with emmanuel planque  his coach of six year  in november  pouille  who had yearned to take a break from the tour but decided to finish the season so he could play in the davis cup final  wa on his own for eight day  when he did pick up a racket  it wa only to play minitennis with friend  <BRK> but on the monday after the davis cup final  which france lost to croatia  he met with his team s captain in waiting  amélie mauresmo  <BRK> pouille had another offer  coach him instead  <BRK>  when we were talking to each other  it wa this couple hour of talking that really had me thinking   mauresmo said   he had me thinking that he s ambitious  that he want to do everything in order to be a good a possible  he kind of convinced me with what he wa saying  that he wa ready to do all the effort and the hard work that are going with being at the top  with digging deep to be at your best   <BRK> stepping away from the davis cup position before she even started wa not an eay decision for mauresmo  especially considering the excitement over her appointment a the country s first female captain  but it wa made eaier  she said  the radical change coming to the competition this seaon  which will reduce the final round to a world cup style format played at one site  with three match of best of three set in each pairing  instead of five match in a best of five format  <BRK>  i think the captain s role will be really reduced   mauresmo     said   what wa interesting for me wa all the week of preparation  the three day of competition  the best of five  building a team throughout a year  and the home and away  for me  i grew up watching that  i grew up having the emotion that go with it   <BRK>  so i have no doubt that it will be a good show  a good competition for the crowd  and they will probably put on a big show or whatever  but a a captain  i didn t feel that the role wa that important   <BRK> pouille said he wa encouraged the belief mauresmo showed in him when she left such a high profile opportunity behind  <BRK>  that s what i wanted to have with me  someone who belief in me  and who belief we can go very far together   pouille said   i m very happy that she s part of it now  and we can work together  we can have the best result possible   <BRK> pouille is the only man in the atp tour s top   currently coached a woman outside his immediate family  but he said mauresmo s gender wa not a consideration in his decision to hire her  <BRK>  for me  it doesn t matter if it s a man  woman  grandfather  grandmother   i don t care   he said   a long a they know what they re talking about  in woman s sport or men s sport  in the end you re dealing with the same stuff on the court  <BRK>  mentally  it s the same stuff  technically  she know tennis  she know what i need to do on the court to be better  for me  that s what is important   <BRK> pouille s choice of mauresmo wa the second high profile hiring of a female coach in men s tennis this decade  the first wa in    when andy murray also hired mauresmo  <BRK> pouille s decision generated far le second guessing than murray s  which wa met with skepticism from both the news medium and fellow player  <BRK>  the pressure with andy wa tremendous  and the criticism that went with it wa huge   mauresmo said   i knew i had a lot to prove  and i knew that every match he would play would be about the job i d done  or not done  or could do better  that wa making it pretty difficult  but pretty challenging a well  and i worked really  really hard   <BRK> pouille said many of the query that came with his choice were more inane than negative  <BRK>  a lot of people have asked me   is it different that she s a woman  what do you do   can she come in the locker room    he said   but what is important is what s happening on court  what s happening to get ready for the match  and what happens after the match  i don t care who is in the locker room   <BRK> pouille said that  for now  he appreciated the lack of wasted time in his practice session with mauresmo  and also her drive and willingness to join him in his various fitness and running drill  <BRK>  you can see on the court that she s a champion   he said   the way she is on the court  the way she s committed to it  it s just remarkable   <BRK> pouille is hoping that mauresmo s coaching can help him return to the top    over the past three decade  french men s tennis ha packed the sport s peloton  but it ha struggled to catapult anyone into regular championship contention  <BRK> pouille is one of five active frenchman who can claim to have made the top    joining richard gaquet  gilles simon  gaël monfils and jo wilfried tsonga  together  they have reached only one grand slam final in the pat decade  when tsonga finished a the runner up at the   australian open  <BRK> mauresmo say she probably ha particular credibility in french tennis a a two time grand slam single champion and a former no    player  accomplishment that outshine those of all the country s other player   male or female   in her lifetime  but she is uncertain whether most men would be ready to hire a woman with le than hall of fame credential  <BRK>  probably not yet   she said   maybe not  but it will come  maybe not in the next two  three  five year  but it will come   <BRK> patience also wa required a pouille started his   seaon  he opened the year losing all three match he played at the hopman cup  a well a another at the atp tournament in sydney  but on tuesday at the australian open  he won his opening match convincingly                 over mikhail kukushkin  <BRK> though he wa relieved the win  pouille said his confidence in his choice of coach had never wavered  <BRK>  i know it s going to take time  coming from a year where it ha been quite difficult for me   he said   but i decided to work with amélie because i trust her   <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
