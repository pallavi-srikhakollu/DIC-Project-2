 <BRK>  <BRK> by kurt streeter <BRK> melbourne  australia   there wa nothing stefanos tsitsipas could do  <BRK> he tried pressing forward  only to see rafael nadal s whizzing reply fly beyond his reach  <BRK> he tried staying patient  only to find himself being run across the baseline like a jack rabbit with a one handed backhand  <BRK> he tried simply to hang on  hoping against hope that his legendary opponent would grant an opening  a reprieve  a string of game  maybe a set  nadal did no such thing  <BRK> on thursday night  nadal once again provided every hard hitting answer in a match at this tournament against an upstart opponent  this time he pummeled tsitsipas                 moving with brutal efficiency into his fifth australian open final  <BRK>  i am playing well today   he said when it wa over  assessing the match with a bland understatement  <BRK> his inexperienced opponent offered a fuller  more exacting description   it felt   tsitsipas said   like a different dimension of tennis   <BRK>  the woman s final is set  petra kvitova will face naomi osaka   <BRK> on sunday   having not lost a single set all tournament and looking in a fine a form on hardcourts a he ha in his career   nadal will play for a second title at melbourne park    year after his first  <BRK> he will face the winner of friday s semifinal between top seeded novak djokovic  nadal s longtime rival  and lucas pouille  a   year old frenchman who ha made his own surprisingly deep run in melbourne  before this tournament  pouille had never won a match here in five try  <BRK> nadal versus tsitsipa wa yet another match at this tournament touted a a battle of generation   all time great versus budding youtube sensation  <BRK> nadal     ha won   major championship and wa playing his  th grand slam semifinal  <BRK> tsitsipas     ha just a single tour title  though he enthralled crowd and flashed his talent throughout the tournament   including an upset of the two time defending champion roger federer   he is still relatively new to pro tennis  he had never previously advanced past the fourth round of a major  <BRK> despite the chasm in experience  it seemed tsitsipas wa playing well enough to have a chance  <BRK> instead  it wa never close  nadal came out sharply  targeting lethal  down the line groundstrokes to seize momentum with a break in the third game  from that moment  his power suffocated the young greek  <BRK> a much a tsitsipa tried to inflict damage with flat return  nadal rarely seemed rushed  he wa never broken  the first set wa over in   pragmatic minute  the second took    the third  another    by the standard of professional men s tennis  those set were sprint  <BRK> not long after the match wa done  tsitsipas  who wa seeded  th  looked dazed at his news conference  lacking any of the optimistic energy he d exuded after previous match  on tuesday  he had explained how he d learned from losing to nadal last summer in the final of the rogers cup in toronto  he had remembered coming off the court there feeling he would do much better next time against the spaniard  because now he had a sense of nadal s game   especially on hardcourt   <BRK> two day later  there wa no such gumption  <BRK>  he play just a different game style than the rest of the player   tsitsipas said  dolefully  <BRK> it looked a if he had just been pummeled in a boxing ring  <BRK>  he ha this  i don t know  talent that no other player ha   tsitsipas added   his game style ha something that it kind of make the other half of your brain work more than it usually doe  i m trying to understand  but i cannot find an explanation   <BRK> when nadal took to the dais a few minute later  there wa nothing but clipped certainty  his answer  coming in his familiar accented english  were all business  same a his game ha been for the pat two week  he said all the right thing about focus and routine and not getting too far ahead of matter  there is a final soon to play  this is no time for idle chatter or expansive thought  he wa bland in the way that tom brady is bland  <BRK>  i have to keep doing the thing that i am doing   he said   that s my feeling  just keep playing the way that i am playing and let s see   <BRK> bland  but effective  ruthlessly so  <BRK> nadal enters sunday s match having contested some of the most memorable final in this tournament s history  though he ha won only one of the four  his only title here came in    when he defeated federer in five scintillating set  in    he succumbed to djokovic after a   hour   minute marathon  the longest major tournament final on the book  in    he and federer staged the most recent of their epic major tournament duel  with federer winning in five set  <BRK> nadal also reached the   final  but he struggled with a debilitating back injury and lost to stan wawrinka  <BRK> seeded second this year  nadal began the tournament shadowed question about how long his body could withstand the rigor of a hardcourt grand slam event  he had not played a tour match since the united state open in september  when he retired from his semifinal against juan mart√≠n del potro  citing a leg injury  in november  he had ankle surgery  then  in the run up to the australian open  he withdrew from a tournament he had been scheduled to play in brisbane  citing a thigh strain  <BRK> asked if he expected to be back in this form  playing this well  gunning in his tour return for another grand slam title  his reply came quick   is not easy to be back after four month  and play the way i am playing   he said   of course  i didn t expect that at all   <BRK>  <BRK>
