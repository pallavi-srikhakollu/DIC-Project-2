 <BRK>  <BRK> on tennis <BRK> by kurt streeter <BRK> melbourne  australia   with the benefit of hindsight it is easy to see that these past two week at the australian open have been nothing more than a warm up for rafael nadal and novak djokovic  <BRK> maybe we should have kept from wasting time on the men s side and gone straight to the showcase  the final on sunday  when two titan will revive their rivalry and battle once again for the australian open crown  <BRK> the question of who would meet in the final became clear on friday evening  a djokovic cruised pat the french underdog luca pouille  winning                 <BRK> it wa a demolition both thorough and brief  and it mirrored what nadal had done in his final four clash the night before  when he dismantled fast rising stefanos tsitsipas of greece  <BRK> nadal took   minute  lightning fast for a match at that stage of a grand slam  djokovic versus pouille lasted only   minute  with djokovic riding his precision groundstrokes and feline quickness to the win  <BRK>  a perfect match for me   djokovic described it   from the first to the last point   <BRK> he looked calmly self asured a he said this   nothing like the doubtful athlete who struggled through a naty elbow injury and upset loss in melbourne in   and    during the one confounding low period in his career  his performance on friday had a transcendent quality  he said  and he called such a feeling  divine  and  in the zone  where everything flow so effortlessly and you are executing everything you are intending to execute   <BRK> he added that the semifinal wa one of the best match he had played on the sea blue center court at rod laver arena  <BRK> that s saying a lot  <BRK> he wa speaking  after all  of the court on which he will soon be aiming for a record seventh australian open title  of the court on which he won the first of his   major title  when he beat another french player  jo wilfried tsonga  in    <BRK> it is also the court where he played one of the most stirring  and still the longest  grand slam final in tennis history  the   hour   minute war of will he won against nadal in    one of the greatest match ever played  after which both player struggled to stay upright at the trophy ceremony  <BRK>  hopefully   djokovic cracked   we don t go that long this time   <BRK> you never know  <BRK> djokovic brawling against nadal for the  rd time   djokovic lead        is expected to scintillate  it may awaken memory of when the two were younger  fresher  but not necessarily better  version of what they are today  when they seem far and away the two best on the planet  their old rival diminished or injured or close to retirement  their new rival not ready yet  <BRK> for sport fan in the united state  this is one of those event worth setting the clock for  a match scheduled to start at the very uncivilized time of     a m  eastern on sunday  <BRK> just a in the run up to the   final  the serb  djokovic  is ranked no    in the world  and the spaniard  nadal  is no    and nipping at his heel  <BRK> but seven year on  they are also very different  the nadal of melbourne   is riding a game he ha clearly modified for this event   a change made  he ha acknowledged  a an adaptation to being    <BRK> here  at a tournament in which he ha not lost a single set  he is looking to keep his leg spry  his troublesome knee healthy  he is hitting more ball on the short hop  sticking closer to the baseline  volleying more  he ha also streamlined his service motion  cutting fat from his windup in a search for more accuracy and greater pop  <BRK> djokovic can see the difference  speaking of the man he described a his primary rival  take that  roger federer   djokovic noted that the change were working for nadal  <BRK>  i think he s backing his first shot up with that great serve  saving energy  and then he can go for more in the return game   djokovic said   with everything he posse  all the quality in his game  adding a lot of free point on the serve make him much tougher to play against   <BRK> both player have had to adapt  had to overcome recent difficulty  to get to this point  nadal arrived in melbourne with low expectation  having taken a hiatus from the tour after last fall s united state open  where he withdrew in the semifinal  citing a leg injury  in november  he had ankle surgery  <BRK> dogged his injured elbow at last year s australian open  djokovic wa routed in the quarterfinal hyeon chung  a south korean ranked no    at the time  that loss wa one of a batch of stunning upset he suffered in major championship after winning the french open in    plenty of question were swirling around him at the time  he often wore a hangdog  puzzled look on his face during match  where once there had been nothing but ice cold surety  <BRK> would he ever return to form  <BRK> but then  last summer  after elbow surgery and a remodeling of his priority and his coaching team  the old djokovic emerged  his health returned  so  too  did his steel trap resolve  he won wimbledon  beating nadal in a five set marathon that djokovic credited here with giving  a different  more confident self   <BRK> later in the summer  he won his  th grand slam at a sweltering u s  open  tightening his grip on the top of the men s ranking  <BRK> now he find himself again in a melbourne final  with a chance to repeat the glory of    a chance for a  th grand slam  just two behind the spaniard s haul of    within striking distance of federer  who sits at   for most in a career  <BRK> at his postmatch news conference  i asked djokovic to imagine a future conversation with his two child  who were not yet born seven year ago  and how he would describe that last epic melbourne night against nadal  <BRK>  how would i describe it   he said  pausing before adding a touch of humor   i ll probably not have them sit down and watch it because i don t like my child to watch tv that long   <BRK> then he grew serious  <BRK>  i would probably present it in more a general concept of our rivalry  that match would be icing on the cake   <BRK> on sunday  seeking a seventh australian open title  he will have the chance to add more icing  indeed a whole extra layer  to that cake  to the legacy of a glorious career  <BRK> an earlier version of this article misidentified the tournament novak djokovic won in   before suffering a batch of upset in major tournament  it wa the french open  not wimbledon  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
