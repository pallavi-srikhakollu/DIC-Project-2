 <BRK>  <BRK> by christopher clarey <BRK> difficult a it might be to remember at this time is money stage in tennis  the sport once had no tiebreaker  <BRK> long ago  every set had to be won a two game margin and theoretically had no finish line  which meant that at wimbledon in the first round of the men s single in    the great but aging pancho gonzales defeated charlie pasarell the score of                         in a two day match that lasted five hour and   minute  <BRK> the tiebreaker wa introduced to grand slam tennis the following year at the   united state open  with red flag being flown courtside whenever a set reached      <BRK> it ha taken   more year for the major tournament to reach the awkward phae where all four use different method to resolve deciding set in single  <BRK> the red flag are long gone  but the novelty effect is back  the australian open  which begin on monday  will use a best of   point tiebreaker at     in deciding set  which are third set for the woman and fifth set for the men  <BRK> later this year  wimbledon will introduce a conventional best of   point tiebreaker at      that will leave the french open a the only grand slam tournament that us no deciding set tiebreaker in single  <BRK>  i think the international tennis federation  the atp and the grand slam should find  more or le  some consistency of the rule for the understanding of the public   guy forget  the french open tournament director  said in an interview  consistency and mutual understanding seem particularly elusive at this fractious stage of the game  <BRK> the grand slam leader meet regularly and have usually made a big effort to project unity in the lat   year a their tournament have grown and prospered  but they have squabbled much more often lately  <BRK> there have been dispute about the possible introduction of in match coaching  which wimbledon s leadership continues to oppose  there have been disagreement about the new laver cup team event  which the australian open and u s  open are formally backing  <BRK> it seems symbolic that  with the australian open s switch from wilson to dunlop  each of the four grand slam tournament is using ball manufactured a different company this year  <BRK> breaking rank over tiebreaker is the latest sign of the time  even if it hardly seems a major offense  <BRK> other sport also lack consensus  consider men s golf  which ha four major of it own and four way of resolving tie at the top of the leaderboard after   hole  <BRK> despite any confusion  fan still seem quite capable of enjoying golf  tennis fan surely will end up feeling the same even if tiebreaker in their sport are a great deal more common than golf playoff  <BRK> top tennis player had best remain alert  however  <BRK>  i m o k  with any format  really   said roger federer  the swiss superstar who remains a traditionalist on some front  including in match coaching   the funny thing is we have different format now in four different slam  so it s just important to remind yourself when you do get to   all in the fifth  what s going on here now  do you remember which one it is   <BRK> for woman  that internal dialogue will come at   all in the third set even if there ha been little concern about the length of grand slam woman s match  which are all best of three set  <BRK>  i wa enjoying it  because you have to go far  and you don t know how the score will be at the end   said angelique kerber  who lost a taut australian open semifinal to simona halep last year                 i will miss it  for sure  but i don t know if it s a good or a bad rule change  we will see   <BRK> one wonder what jimmy van alen would think of it all  it wa van alen  a wealthy american  who pushed for brisker  innovative format   including the tiebreaker   in the  s  van alen  a former play who died in    wa also one of the driving force in creating the international tennis hall of fame in newport  r i  <BRK>  jimmy van alen would not have liked the confusion of different way of concluding match at the four grand slam event   said steve flink  an american tennis historian who met van alen several time  <BRK> van alen s idea of a sudden death tiebreaker managed to change the game in earnest   a best of nine point duel with a winner take all point at      which in a decisive set could give both player a match point simultaneously  <BRK> this wa the tiebreaker the u s  open adopted for all set in   at     but abandoned in   in favor of the best of   point tiebreaker that had to be won two and seemed  to the player  le of a lottery  wimbledon embraced the best of   point tiebreaker in    but chose to use it at     instead of      <BRK>  i guess tennis ha always had some inexplicable inconsistency with format and scoring system   flink said  <BRK> wimbledon maintained it scoring system until    when it opted for tiebreaker at      waiting   year before adopting a decisive set tiebreaker at     after last year s semifinal between kevin anderson and john isner  anderson finally won       in the fifth set on centre court  disrupting the tournament s schedule   <BRK>  i know jimmy van alen wa dismayed when his original sudden death nine point tiebreaker wa discarded   flink said   but i have no doubt he would have preferred the australian open fifth set tiebreaker to what wimbledon is doing  waiting until     in the fifth would not have suited him at all   <BRK> but for this year at least  the french open remains the last grand slam holdout  a decision forget said came about because  unlike wimbledon  the french open had not had an ultramarathon final set in recent season  <BRK>  we will not go with the tiebreak for now   forget said   but i hope personally that our sport will adopt new rule in the future a we need to modernize our game a bit   <BRK> ben rothenberg contributed reporting  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
