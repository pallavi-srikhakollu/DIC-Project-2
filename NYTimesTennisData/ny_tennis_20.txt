 <BRK>  <BRK> on tennis <BRK> by karen crouse <BRK> melbourne  australia   time did not freeze  like a televised sporting event placed on pause  during the   month serena williams spent away from tennis  the absence of williams  who ha averaged one title in every three major played  allowed younger player to wade deeper into the draw and grow their game and their confidence  <BRK> karolina pliskova     wa already on the rise when a pregnant williams took her leave from tennis after winning the   australian open  the previous year  pliskova had graced the final of the united state open  beating williams on the way  but it wa the only grand slam event where she advanced past the third round in    <BRK> with williams out of the picture from february   to march    the ascent of pliskova continued apace  advancing to the quarterfinal or better in   of   tournament in    pliskova assumed the woman s world no    ranking that july  two month after williams s last stay there  <BRK> in the eight major contested since williams s last grand slam title  at the   australian open  pliskova ha made it to the quarterfinal or better in five  with her               defeat of williams on wednesday in the quarterfinal of the australian open on wednesday  pliskova avenged a two set quarterfinal loss to williams at last year s u s  open  <BRK> the way pliskova pulled out the victory wa telling  she played the big point a fearlessly a williams     once did  down     in the third set  pliskova won six consecutive game and staved off four match point swinging for the line and serving to dime sized spot  she did to williams what williams did to kim clijsters in the   semifinal here  in that match  williams staved off two match point while climbing back from a     deficit  then beat her sister  venus  in the final to hold all four major title concurrently  <BRK> that williams had an aura that sometimes all but overshadowed her  the williams standing across the net from pliskova hasn t appreciably changed  in spotting the rest of the woman s game a full year  she simply gave everybody else a chance to catch up to her level of intensity and fight  <BRK>  this time i just feel somehow different and more confident   pliskova said   i m not doubting myself   <BRK> williams held her first match point while serving at     in the third  she wa called a foot fault on her first serve  then at the end of the point she turned her left ankle after pliskova wrong footed her  williams never called for a trainer to treat her ankle  <BRK>  at that point i didn t feel like i needed it or i didn t feel like it would be a big deal   williams explained  <BRK> there wa a good reason she felt that way  many time over the year  le than williams s best wa good enough  <BRK> but that no longer is the case  <BRK> williams s serve ha always been the weapon she can lean on when all else fails  on wednesday  williams didn t win another point on her serve after turning her ankle  <BRK> williams said of pliskova   i think she just kind of started playing really  really good  i don t think it had anything to do with my ankle per se   <BRK> williams wa right  did her level of play drop in the last six game  yes  but to focus on that is to miss the bigger picture  williams lost because during the year that she spent growing a child instead of a game  pliskova and the other top player got better  <BRK> if williams is to resume her winning way  she will have to play better than she did in    when she vanquished venus here for her  rd major title  <BRK> it is not impossible  williams s mission  if she chooses to accept it  is to forget the past and resolutely move forward  one honest day s work at a time  the good news for tennis is that she seems committed to the chase of margaret court and her record   major single title  <BRK> this wa williams s eighth official tournament since her return from a difficult pregnancy  the golfer tiger wood  with whom williams is friendly  won the tour championship in his  th official start after his return from back surgery  a long a williams is patient  she can once again prosper  <BRK> speaking earlier in the week  williams s coach  patrick mouratoglou  said it wa unrealistic to expect williams to hit the tour winning after the birth of her daughter  alexis olympia ohanian jr  she won no title last year  but reached the final at wimbledon and the united state open  losing to opponent whose masterly performance kept her off balance  <BRK>  you cannot buy time   he said   thing take time  to get back to shape  back in shape after a baby  a few month are not enough  i mean  still she could have won because she s doing thing other people don t  but it wa   i mean  the story said it wa too early  that s it   <BRK> williams didn t win six major before her  nd birthday because she wa a patient person  but motherhood is a daily practice in living in the moment  and williams is nothing if not a diligent student  earlier in the tournament  she said her year off  gave me a new fire  a new purpose  a new meaning   <BRK> it did the same for her opponent  which is why the woman s game is infinitely more interesting now that williams is back  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
