 <BRK>  <BRK> on tennis <BRK> by kurt streeter <BRK> melbourne  australia   this is a story about roger federer s third round match  only it is not about roger federer  <BRK> it is about a young upstart on the men s tennis tour  a lanky power hitting californian who posse skill and promise and a résumé stacked with solid but not spectacular result  <BRK> at rod laver arena this friday afternoon  the education of taylor fritz took a significant  though bruising  step forward  this wa a graduate level course held in front of     fan  taught with calculating precision a   year old swiss who ha won   grand slam title  <BRK>  yes  a real lesson   fritz said  once the match wa done   i m going to be better because of this match  i ll tell you that   <BRK> fritz  who is   and considered to be one of the most promising player in the game  had come to this australian open match on the heel of the biggest grand slam victory of his career  a tense  hard fought win over the  th seeded frenchman gaël monfils  <BRK> after that match  though he wa playing a confidently a he ever had  fritz wa cleareyed about his slim chance against an all time great like federer  he noted how his only previous meeting with federer had been a battle that went to the later stage of a tight third set  then fritz had crumbled  <BRK> this time  though aware of the long odds against him  fritz vowed to play loose and relaxed   have fun   he said   play my game  hit big   he wanted to soak up the moment  and learn  <BRK> at   p m  on a muggy afternoon  fritz finally took the court at rod laver arena  he had never played there  he smiled tightly  he fidgeted with his brown hair and white headband  his mind raced  <BRK>  there were a lot of thought going on in my head   he would explain  noting that he had simultaneously tried to pump himself up and find calm listening to rap on his headphone a he strode before the fan  <BRK> then the warm up began  it wa impossible to miss the fact that fritz s introduction took just a few second  when federer s followed  crackling over the public address system  it wa a condensed version of the swiss star s achievement  even shortened  it took a full minute  <BRK> now the match wa on  and it wa clear from the beginning that federer considered fritz dangerous  he had reason to  in that one and only meeting  in stuttgart  germany  in the summer of    federer had emerged victorious                 hardly smooth sailing  federer seemed determined not to let fritz get that close again  <BRK> so  from the start  federer displayed the fullness of his range  there were sharp angle and booming drive  there were heavily spinning forehand followed ball that cut flat against the hot air  it wa a level of play federer will need if he is to win this tournament for a third straight time  and a seventh over all  <BRK>  it s been a long time since i have gotten a beat down like that   fritz told me  unspooling the entire experience once it wa done   it didn t feel great  not at all   <BRK> the first set took   minute  federer       <BRK> in the second set  fritz fared better  he began using the leverage from his   foot   inch frame  with federer serving  fritz nudged ahead in a key game  federer responded with a pair of scorching forehand winner and a curveball ace  <BRK>  i get any of those point and i have a break point  a chance to break him and a chance to serve for the set   fritz said  <BRK> there wa resignation in his eye  but also a glint of hope   look  with someone a good a roger  you know that might be the only chance you get   fritz said   i can see now that you have to take it   <BRK> he certainly did soak up the moment  he loved every part of playing in front of a crowd that large  he tried a bit of showmanship  on one point faking a if he wa going down the line  then hitting crosscourt  problem wa  federer caught up to the ball  responded with a fake of his own and hit a winner  <BRK> fritz had been posterized  <BRK>  i tried to play with him   he said   and  well  he played me back   <BRK> then he spoke of his last stand  of trying to simply survive   regroup  hold serve  hold serve   he said he kept telling himself  like a mantra  <BRK> it didn t work  everyone could feel it  most notably his opponent   federer wa rolling   fritz said   i ve seen it so many time before  on tv  once he is in front  he smother you   <BRK> the end wa inevitable  the final score                 <BRK> next up for federer is the round of    and another dangerous young player  stefanos tsitsipas  a   year old from greece  part of a group of   and under men making wave in melbourne  the american france tiafoe  who turn   on sunday  is in the fourth round of a major for the first time after following his upset of fifth seeded kevin anderson with a five set win over andreas seppi on friday  <BRK> taylor fritz  meantime  will return to california  itching for more center court  more grand slam tournament  more match against the very best  against federer  he experienced aspect of tennis that  if copied  will add significantly to his growth  how to disrupt timing  when to use angle  the way pouncing on the slimmest opening can change tone  <BRK>  this wa such a learning experience for me   he said   i plan to take it and get better  get more comfortable in these moment  so i can play the way i know i can play  i plan to use this a a steppingstone   <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
