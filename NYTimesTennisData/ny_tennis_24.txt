 <BRK>  <BRK> by ben rothenberg <BRK> melbourne  australia   to show a fuller picture of the sport  woman s tennis is shining the spotlight on the coach who travel the tour with it player  <BRK> for   year  the wta ha allowed on court coaching at regular tour event  at this year s australian open  coach have given news conference of their own  following their player to the podium after match  last season  for the first time  the wta awarded a coach of the year award  which went to naomi osaka s coach  sascha bajin  <BRK> but nothing drew more attention to tennis coach than one getting in trouble  coaching during a match is not allowed at grand slam tournament  and serena williams wa asessed a code violation in the woman s final at the united state open in september when the chair umpire  carlos ramos  spotted her coach  patrick mouratoglou  gesturing toward her from his seat  his hand movement were replayed a much a any shot from the tournament  <BRK> williams s ire over the penalty  which she felt wa akin to calling her a cheater  set off a series of penalty that overshadowed the match  which wa won osaka  <BRK> afterward  mouratoglou admitted to making the signal  but added   everyone is doing it    percent of the time   <BRK> four month later  at the australian open  he continued to insist that the rule should change because coaching from the stand is already  completely tolerated   except for one or two people who think they re different   <BRK> ramos is officiating match at this tournament  but he wa not assigned to one featuring williams  who lost in the quarterfinal on wednesday  at least one prominent player   the men s semifinalist stefanos tsitsipas   ha been cited for illegal coaching in melbourne  <BRK>  i think it should become legal because we stop hypocrisy  first of all   mouratoglou said   second  because it s great for the show  and we want to have viewer who are not   year old  we want to attract the young generation  and we re not  tennis is not attracting the young people  and third  i think it s good for the player   <BRK> despite the wta s calling for coaching to be allowed across the sport after the incident at the u s  open  neither the men s tour nor the grand slam tournament have moved in that direction  <BRK> steve simon  the wta chief executive  said that coach  contribute an integral element to the on court and off court wta story   <BRK> simon s predecessor have seen coach a resource for enriching it product before  allowing on court coaching   year ago wa motivated more entertainment consideration than any desire for improving tactic  <BRK> larry scott  then the tour s chief executive  said the rule change came from a desire for  being a fan friendly a possible and being a responsive to television a possible without altering the fundamental of the sport   <BRK> holding news conference with coach is part of an initiative spearheaded the tour s communication manager  chase altieri  who came to the wta in   after working in the n f l   where coach  briefing have long been a feature of news medium coverage  <BRK> wta coach have embraced the program  both for the chance to articulate their view and to ease the burden on their player  bajin ha made television appearance in lieu of osaka to lighten her schedule of obligation during tournament  <BRK> a new section of the wta website includes profile of the coach  with detail like their current and previous partnership and off court interest  simon said the goal wa to  bring our fan inside our sport   <BRK> in recent year  the u s  open and the australian open have begun with allowing coaching during the qualifying round  with player able to walk to the side of the court where their coach is sitting during changeover if they desire a consultation  <BRK> mouratoglou is one of the strongest advocate for on court coaching  even though his player never us it  he said williams s sense of self reliance wa a weapon he would not dare muzzle  <BRK>  i think that her no    quality is to be the best competitor ever  and i don t want her to think that suddenly she need someone to be a better competitor  that would make her weaker   he said   so  for me  it doesn t make sense for someone like her   <BRK> mouratoglou  who ha worked with williams since    owns a tennis academy that bear his name in france and ha been a television analyst for espn and eurosport  he said tennis had many untapped area that could be mined for entertainment purpose  <BRK>  coaching is part of the game   he said   if you show it  it s an incredible adventure for the people to see   <BRK> before the australian open began  mouratoglou even released a mobile game  tennis manager  which offer user the chance to simulate recruiting  training and strategizing with tennis player  it slogan   shape a champion  become a legend   <BRK> bajin  who worked alongside mouratoglou for year when he wa williams s hitting partner  come down on the opposite side of the coaching debate  saying the rule should not be changed  to make it more interesting  to watch tennis  <BRK>  i think it take away the purity that tennis wa   bajin said   my father put me out there on the court in order to become more independent  to learn how to handle problem  to learn how to be myself  so that nobody can help me   and i think that still parent do that for their kid  that s why they want them to start this sport  because it s something special  and i wish we would keep it that way   <BRK> but bajin admitted that he  too  had occasionally tried to send illicit advice from the stand  <BRK>  sometimes you try to sneak something   he said   i m guilty of that   <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
