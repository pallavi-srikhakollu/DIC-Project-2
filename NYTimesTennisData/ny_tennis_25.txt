my game myself   <BRK> when albot wa    his father  vladimir  saw a tennis match on television and decided he wanted his only child to play the sport  vladimir albot wa able to arrange for his son to train at a school that specialized in tennis   a government funded academy near the family s home in chisinau  the moldovan capital  the club ha eight outdoor red clay court and two indoor court
