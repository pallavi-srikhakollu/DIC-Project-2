 <BRK>  <BRK> by kurt streeter <BRK> melbourne  australia   could the   australian open be the grand slam tournament in which a budding cast of young american men break through  <BRK> the odds remain against that happening   thanks in part to a guy named roger federer   and there remains much tennis to be played  but after a pair of second round upset france tiafoe and taylor fritz on wednesday  the stage just might be set  <BRK> the first surprise came when tiafoe  who turn   on sunday  finished off fifth seeded kevin anderson behind powerful forehand and serf  it wa the biggest win of tiafoe s young career and the biggest shock of the tournament so far  <BRK>  c mon   he shouted  rolling up his right shirt sleeve  then thumping his right biceps repeatedly with his left hand  a move that seemed freighted with both bravado and relief  tiafoe  the son of immigrant from sierra leone who learned the game at the maryland tennis club where his father wa a custodian  ha long been touted a a prodigious talent  but he ha also seemed burdened the weight of expectation  <BRK>  it mean the world to me   tiafoe told a crowd he had clearly won over during the tense three hour match  <BRK> the arena scoreboard flashed with the final score                      telling a story of it own  early on  anderson had pushed ahead  leading     in the second set after winning the first  then tiafoe turned the tide  <BRK>  i lost to kevin three time last year   tiafoe  ranked no     explained in an on court interview   i wa down a set and break today  i went to a different place  i dug deep  it s just how bad you want it  and i wanted it bad   <BRK> indeed  in the beginning  it looked a if tiafoe might soon be flying home for more practice at the united state tennis asociation s campus in orlando  fla   where many young american hopeful train  but then he altered his approach   and flahed the kind of game that he will have to employ if he is to get pat andrea seppi of italy  a tour veteran ranked no     in the third round  <BRK> he had decided to  kind of just mix it up   he explained   play smarter  don t try to go for cannon  be unpredictable   once he settled on a game plan  tiafoe wa particularly effective mixing a slew of low bouncing slice into his powerful repertoire  forcing anderson out of his comfort zone  making anderson bend and contort his   foot   frame  <BRK> how far can tiafoe go at this tournament  when i posed that question to him  he wa succinct   to the third round  man   he said  before laughing slyly  <BRK> should tiafoe beat seppi on friday  he would find himself deeper in a grand slam tournament than he ha ever been  maybe because he s keenly aware of that fact  he leaned on a tried and true sport cliché   but one that might show he ha enough locked in maturity to do real damage right now  he said he couldn t afford to consider anything more than the next match  <BRK>  look at today  i mean  he is five in the world   tiafoe said  referring to anderson  who is actually ranked no      i wa able to beat him  it s so tight now  anybody play a good match  you can beat anybody on a given day   <BRK> fritz     a californian ranked  th  can only hope those last word ring true  shortly after tiafoe s win  fritz upset  th seeded gaël monfils of france                                  the match featured some of the most exquisite shotmaking of the tournament s opening day  <BRK> like tiafoe  fritz ha never advanced pat the third round of a major  but fritz s next opponent is federer  the two time defending champion and no    seed  the two have played only once  federer won a tight three setter on gras in    a fritz wa just starting out on the tour  <BRK>  i learned my lesson last time we played   fritz said   i won the second set  and it wa one of the most amazing feeling i have ever had playing tennis  winning a set off roger federer  and then we were deep in the third and i had a chance to break his serve  and i started thinking  oh my god  i am about to beat federer  i might beat federer  <BRK>  and then that thinking definitely lost me the match pretty quick  i didn t win another game after that  i have definitely learned i just have to treat it like any other match   <BRK> playing federer in melbourne will not be any other match  of course  same for tiafoe  when he battle seppi  but both match present a real opportunity  <BRK>  between france and taylor today  we saw something different  something better  an intensity and composure i have never seen before   said martin blackman  the u s t a  s general manager for player development   all of our player can learn from this   <BRK> blackman oversees a group that includes the   footer reilly opelka     who upset ninth seeded john isner on monday before losing a five setter on wednesday  and mackenzie mcdonald     the former n c a a  champion who fell in four tight set to sixth seeded marin cilic  <BRK> if any of the young american men are to begin making a bona fide dent in pro tennis  there is no better time to start than now  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
