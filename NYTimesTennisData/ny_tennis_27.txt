 <BRK>  <BRK> by cindy shmerler <BRK> miami garden  fla    stephen m  ross swears he is not embroiled in a third set tiebreaker with larry ellison  the billionaire co founder of oracle who bought the bnp paribas open in indian well  calif   a decade ago and transformed it into a tony desert party for tennis player and fan  <BRK> still  when the moved and improved miami open begin this week at hard rock stadium  home of ross s miami dolphin  it will not be hard to imagine ross  a billionaire real estate developer  keeping a tiny scorecard in his back pocket  <BRK>  larry s done a great job   ross said   he set the bar high  and it s all great for tennis  but for u  it s more natural not to compete  or at least to do so in our own way   <BRK> ross  who bought the dolphin in   and spent    million renovating the stadium  stepped in when img  which owns the miami open  found itself at an impasse with a key biscayne resident who controlled the land where the tournament had been played since    <BRK> that man  bruce matheson  refused to allow    million worth of renovation to the crandon park site  and his prolonged lawsuit convinced the tournament that it wa time to go  <BRK> rather than see the tournament   and it hundred of million in local revenue   uprooted from south florida to orlando or china  ross decided to partner with img and move the tournament about   mile northwest to his football stadium  he spent an additional    million to transform it into a state of the art tennis venue  <BRK> the move wasn t well received everyone  <BRK>  key biscayne had a very intimate setting  and you can t beat the drive over the rickenbacker causeway  with blue water on both side of you   said john isner  the defending miami open champion   we had a lot of history in that place  and that stadium court will always be very special to me   <BRK> at the new site  a temporary main court wa erected on the football field  with half of the seat were blocked off screen  a     seat grandstand court  two other show court and eight additional match court   all permanent   were built on top of parking lot  <BRK> on a recent tour  those lot were indiscernible behind purple flower  artificial grass    foot mature palm tree costing      a pop  and a giant fountain that guard one of the many entrance to the stadium  there is also a   by   foot video screen  the largest in tennis  just outside the stadium in a spot modeled after wimbledon s henman hill  minus the grass  <BRK> the change recall the united state open s move from the charming but outgrown west side tennis club in forest hill in   to the more functional  if le romantic  u s t a  billie jean king national tennis center in nearby flushing meadow  it took a while to get used to the new dig  but no one would ever want to go back to the old one  <BRK>  this place ha a much larger footprint  so we can do more thing   said tom garfinkel  the dolphin  chief executive   we are giving people an unprecedented luxury experience in tennis  just like the n f l   <BRK> tournament organizer did not take the word  luxury  lightly  the stadium court   painted in color called oais blue and biscayne blue   seat      the same a the main court in key biscayne  but this court feature     premium seat  many that resemble barcaloungers  with individual television screen  these seat range in price from      to      for the two week tournament  some are right on the court  <BRK> premium seat package  most of which were sold out two month before the start of the tournament  include private dining room  some suite have seat made out of ferrari leather  for a privileged     visitor  there is a dedicated entrance from a private parking lot  in which spectator pas through a tent lined with art  including work pablo picasso and andy warhol that can be purchased for upward of    million  <BRK> ticket price at every level have increaed up to   percent over lat year  though several thousand ground pas are available for a little a    each day  sale the end of lat month were up   percent  thanks  in part  to dolphin seaon ticket holder who have been cajoled into watching tennis  <BRK>  there s a bit of a challenge in giving people the confidence that this really is for the best   said james blake  the tournament director  <BRK> ross helped choose everything on the site  the flower  the gigantic painting that line the stadium corridor  the tile on the bathroom wall  <BRK>  i had a picture in my head of what i wanted this to look like  the same way i do my real estate deal   said ross  who is also behind manhattan s hudson yard project   it s all in the detail  little thing matter  people notice  and they re watching for those detail   <BRK> the number of practice court  many with spectator seating  have doubled from those at key biscayne  to    but unlike in key biscayne  those court will not be turned over for the public to play on after the tournament end  <BRK> the player  at leat  should be happy  their amenity have been enhanced  with dining area and gym space tripling in size  the top eight seed in the men s and woman s single draw  a well a all former champion  will be given private suite to be used their entourage  <BRK> but organizer see the event a more than a tennis tournament  the ground will open at leat two hour before play begin each day to encourage people to come early to eat  shop and listen to concert local musician  <BRK>  what we wanted wa a venue that would allow u the freedom and flexibility to grow and innovate the event   said mark shapiro  president of endeavor  img s parent company   key biscayne wa lovely  but we simply outgrew it  what we ve got now is going to be supernatural  like walking through a lollapalooza  and a tennis tournament grew out of it  forget becoming the fifth major  we re the new u s  open   <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
