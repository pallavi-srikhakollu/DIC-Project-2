 <BRK>  <BRK> by christopher clarey <BRK> miami garden  fla    by reaching the semifinal of the miami open  the canadian youngster felix auger aliassime and denis shapovalov achieved something that roger federer and john isner never managed  <BRK> federer  for all his obvious and precocious tennis talent  never made it to this late a stage of a mater   event in single a a teenager  isner wa still a student athlete at the university of georgia in his late teen  <BRK> but neither auger aliasime     nor shapovalov     wa able to make the next leap on friday a isner and federer took turn holding back youth on the temporary center court at hard rock stadium  <BRK> federer     and isner     will now play an old guard final on sunday  <BRK> on friday afternoon  isner wa opportunistic in his                  victory against the silken auger aliassime  in the evening  federer wa brilliant in his          demolition of shapovalov  a flashy left hander with a one handed backhand who grew up idolizing federer and now ha a much clearer understanding of what it is like to face him  <BRK>  i just think he ha every shot mastered   shapovalov said   when he need a shot  he s going to make it  he s going to go for it  he s going to make it  i don t think he ha any weakness  that s why he s the g o a t   the greatest of all time  <BRK> federer ha had more vulnerable moment in his career and even one this month when dominic thiem  another younger man with a forceful one handed backhand  defeated him to win the title in indian well on march    <BRK> but federer ha been in a very fine patch of form  successfully rebounding from his defeat to yet another member of the new wave  stefanos tsitsipas  in the fourth round of this year s australian open  <BRK> since then  federer is      all on hardcourts  <BRK> auger aliasime is already quite a tennis package  explosive from the baeline  comfortable at the net and smooth on the move a well a in the interview room  where he can reflect in french or english  <BRK> on friday  in the biggest match of his career  the canadian qualifier acted his age only when it came time to close out a set  <BRK> isner    year his senior  ha long been one of the game s supreme server  but it wa auger aliassime s own serve that proved his undoing  <BRK> up     and serving for the first set  auger aliassime produced his first three double fault of the match and lost his edge  <BRK>  for sure  nerve   auger aliassime said   it wa like i caught a virus or something   <BRK> up     and serving for the second set  he double faulted and knocked a midcourt forehand swing volley into the tape on break point  <BRK> he wa soon back in another tiebreaker with isner  for whom tiebreaker are a natural a habitat a a swamp is to a gator  <BRK> isner ha played   set this year  more than half     have ended in tiebreaker  a reflection of his phenomenal serve and his limitation a a returner  <BRK> though isner had a losing record in   tiebreaker before this tournament  he ha gone     in the miami open  <BRK>  i m just finding myself pretty calm in those situation  maybe it s a little bit mental   isner said   i m just definitely playing my best tennis when i ve been in that situation this week  there is no doubt   <BRK> isner s defeat of auger aliassime put him one victory from defending the most significant title of his career  isner won this master   tournament last season  when it wa played about   mile south of miami garden  on the upscale island of key biscayne and with a permanent main stadium  <BRK> this year  the tournament moved to the ground of hard rock stadium  home of the miami dolphin  <BRK>  a completely different feel than last year  obviously   isner said  <BRK> there are clear benefit to the shift in site  more spacious and luxurious facility for fan and player  a le congested commute  a fine vibe on the outside court despite complaint about insufficient seating  above all there is the fact that this event  traditionally one of the most prestigious outside the four grand slam event  ha remained in the united state and in the tennis hotbed of south florida rather than being moved outside the country  which ha been the case for other united state based tournament in the past   year  <BRK> but the downside for now is that the main stadium often ha a low energy atmosphere  and though ticket sale have been brisk  fewer than half of the seat were occupied when isner and auger aliassime began play shortly after   p m  <BRK> the noise and age gap were more pronounced in the second semifinal  federer is    shapovalov is   and wa not even born when federer played his first main draw match at the miami open in    <BRK> federer mentioned that fun fact before the match to his twin daughter  myla rose and charlene riva  who are    closer to shapovalov s age than their father  <BRK>  they were like   what  hold on a second     federer said   i did the calculation  and they were like   so this guy is really young     <BRK> federer responded telling them he wa  really old   but he certainly did not move like it against shapovalov  who had practiced with him but never played against him in earnest  <BRK> federer improvised and covered the corner impressively  slashing forehand and backhand winner and hitting deft  precise volley  the only relative disappointment  a first serve percentage below   percent  but federer made the most of his first serf  winning   percent of the point and avoiding being broken  <BRK>  i think i played very well  i had to   federer said   because i think when you let denis play  he s got some serious power and he get the rhythm going and he can really put you in some uncomfortable situation   <BRK> so  in a very different vein  can isner  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
