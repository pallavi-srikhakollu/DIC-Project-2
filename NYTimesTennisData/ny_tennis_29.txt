morning  jack ming jie lin  a columbia university tennis player  informed his chemistry professor that he needed to reschedule tuesday night s lab because he had another engagement  <BRK>  look   he said he told his professor   i have a very important match feb    and i understand that we re supposed to have lab session that tuesday night  but unfortunately  i can t make it that night   <BRK> instead of chemistry class  lin  a   year old sophomore  will be playing his first atp tour main draw match  at the new york open at nassau coliseum  lin earned a wild card into the first round of the professional event winning a college invitational in november at billie jean king national tennis center  thirty two player from   new york area university  including army  cornell  princeton and st  john s  competed in the tournament  where lin beat alafia ayeni of cornell                         in a final that lasted three and a half hour  <BRK> lin s appearance at the new york open is a rare opportunity for an amateur to test himself against the pro  <BRK>  the knicks can never play a team like st  john s in a game that actually count   said peter lebedevs  the assistant tournament director for the new york open   in this  it is the pro playing a collegiate player  and it count for both of them  for a kid like jack  it s an opportunity to get point and to get started on a potential pro career after his college or during the summer   <BRK> a native of markham  ontario  lin ended the fall at no    in the collegiate double ranking with his playing partner  william matheson  and is no    in single  he helped columbia reach the round of   in the n c a a  tournament last season after the lion won the ivy league for the fifth year in a row  he owns victory over the current pro taylor fritz of the united state and denis shapovalov of canada  but those came in the junior rank  shapovalov is ranked no    in the world  and fritz no     <BRK>  obviously seeing them both develop into such big time player  i don t think i m at their level yet with the result that they ve been having   said lin  who grew up near shapovalov     in the toronto suburb   i m just more content with my own improvement over every month   <BRK> the new york open will feature many top american player  including john isner  france tiafoe  steve johnson and sam querrey  the former world no    lleyton hewitt is playing double  a are bob and mike bryan  <BRK> lin will play a qualifier on tuesday  and if he win  he would face johnson  ranked  th  some of lin s columbia teammate want him to face a top player to see how he match up  <BRK>  i want to watch jack play against one of the high caliber guy to see the difference between the atp guy and the level in college   said the junior jackie tang  who play for the hong kong davis cup team in addition to competing for columbia   <BRK>  i think he ll do well because i don t think the gap is that big  i think it s just the experience and the knowledge of how to play certain point correctly   <BRK> john mcenroe  who played a year at stanford  ha been a supporter of college tennis  pointing out that top   player like isner and kevin anderson have had pro success at older age after maturing while playing college tennis  most recently  danielle collins  a two time n c a a  champion at virginia  advanced to the semifinal of the australian open at    <BRK> lin said   honestly  i think college tennis is the best it s ever been  there are so many transitional player playing at such a high level   <BRK> lin s mother  sally yi  is set to come from toronto  and many of lin s coach and teammate plan to root him on a well   <BRK>  i love these play in format where it s not just arbitrarily granting a wild card to somebody   said the former american star andy roddick  who kicked off the tournament on saturday with an exhibition match against jim courier   it s a good story that somebody came in and earned it and this is what you get for your trouble  <BRK>  what s better than being able to work your way into the match that you dream about   <BRK> roddick joked that he would advise lin not to take the prize money so that he can remain an amateur  lin ha not planned that far ahead  <BRK>  obviously  playing the event s not really about the prize money   he said   it s just more about getting the opportunity to play in front of everybody on such a big stage and play against the top guy on the atp level just to ass what my level is   <BRK> at   foot    lin is short for a sport where more than half of the men s top   player are at least      but he is a shotmaker and is working on becoming more aggressive coming to net more  <BRK>  lin  who hope to someday be a top   player on the atp tour  considers himself part of the rising wave of canadian player that includes shapovalov and felix auger aliassime  he played for canada s davis cup team  but opted to come to the united state to focus on academic and tennis  <BRK>  in canada  there are a lot of great university there too  but they kind of lack the competition in tennis of playing in the state   he said   playing n c a a  tennis  it allows me to continue developing my game and obviously at the same time pursue my academic goal   <BRK> balancing the two set of goal ha been a battle  the men s tennis team a a whole carry a     grade point average  and lin doe not want to let his teammate down  <BRK>  there s a lot of thing going on  but he s managing   said bid goswami  in his  th seaon a the columbia tennis coach   he doesn t want to be left behind in his study  he had a really good lat two semester   <BRK> a for that chemistry lab  lin suggested to his professor that he move it to wednesday night  but if he win on tuesday  he won t be able to make that session  either  he ll be back on the court playing his second round match at the new york open  <BRK> in fact  he would have several schedule conflict to manage  the columbia team is flying to chicago on wednesday for the intercollegiate tennis association national championship  which begin friday   <BRK>  if jack win his first match on tuesday night and miss our flight to chicago for national indoors   the columbia assistant howard endelman said   that s a good problem to have   <BRK>  <BRK>
