 <BRK>  <BRK> by ben rothenberg <BRK> melbourne  australia   danielle collins  who had not won a match at a grand slam tournament before this year  pummeled second seeded angelique kerber in the fourth round on sunday  sealing the most stunning result of the australian open with a          victory that took just   minute to complete  <BRK> collins commanded the match from the beginning  dictating play aggressively attacking  particularly with her two handed backhand  she hit   winner in the match  compared to just six for kerber  <BRK> kerber  a three time grand slam champion from germany  had few solution for collins and wa unable to use her counterpunching to wrest control of the match at any point  <BRK>  it wa completely not my day   kerber said   i wa not playing the tennis that i can play  she played really well  i think she played one of her best match  to be honest  she hit  yeah  every ball in the court   <BRK> after losing the first set in just   minute  kerber walked off the court of margaret court arena in an apparent effort to change the momentum of the match  leaving collins grinning a she waited  <BRK> kerber won the first two point after she returned  playing with a renewed purpose and shout of encouragement to herself  but collins again announced her presence in the match screaming   come on   back at kerber after hitting a drop shot winner on the third point  <BRK> collins s pugnacious attitude is well known in tennis  and something she readily acknowledges and embrace  calling it  just part of the deal with me  on court  <BRK>  i mean  you all know  i m my own person  i m feisty   she said   i love making it kind of a war  if somebody want to get in my face on my unforced error  i have no problem getting right back at them and making it a feisty match  i love that  embrace it  i love when thing get competitive   <BRK> the tenacity in her tennis extends to off court pursuit a well  <BRK>  even karaoke   i don t have a good voice  but i always try to do the best at whatever i m doing   said collins  a   year old floridian   if i m not  i still tell myself i m the best  you ve got to believe it  right   <BRK> that unshakability wa clear a collins closed out her victory  kerber broke in the first game of the second set after their verbal exchange  but collins broke back in the next game  and then pulled ahead of kerber for good when she broke again for      <BRK> mat cloer  one of collins s coach  said that she had played  pretty flawless  in the first set and had done what she needed to retain the momentum  <BRK>  you knew after the first set that she wa going to come out and make that second push   cloer said of kerber   and she did  and danielle handled it really  really well  she showed great composure  but also didn t back down  she lost the first game of the second set  but she showed that she wa a little fiery at angie   <BRK> he added   i think that allowed her to show   i m still here  and i m going to fight this through   which i think didn t make it easy for angie to get out of it   and danielle just kept going   <BRK> collins  a two time national champion in single for the university of virginia  is the first collegiate player to reach the quarterfinal of woman s single at a grand slam event since lisa raymond at the   australian open  <BRK>  i think going to college helped me develop myself a a person   collins said   i really know who i am  the type of person i am  what i want  what i want to do with my life  what i want to do with my tennis  <BRK>  i have other interest and passion aside from tennis  i m able to relax a little bit more  maybe  than some other people because they ve kind of just been doing tennis their whole life  haven t really ventured out much   <BRK> collins did her homework before the biggest victory of her career  watching footage of kerber s match  <BRK>  i had a clear mind set of what i wa going to do   collins said   from the very first point  i showed her that i wan t going to let her into the match  that i wa going to dictate the entire way through  i stuck to my game plan  it clearly worked out well for me  pretty much smooth sailing throughout the entire thing  i wa just feeling really great   <BRK> collins ha been a quick study in the elite level of professional tennis  ranked  nd a year ago  she broke through with a run to the semifinal of the miami open last march  beating venus williams en route  <BRK> collins  now no    in the ranking  will face  th ranked anastasia pavlyuchenkova on tuesday for a spot in the semifinal after pavlyuchenkova upset no    sloane stephen                     simon goffin  pavlyuchenkova s coach  said he knew collins could rise to the occasion of an opponent like kerber  <BRK>  she really like these big stadium  to play against the seed  to be a bit of an underdog   goffin said of collins   she really like this  she s a tough challenger  she like a big challenge  she like a fight  so i m not surprised   <BRK> collins did not moderate her hope for the next match  <BRK>  hopefully  another amazing match of tennis for me   she said in her on court interview  one of several answer that drew startled gasp from audience member not used to such unapologetic self assuredness  <BRK> collins said she wa animated antagonism  <BRK>  i just love competition   she said   whether people are for me or against me  i m not really fazed it  i love it  either way  i kind of like it more when people cheer against me sometimes because i want to get them back  prove them wrong   <BRK> despite collins s ability to build up her ranking  success at grand slam did not come until this tournament  her first round win over  th seeded julia g√∂rges wa her first main draw victory at a grand slam event  <BRK> in her news conference  collins pointed out that her draw in her three previous grand slam match had been far from enviable  a she opened against a top   opponent each time  <BRK>  i did everything i could in those situation   collins said of her loss to caroline wozniacki  elise mertens and aryna sabalenka   sometimes it just doesn t go the way you want it to  everybody get their shot at the pie  right now i m certainly getting mine  i m doing very well  i m just kind of focused on that   <BRK> in her on court interview after the victory  collins made it clear that she wa confident of further slice of sweet slam success  <BRK>  i may not have won a grand slam match before this   she said   but i ve got to tell you  i think it s going to keep happening   <BRK>
