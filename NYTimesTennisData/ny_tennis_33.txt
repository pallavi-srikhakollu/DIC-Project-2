 <BRK>  <BRK> by christopher clarey <BRK> indian well  calif    a part of her morning routine  the canadian teenager bianca andreescu find a quiet place and visualizes success  big success  <BRK>  it s crazy to think that it became a reality today   she said after the roar had faded on sunday afternoon  <BRK> not so crazy if you observed all the shot and grit that andreescu had to summon under duress to defeat tennis elder after tennis elder in the desert and win one of the most prestigious title in the sport  <BRK> but it wa certainly far fetched when you considered her lack of experience at this level and the quality of the player she had to outhit and outwit  including the three time grand slam champion and former no    angelique kerber                 in sunday s final  <BRK> andreescu     is the first wild card to win the bnp paribas open  <BRK>  hopefully  this moment can be a great inspiration for many young athlete because  like i always say  if you believe in yourself  anything is possible   andreescu said during the award ceremony  <BRK> while she won her first tour title  roger federer wa unable to win his  st  losing to dominic thiem                 in the men s final later sunday  thiem  the no    seed  reached the french open final last year  but this master   title wa his most significant victory  <BRK> he earned it   just barely   putting his huge baseline power and flashy one handed backhand to work and breaking the   year old federer at     in the third set and then holding firm  <BRK>  i think it s not my right to congratulate you  you have   more title than me   thiem said to federer  who is  nonetheless  now     against the young austrian  <BRK> kerber  age   and seeded eighth  wa unable to prevail against andreescu despite a huge edge in experience  this wa kerber s  th final on tour  and only andreescu s second  kerber had won more than    million in career prize money  andreescu had won just       <BRK> kerber also had an apparent physical edge in the final phase of a grueling match  played in   degree weather  andreescu arrived on court with her right shoulder and right forearm taped after winning six match en route to the final  <BRK>  my shoulder ha just been really  really tight   she said   that wa more for prevention   <BRK> she required more treatment on her arm early in the third set  but despite looking bone weary between point  crouching down and stretching repeatedly  she found the will and  above all  the pattern and talent to finish off kerber on her fourth match point  <BRK> when it wa over  kerber kissed the teenager on both cheek  andreescu then crossed to the opposite side of the net  kissed the blue court and rolled onto her back  her arm and leg splayed a she baked in the sun and in one of the game s most unexpected great performance  <BRK> though most canadian at home could not watch the match on terrestrial television   only streaming wa available outside of quebec   her compatriot definitely noticed  <BRK>  bianca andreescu just made history  congratulation   justin trudeau  the canadian prime minister  posted on twitter shortly after her victory  <BRK> woman s tennis  which is in a deeply compelling phae  ha had a number of breakthrough performance of late  including naomi osaka s run to the title at indian well a year ago a an unseeded player  when she wa    that presaged osaka s victory at the united state open and the australian open and her rise to no     where she remains  <BRK> andreescu wa aked if she saw that a inspiration  <BRK>  no pressure   she answered quickly  smiling  <BRK> her questioner apologized  <BRK>  it s totally fine   andreescu said   yeah  it s definitely inspiration seeing her claim the trophy last year  and winning two grand slam right after that ha been amazing to see  but i don t really want to focus on the future right now  i just want to enjoy this moment  because i don t want to take anything for granted  you never know what next week brings  i just want to savor this   <BRK> next week will bring the miami open  where she ha a first round match scheduled against irina camelia begu of romania  the player she had to rally to defeat in the first round in three set at indian well  <BRK>  she s not seeded and won t get the extra day of rest   her coach  sylvain bruneau  said   so of course it s a challenge to go right to miami with very little rest and with the emotion and everything  but it s like that  and you have to go with it  it s the learning curve and the job   <BRK> andreescu  the only child of romanian immigrant  is the youngest woman to win at indian well since   year old serena williams did so in    <BRK>  you just played amazing the whole tournament  so you really deserved to win the title here   kerber told andreescu in her postmatch on court remark  <BRK> andreescu did not emerge from obscurity  she wa a highly regarded junior player who won the prestigious le petits a title in france  and though she wa not the dominant junior at the grand slam level in   and    she did win two grand slam girl double title  <BRK> in january  andreescu upset caroline wozniacki  then no    in the world  and venus williams to reach the final of the tour event in auckland  new zealand  and then qualified for the australian open  where she won her first grand slam single match  <BRK> but her run in the california desert wa still a huge leap  and the element of surprise certainly worked in her favor  the last six of her seven match were against player she had never faced on tour  dominika cibulkova  stefanie voegele  wang qiang  garbi√±e muguruza  elina svitolina and kerber  <BRK> the tour s veteran will now have a better idea of what to expect  but it will not be easy to identify area of weakness  <BRK> andreescu ha a remarkably complete game for a player of any age  much le an   year old  despite struggling physically at time against svitolina in their semifinal and again versus kerber  andreescu wa still able to display her full palette of all court skill  <BRK>  i think she ha a tennis that is really complete  and on the mental side  she s a warrior   said bruneau  who helped her on the mental side with some well chosen word on coaching visit in the second and third set on sunday  <BRK> andreescu can bang groundstrokes at a world class clip or change pace abruptly with slice  she also can hit rolling  off speed  angled winner from either wing that might well become her trademark  time and again  she kept kerber  a counterpuncher who thrives on consistent pace  from settling into a rhythm  <BRK> andreescu can attack the net or defend in the corner with her foot speed and excellent footwork  she ha a strong first serve and  perhaps more important in the return focused woman s game  a solid second serve that is difficult to attack  <BRK> andreescu also like the drop shot  which can be a joy and a curse   a wa evident against kerber  andreescu hit some exquisite winner and some tight  untimely error with the risky shot  but after failing to convert three match point on her serve at     in the third set  she roared back after the changeover to break kerber s serve for the victory  <BRK> ranked no    before the tournament began  andreescu will be  th on monday  she ha more than quadrupled her career prize money  earning        for her victory  <BRK> not bad  given that she still doe not have a high school degree  which she is trying to complete online  <BRK>  i m on that  but it s hard because after practice  that s the last thing i want to do   she said   i m just so tired  but i believe knowledge is power   <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
