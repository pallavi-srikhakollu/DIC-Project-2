 <BRK>  <BRK> by christopher clarey <BRK> indian well  calif    for the first three game  serena williams wa in a deep  irresistible groove  pounding serf and ground stroke a garbi√±e muguruza watched the winner zoom  <BRK> who could have known  a williams took a quick     lead  that she would not win another game on sunday  <BRK> with williams visibly hampered  increasingly slow on her foot and unable to hit serf at full power  muguruza reeled off seven straight game  muguruza wa up to a          lead before williams walked to her chair instead of changing end  sitting down heavily and then retiring from this third round match at the bnp paribas open  <BRK> the wta tour announced that the reason for williams s retirement wa a  viral illness   <BRK>  before the match  i did not feel great  and then it just got worse with every second  extreme dizziness and extreme fatigue   williams said in a statement released the tournament   by the score  it might have looked like i started well  but i wa not feeling at all well physically   <BRK> muguruza  a tall  powerful spaniard who is seeded  th  said   we played many time  and it s always supertough and superexciting  and it s never good to see someone not feeling well on the court   <BRK> the retirement wa the latest on court setback for the   year old williams  who ha had some remarkable result since returning to the tour last year after childbirth but ha yet to win a title  <BRK> this wa her second tournament of   and only her third event in six month  last september  she reached the united state open final before losing her cool and the match to naomi osaka  <BRK> in january  she quickly hit plenty of high note again on her way to the quarterfinal of the australian open  where she rolled her left ankle while holding a          lead in the third set against karolina pliskova  <BRK> pliskova went on to save four match point in all  she won the next six game and the match                 <BRK> it wa an unprecedented grand slam collapse for williams  one of the supreme competitor in the history of woman s tennis  <BRK> but williams returned to florida and the practice court and then returned to action at indian well on friday  playing one of the finest match of her comeback  defeating victoria azarenka            <BRK>  we re both mom  and we know how hard it is and how hard it s been for u to come back  you know  and starting literally from scratch and fighting our way back   williams said   it s been an arduou road  and i think we both really appreciate both of our effort to do the best that we can do   <BRK> when williams returned to court one to face muguruza  she wa soon striking the ball a cleanly and convincingly a she had against azarenka  <BRK>  i thought that match with vika wa such a high level of tennis from both of them   said kathy rinaldi  the united state fed cup captain   and today  serena started off carrying on  it wa coming off the racket  easy power and very consistent   <BRK> it wa their first meeting since muguruza defeated williams to win her first major single title at the   french open  <BRK> but williams  back in the top   and seeded  th  could not sustain her remarkable level  muguruza raised her own  fighting to hold serve in the fourth game  breaking williams in the next game and then ripping a series of backhand down the line winner to hold serve at love and even the match at      <BRK>  i think she started playing well right away  with her serve  with her shot  being very dominating   muguruza said   i had to adapt a little bit my position in the court  the way i wa hitting  and it took me a few game to kind of do it  once i did it  i felt much more comfortable to be able to release my tennis   <BRK> williams started the seventh game with an off balance double fault into the net and began hitting first serf consistently below   mile per hour  she double faulted again later in the game and barely moved a muguruza hit a forehand winner to go ahead       <BRK> williams then walked very slowly to her chair and looked frustrated on the first point of the next game  taking a huge  angry cut at a forehand return that she hit into the net  <BRK>  at the end of the first set  i felt maybe she wasn t feeling well  yeah   muguruza said  <BRK> williams soon provided confirmation  after losing the set  she called for a trainer and wa eventually surrounded the tour supervisor donna kelso  the trainer paige kensrue and a tournament physician  though kensrue arrived on court with a blood pressure cuff  she did not take a reading on williams and no official medical timeout wa taken  <BRK> after extended discussion  williams returned to the court to start the second set but did not win another point a muguruza held serve at love  <BRK> one of williams s signature is that after the first game of a set  she doe not change end on the chair umpire s side of the net  crossing over on the opposite side without approaching her own seat  but she changed her routine this time  heading straight for her chair and then retiring  <BRK> it wa only williams s third midmatch retirement since    her next scheduled event is the miami open later this month  <BRK>  i think serena always ha the confidence   rinaldi said   look at her record coming back from having baby olympia  two final of grand slam  i think she know what she is capable of  self belief  i don t think that s an issue  obviously today wa a little bit of a setback  but i think since she came back that she ha gotten better and better and stronger   <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
