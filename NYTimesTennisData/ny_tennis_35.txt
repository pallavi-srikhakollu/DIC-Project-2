 <BRK>  <BRK> by ben rothenberg <BRK> miami garden  fla    it s a familiar sight to have a top player s sister in the draw of the miami open  where this year venus and serena williams are both competing for a  th time  <BRK> but this tournament is the first time at a wta level event that top ranked naomi osaka wa joined in the single main draw her older sister  mari  <BRK> everyone else in woman s tennis is ranked below naomi osaka right now  including mari     who is ranked  th  and normally play lower level event  <BRK> she received a wild card for this tournament and played her first wta main draw match on thursday against another wild card   th ranked whitney osuigwe  osaka acquitted herself well in a          loss  <BRK> naomi osaka  who is   month younger than her sister  said that it wa  really enjoyable  to have her mari with her at a tournament  and that she hoped it would be an experience they shared far more in the future  <BRK>  for me it would be a dream   osaka said   because i don t really talk to that many people  and she s the nicer one in this relationship  it would definitely mean a lot   <BRK> though sibling like the williams or marat safin and dinara safina have risen to the peak of the sport  sibling with far different career altitude are more common  <BRK> naomi osaka s opposite number in the men s tour  top ranked novak djokovic  had two younger brother who struggled in the large shadow he cast  despite receiving many wild card  marko djokovic reached a career high ranking of no     djordje djokovic reached no       marko     now coach and competes only occasionally  while djordje     stopped competing in    <BRK> novak djokovic     said that his brother  decision to step back from tennis had come a a relief to him  <BRK>  i m glad they ve decided themselves what they want to do  because in the end of the day it s something that give me satisfaction and peace  knowing that they made the decision  not myself or my parent or anybody else   djokovic said   because in this kind of circumstance  they feel obliged  or they feel pressure that they have to meet the expectation of the other brother or sister  because if you re part of the same sport  naturally  everyone will compare you to your other sibling  it s not ideal  especially if your other sibling is the best in the world   <BRK> sibling of top player have often drafted off that familial fame to get started in their career  but the main draw wild card for mari osaka raised many eyebrow around the tournament  considering she wa ranked more than   spot below the cut for the qualifying draw for this elite event  james blake  the miami open tournament director  said the decision to double the number of osaka in the draw had been an easy one  <BRK>  obviously naomi is someone that s accomplished so much  and you want to encourage her sister a well   blake said   you wonder if there s a lot of talent and she han t had the same opportunity  we know she ll also be a draw  naomi ha so many fan  mari is going to hopefully gain some of those fan asociation   <BRK> blake  who reached a career best of no     had a brother  thomas  who reached  th   a parallel that he admitted tinted his view  <BRK>  he got some wild card  definitely with the blake name   james blake said   he really appreciated them  mari ha thanked me  her parent have thanked me  they realize that this is a big opportunity for her   <BRK> it is rarer for the younger sibling to make a splash on tour first  for most of their childhood  mari had dominated her younger sister in practice match  <BRK>  up until i wa   she wa     ing me  ridiculous   naomi said   i don t know what happened  maybe finally something clicked in my head  but for sure she wa beating me  in the win loss record  she s up like a million or something   <BRK> both entered the qualifying draw of the wta tournament in stanford  calif   in    naomi  then    reached the main draw and then stunned the   united state open champion  samantha stosur  in the first round  <BRK>  it s probably the second best win of my life   osaka said after that victory   the first being when i first beat my sister   <BRK> a naomi continued to soar upward  mari s trajectory stalled  her career best ranking wa  th lat may  before thursday she had not competed for more than a month because of a right shoulder injury  her first match this seaon wa a          loss to  st ranked katie volynets  a far cry from the competitive level she showed on thursday  <BRK> mari osaka said she wa determined to play this tournament  knowing for the past six month that she would be awarded a wild card  <BRK>  it wa just super exciting and new for me   mari said of the experience   i m super thankful that i actually got it   <BRK> she smiled at the mention of her sister s rise from  th to first in the ranking since the beginning of last year   i m really proud of her   mari said  <BRK> asked if she wa able to focus on her own path or felt she had  big shoe to fill   mari said   my own journey is separate  but of course i tend to compare a little bit  so it s frustrating  but  you know  not much i can do about that   <BRK> osaka then abruptly broke into tear  she apologized  accepted a moderator s offer to leave the room to regain her composure  and returned several minute later  <BRK> when she returned  she wa able to focus on the positive she took from the match  <BRK>  i played this match with no pain  which i haven t done in such a long time   she said   it feel really good  like i can keep moving forward from here   <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
