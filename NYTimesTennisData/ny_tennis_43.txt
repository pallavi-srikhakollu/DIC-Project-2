 <BRK>  <BRK> by karen crouse <BRK> melbourne  australia   the reigning united state open champion  naomi osaka  wa serving to extend her third round match against hsieh su wei when she rolled her right foot while running for a ball and tumbled to the ground  prompting the chair umpire to ask if she wa o k  <BRK>  no   osaka replied  but she wa laughing  <BRK> osaka     who wa born in japan and is based in florida  had already squared herself once  picking her game up after dropping the first set and falling behind          in the second against taiwan s hsieh  a big seed slayer with a bedeviling slice  <BRK> by rising to hold off hsieh                osaka showed that she is more than o k  she proved that she is maturing in front of everybody s eye like a polaroid picture  <BRK> osaka s round of   opponent is anastasija sevastova  whom she defeated in three set   after dropping the first   in the quarterfinal of a tuneup event in brisbane two week ago  osaka struggled with her composure early on against sevastova in what turned out to be a prelude to a hissy fit  <BRK> in a straight set semifinal loss to lesia tsurenko  osaka came unstrung  she committed   unforced error  wa broken three time and sulked between shot in a display that she apologized for later on her twitter account  <BRK>  had the worst attitude on the court today   osaka wrote   sorry to everyone that watched  i keep telling myself to be more mature but seems it ll take a while   <BRK> fast forward to margaret court arena in melbourne two week later  in the first set against hsieh  osaka produced   unforced error and wa broken three time  so upset wa osaka her start that she kicked her racket on the changeover before the second set  an act of petulance that resulted in her receiving a code violation  <BRK>  of course i would have preferred not to do that  and i m really sorry that i did   osaka said   but hopefully i ll learn from that moment   <BRK> it seemed that osaka had learned nothing from brisbane when she stood five point from defeat  but a funny thing happened on her way to another dispiriting result  osaka laughed at her plight  and that moment of mirth acted like a release valve  letting out all the pressure that had been building since she dispatched serena williams in straight set in new york to win her first major title  <BRK> instead of feeling  a she put it   that either i win the match or i die   osaka relaxed and started playing calmer  smarter point  blating her way into the tournament s second week  <BRK>  she wa just playing so well   osaka said  referring to hsieh   and i think i got overwhelmed  and then early in the second set i tried doing thing that i know isn t necessarily my game  like i wa trying to hit higher ball and i don t even practice doing that   <BRK> she added   then after a while  i just started thinking that i m in a grand slam  i shouldn t be sad  i m playing against a really great player so i should just enjoy my time and try and put all my energy into doing the best that i can on every point   <BRK> in both her title run in    at indian well and flushing meadow  osaka won every first set  her overall record last year when she lost the first set wa      so she is pleased to have already posted two victory  against sevastova and hsieh  this month after slow start  <BRK>  i think the more match that i play like this  the tougher one  then maybe a i go on it won t seem a hard   osaka said  adding   i m happy with how i fought  for me  that s one of the biggest thing i always thought i could improve  because it sort of seems like before i would accept defeat in a way   <BRK> hsieh presented a stout test because the bigger the stage  the better she seems to play  at last year s tournament  hsieh upset the third seeded garbi√±e muguruza and the former woman s world no    agnieszka radwanska before taking the former champion and ex woman s world no    angelique kerber to three set  <BRK> but a osaka showed against serena williams in their u s  open final  she too embrace the big stage   there is the most attention during grand slam  and more people come out than anywhere else   osaka said   so definitely it make me really happy  and i try to sort of channel that in my tennis   <BRK> when osaka is home  she train at the academy in boca raton  fla   run the   time grand slam single champion chris evert and her brother  john  <BRK>  she s very nice   osaka said  referring to evert   whenever i do see her  she always come up and say a lot of encouraging word  so i m really grateful for her   <BRK> osaka s eyebrow danced a she divulged a secret  whatever advice evert offer  osaka absorbs it without question  for some reaon  she added slyly  her coach  sacha bajin  and evert can say the exact same thing  but it really resonates when evert say it  <BRK>  not that i m  like  ragging on sascha   osaka said  grinning   but it feel like i should listen to her more in a way because   oh  i m going to get so much hate   i have seen what she did and she s also played  so it s a little bit more believable   <BRK> before the tournament began  evert described osaka a  reliable   and here osaka is  right on schedule  two victory from a potential rematch with williams in the semifinal  <BRK> reliable  yeah  that s believable  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
