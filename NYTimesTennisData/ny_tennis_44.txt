 <BRK>  <BRK> by ben rothenberg <BRK> melbourne  australia   amanda anisimova is seen many a the future of american tennis  but she sometimes yearns for a second opinion from a third eye  <BRK> she drive so many psychic reader around her home in south florida   i always want to go in   anisimova     said  <BRK>  i m kind of scared  because i don t want to know what my future is going to look like  i want it to be a surprise   she added   but i want to hear what they have to say   <BRK> no clairvoyance wa necessary to see anisimova s potential a she dominated  th seeded aryna sabalenka            on friday to reach the fourth round of the australian open  that victory made anisimova the first player born this century to reach the second week of a grand slam tournament  and the youngest american to do so since serena williams at the   french open  <BRK> not all forecast were accurate  however  before the match began  a tennis australia  win predictor  graphic gave anisimova only a   percent chance of beating sabalenka  who wa a popular pick to win the tournament among many pundit and the oddsmakers  third favorite behind only williams and angelique kerber  <BRK>  that s a pretty rough number   i m surprised that   anisimova said   but she s a top player  she s had such a great year  i wa just playing really well  and she wa playing really well  too  we had a great match  and it just ended up going my way today   <BRK> anisimova  ranked  th  is likely to be undaunted her next opponent  sixth seeded petra kvitova  whom she beat last year in indian well  calif  <BRK>  every player here is going to be great  and every round is going to be tough   she said   i just focus on myself  and i m not really scared of anyone  i don t fear anyone  i just have a lot of confidence in myself  and i m ready for tough match   <BRK> although anisimova s ability to dictate play against the ultra aggressive sabalenka gained more attention  one of her hardest match came in her first round against the tricky veteran monica niculescu  who play a game chock full of funky slice that have driven many more established player crazy  <BRK>  there isn t a teenager who would have won the first round against niculescu besides amanda   said her agent  max eisenbud   that match  until today s match  wa her most impressive win  the way niculescu slice and throw everything at you  it wa getting tight  and she wa able to perform  a crafty  experienced girl who threw everything at her  and she still won in straight set   <BRK> eisenbud also represents the player to whom anisimova is most often compared  maria sharapova  while he said that comparison between the two   blonde with russian root who stormed the tennis stage at a young age   were unfair to both  he observed that anisimova and sharapova did share a diligent work ethic and an ability not to be fazed in the biggest moment  <BRK> france tiafoe  who also reached the second week of a grand slam for the first time on friday  gushed over anisimova  in his own way  <BRK>  it s like she s been a veteran   tiafoe said   she s going out here  and sabalenka is playing great tennis   she routined her like it wa nothing  it wa barbecue chicken for her  it s unbelievable   <BRK> in her news conference friday  anisimova said that her confidence wa growing  <BRK>  i believe in myself so much more than i ever did in this tournament   she said   it s just trusting myself  that s why i have been also playing really well   <BRK> that confidence lead her to hope she can follow in sharapova s footstep in another way  becoming a grand slam champion a a teenager  aked what her dream wa for her career  anisimova expressed a desire for instant gratification  <BRK>  i want to win this tournament   right now   she said  smiling  <BRK> anisimova  who broke through at the junior level winning the   united state open girl  title  complement her desire for immediacy with an uncommon curiosity about the past  expressing her admiration for billie jean king  the pioneer who played a formative role in getting woman s professional tennis off the ground  <BRK>  back then it wa so different and so difficult   anisimova said   how much she worked  it wa just crazy  everything that she wa doing just really surprised me  and that s something also i remember  i tell myself i m tired after an easy day   then seeing how much stuff she wa doing  it wa amazing how much she s done for the wta and woman s tennis   <BRK> modern issue are also a concern for anisimova  she wa particularly affected the shooting last february that killed   at marjory stoneman douglas high school in parkland  fla   near where she train  <BRK>  i m not in a little tennis bubble   she said   the gun thing  it wa so close to home  i know a girl who go to that school  so it wa just very scary  i just thought at the time   and i still think to this day   that gun are very dangerous and we shouldn t be having them  using them   <BRK> anisimova wa born in freehold  n j   but drew a blank when asked about the town s most famous export   wait   bruce who   she asked   is he  like  old   <BRK> after a few bar of  born in the u s a   were hummed and a brief description wa provided  anisimova acknowledged some faint recognition of bruce springsteen s work but said it wa unfair to expect more from someone born in    <BRK>  yeah   she said   how am i supposed to know that   <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
