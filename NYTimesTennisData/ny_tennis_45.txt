anz  a bank that is one of the open s major sponsor  and appears in advertisement around the ground and on television  alcott also served a a courtside analyst for nine  the australian network that broadcats the tournament  during the rest of the year  he work a a radio host for national music station  <BRK> when the broadcaster gerard whateley introduced alcott at a meet and greet event on monday  he made it clear alcott needed no introduction   you  sir  are inescapable   <BRK> being seen and heard a much a possible is a mission in itself for alcott  <BRK>  when i wa a kid and i wa getting bullied at school and i wa really upset  i d say   i don t know anyone like me  i don t see anyone like me on the tv or on the radio or the newspaper  and that suck  that s not fair    he said   <BRK> alcott said he did not grasp the power of his celebrity until his commercial began to air last year  <BRK>  we got video of a little kid in a wheelchair  and every time the ad come on  he roll over to the tv and hug it  because he saw someone like him on tv   alcott said   we get hundred like that  and that s so cool   <BRK> the attention can be exhausting  especially in the midst of competing in a grand slam event  everywhere he go around melbourne  people stop  turn and smile in recognition  though it can eat up hour of his day  alcott swerve toward those people  rather than away from them  introducing himself and offering to take a photograph  <BRK> alcott also ha savored the acceptance of his fellow athlete with whom he ha shared the locker room  especially the australian one who he see year round at melbourne park  last saturday  alcott chatted with the   time grand slam champion roger federer at the net when their session overlapped on a practice court  <BRK>  it s like you re just one of them   alcott said   they treat me so well  it s amazing  it s cool  and i don t think any other wheelchair athlete have that  they say   hi   and it s like they

to alcott s celebrity  <BRK>  i introduced myself to tsitsipas   alcott said   and he said   mate  you re the most famous guy here  of course i know who you are   i ll take that  that s surreal   <BRK> kris dent  an executive with the international tennis federation  said alcott s appeal transcended sport  <BRK>   you can t fail to notice that when you come to australia   dent said   he s become much more than just an athlete  it s a phenomenal story that he ha    <BRK> the top ranked man in able bodied tennis  novak djokovic  ha tried his skill in a wheelchair across the net from alcott  which he said made him appreciate the challenge and the craft of the discipline  <BRK>  dylan deserves the popularity   djokovic said   he s a very great guy  very charismatic  i ve said it before  these guy are hero to me  they really are  they make the game of tennis more beautiful and more unique because of what they do and how they do it   <BRK> after winning paralympic gold medal in single and double in    alcott wa presented tennis australia s newcombe medal  which go annually to the country s top player  alcott said winning an award in a general category rather than one

five week old  health struggle continued throughout his childhood  with his ability to use his extremity worsening at time  both gradually and suddenly  <BRK> in    an inebriated acquaintance tried to pick up his chair and dumped him onto the floor  which wa covered in broken glass  alcott severed an artery in his hand in the fall  damaging his ability to use his right hand fully  which is one of the reason he competes in the quad division  that spelled the end of his wheelchair basketball career and led him to focus on tennis  which he had started playing around age   or    <BRK>  the biggest thing is being really proud of my disability  which is kind of different   alcott said   most people don t want to talk about it  i always say   nah  let s talk about it  openly and all the time   people buy into that   <BRK> though frank and candid about his challenge  alcott also ha tried to share the fullness of his life   <BRK>  people that have a car accident think their life is over  because road safety ad say   if you drink and drive and end up in a wheelchair  your life s over   a a deterrence   alcott said   people look at me and think it s the same   <BRK> that s why in his autobiography   able   a best seller published last fall  he said   i talk about the first time i had sex  when i travel  everything  to be given the platform to do that  that s so cool   <BRK> the platform for alcott s tennis also is growing  his second round robin match  a                   victory over david wagner  wa broadcast live on national television  in his on court interview  alcott seemed more ecstatic about the viewership than the victory  hoping that disabled people around australia had watched and drawn inspiration   by contrast  he won the united state open in september on an indoor practice facility rather than a main stadium because of rain    <BRK> alcott  a hip hop fan who ha rapped on stage with ghostface killah  started his own music festival  ability fest  which catered to the need of disabled people often left out of such event  the event featured interpreter for the deaf and elevated platform for seated viewer  <BRK> alcott also founded get skilled access  a consulting group that work to improve how government and corporation interact with disabled people  his foundation finance opportunity for disabled people because  he noted  he need      for a wheelchair while his brother needed only    pair of shoe to play australian rule football  <BRK>  it might not be paralympics  it might be a cello  it might be a scholarship to go to university and become a lawyer   alcott said   why don t we see people with disability in boardroom  in the mainstream  it s because they haven t been given the opportunity  and we want to provide that   <BRK> alcott had a     record last year on quad tennis circuit  which is for player with at least three extremity affected a permanent physical disability  he hope he  too  can grow into something bigger and more powerful than just a tennis player  <BRK>  i could win   grand slam and i d be happy   he said   but i d regret not doing what i love the most  which is changing perception of disability  which broadcasting help   <BRK> alcott said he would like to move to new york or london to reach a wider audience  <BRK>  why couldn t a guy in a wheelchair be the next jimmy fallon  or whatever it is   he said  <BRK> a he started to expand on his vision for success in america  alcott stopped and gestured to something much closer  a girl standing a few meter away  staring at him with a huge smile
