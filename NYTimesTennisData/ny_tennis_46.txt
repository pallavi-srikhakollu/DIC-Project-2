 <BRK>  <BRK> by kurt streeter <BRK> melbourne  australia   the first point of the australian open men s final on sunday told the story of all that wa to come  <BRK> with his opening serve  novak djokovic stretched rafael nadal wide  sending the spaniard sprawling  djokovic quickly had his longtime rival exactly where he wanted  off balance and unglued  <BRK> in a flah  a nadal spun   degree and scrambled to recover  djokovic took a half dozen confident step forward  he lined up a backhand and then unleahed a buzzing winner that nadal did not even try for  <BRK> point won  point made  rafael nadal  toast  <BRK> the match  held at rod laver arena on a warm and slightly breezy evening  finished just   hour   minute later  djokovic winning in a full blown knockout                 <BRK> this wa a win that tightened the   year old serb s hold on the top spot in men s tennis  it also elevated his name once again in the annals of tennis history  he now ha a record seven australian open title and ha moved to sole possession of third place for major title  with    breaking a tie with pete sampras  <BRK> the three powerhouse set were a fine and dominating a djokovic   or anyone   ha ever played in a major tournament final  <BRK>  it rank right at the top   djokovic said  assessing his performance at a news conference   at this level  under these circumstance  it wa truly a perfect match   <BRK> he could not have seen this coming  nobody could  <BRK> djokovic versus nadal  no    v  no     wa arguably the most anticipated match of the tournament  it wa the first occasion in which these two tense rival   who have now played   time on tour  with djokovic winning     had met in the final of a grand slam event since    when nadal slipped djokovic in four set at roland garros in paris  <BRK> given the scintillating way both had performed throughout the tournament  with nadal winning every set he played in his first six match and with djokovic winning all but two  it seemed certain that they would duel once again deep into the melbourne night  <BRK> it wa a match that wa expected to dust off hallowed memory of what might have been their greatest combined moment of glory  in    the two played one of the most epic final in grand slam history  right on laver s sea blue center court  a   hour   minute marathon won djokovic  the longest major final ever  <BRK> but a reprise wa not to be  what unfolded wa not even a reasonable facsimile  <BRK> still  the night had it own way of being unforgettable  the final failed to offer drama  but it did present beauty   that of a top flight athlete  among tennis s greatest champion  operating at the very peak of his power  <BRK>  thing started so quick   nadal said  snapping his finger twice to emphasize the point   he wa pushing me to every ball  he played so well  he hit so long  his return wa fantastic  he wa super quick   <BRK> nadal     did not appear particularly downcat after the match  instead  it seemed a if he had simply resigned himself to the result  he noted that he had been injured and had not been able to prepare for the tournament a he had wished  indeed  after pulling out of his semifinal match at the united state open lat september and then having ankle surgery  he had not played a match on tour until this tournament began  <BRK> but he also allowed that there had been nothing he could really do on sunday against djokovic  saying it  wa unbelievable  the way that he played  no doubt about that   <BRK> djokovic made only nine unforced error  he lost just one point on his serve in the first set  he aggressively shortened every rally he could  keeping them to an average of five shot  a stunningly low number considering the long distance final he and nadal have slugged out in the past  riding pinpoint accuracy and depth  he so flummoxed nadal that the spaniard once swung and whiffed on a forehand  <BRK> nadal  whose tally for major title remains at    three behind roger federer s record  threw all he could muster at the match  especially a it drained from his grip  he worked in a many drop shot a he could  he altered positioning on his return  he moved early  trying to guess which way djokovic wa serving  <BRK> nothing worked  <BRK> djokovic led early in every stanza and never looked back  there wa no tension  the match wa shorter   minute than saturday s stirring woman s final between naomi osaka and petra kvitova  which also unfolded in three set but wa blessed tension at every turn  <BRK>  for me  one of the most important objective for the match wa to start off well and bring the intensity and make sure that he also feel my presence   said djokovic  who looked remarkably calm and centered  both during the match and afterward   he always make sure that the opponent across the net feel his presence  that is how he play  that s how he behaves  he brings so much energy  jumping around  sprinting  <BRK>  it wa crucial for me to start off with an early break  having a set under my belt just made me relax a bit more  not really worry too much  after that  it wa smooth   <BRK> smooth  perfect summary  <BRK> it wa a rare lopsided grand slam final between men s tennis great  reminiscent of nadal s wipeout of federer at the   french open and john mcenroe s rout of jimmy connors at wimbledon in    <BRK> but it should not be forgotten how far the two came to get to the final  the hurdle overcome  there is nadal with his injury  which have piled up over the year  especially on hard court  there is djokovic with the way he struggled with his confidence and his health after winning the french open in    for two full tennis seaon  it felt a if he wa lost in the wilderness  in match including a fourth round loss at melbourne park lat year to the unseeded south korean hyeon chung  <BRK> djokovic underwent elbow surgery not long after that match  at first  the operation did not help his on court result  he appeared to be a doubting and unhappy shadow of his self  improbably  he found his game on the wimbledon grass  winning the title there and then following that up with another championship at the u s  open in september  <BRK> according to the international tennis federation  djokovic is the first man to record three streak of three or more grand slam title in a row  he won four straight from wimbledon in   to the   french open  and three in a row from wimbledon in   to the   australian open  <BRK> his chance to hold all four major title at the same time will come in four month at the french open  which he ha won only once  nadal ha been the champion at roland garros   time   <BRK> sustain this level through the united state open  and it is not impossible to imagine him winning a calendar year grand slam  no man ha done that since rod laver in    <BRK> and what about reaching federer s record   grand slam title  <BRK> asked about those milestone on sunday  djokovic wa his typically reflective self  <BRK>  i am aware that making history of the sport that i truly love is something special   he said  <BRK> he then gave a nod to the kind of uncertainty that he know very well  firsthand  the way injury and loss of confidence can shake the very best of foundation  there are no sure bet  <BRK>  how many season are to come  i don t know   he added  noting that he wa trying hard not to get too far ahead of himself   i do want to definitely focus myself on continuing to improve so i would be able to compete at such a high level for the year to come   and have a shot at eventually getting closer to roger s record  <BRK>  it s still far   <BRK> true  but if he keep playing in the fluid  focused way he did on this sunday evening in melbourne    grand slam will come into focus soon enough  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
