 <BRK>  <BRK> by kurt streeter <BRK> melbourne  australia   simona halep of romania is ranked no    in the world in woman s tennis  last season  she won her first grand slam title  on the red clay of roland garros  <BRK> on monday night at melbourne park  she faced an opponent who  if judged the numerical listing spit out the pro tour s computer  should have been handled halep with relative ease  except that player  currently ranked  th in the world  is no slouch  that player  in fact  is serena williams  pure greatness in fishnet tights  <BRK> halep versus williams in the round of   wa a rare moment in tennis  it wa a match in which the top ranked player wa also the decided underdog  not only wa halep facing a formidable opponent with   major title  seven of them in melbourne alone  but she wa also confronting someone who had dominated their career head to head matchup  winning eight time and losing just once  <BRK> so it wa hardly a shock that williams ended up improving that record on monday  rolling past the   year old halep a               score  <BRK> in the quarterfinal  williams will now face seventh seeded karolina pliskova of the czech republic  who easily defeated garbi√±e muguruza of spain            to advance  williams ha beaten pliskova twice in three match  but the one loss came in the united state open semifinal in    pliskova  meanwhile  ha won all nine match she ha played this season  williams will be the lower ranked player when they meet but is again the actual favorite  <BRK>  i have to return better  but i will be ready   williams vowed a she looked ahead to pliskova   she s ready  i m ready  let s do it   <BRK> it wa vintage serena confidence  and it also stood in contrast to her demeanor at the very beginning of her match against halep  in those opening moment  williams actually seemed shaky  she lost her first service game  the product of uncharacteristically poor shot making and a clunky double fault  <BRK> but in a flash  williams got going  playing with great precision  she continuously sent ball deep and into corner  often for winner  <BRK> game after game flew  six straight in all decided in williams s favor  at the age of    she simply did not allow her younger opponent to find her rhythm  total time for the opening set    minute  <BRK>  i felt like i d been hit a train   halep would say later  <BRK>  i played really good   williams said when asked about that first set  she spoke in a plain  matter of fact tone  <BRK> a question came   were those six straight game the best you had played since coming back last year after the baby wa born   <BRK>  i don t know   she replied   but probably   <BRK> still  halep is among the most tenacious fighter in tennis  and a the match progressed  she began extending the rally  which is more to her liking and style  she began serving better  fending off williams s attack  <BRK>  i felt that my level is growing   halep said afterward   and i had more confidence   <BRK> and after capturing the second set  there wa a brief period in the third when halep appeared to have williams on the rope  williams looked fatigued  her movement slower and le sure  but midway through that final set  williams fended off three crucial break point  in the last  she pinned halep into a corner and blasted a backhand winner down the line  <BRK> a happens so often in tennis  halep had trouble bouncing back from missing such an important opening  and a happens so often when williams seems to be in trouble  she broke serve in the next game  seizing control with a string of strong baeline reply  <BRK> when the last game of the match arrived  halep offered meager resistance  williams had prevailed again  total time    hour   minute  <BRK> afterward  halep wa asked about the dynamic of taking on williams  and whose confidence should have been higher when the match began  <BRK>  you are ranked no     and she is serena williams   the questioner began before halep politely cut him off  <BRK>  exactly   she said  <BRK> that one word response said it all  for halep and for all of the woman not named serena who end up at the top of the computer ranking so long a she is playing  <BRK> williams now seems to be closing in on her old form after taking time off following the   birth of her daughter  even with that layoff  williams still made the final at wimbledon and the u s  open last year  at the u s  open  she lost the final to naomi osaka in a swirl of controversy and accusation of sexism  <BRK> williams is on a collision course with osaka again  seeded fourth in melbourne  osaka advanced to the quarterfinal with a               victory over anastasija sevastova on monday  osaka next play sixth seeded elina svitolina and could face williams in the semifinal  <BRK> williams s goal is clear and right there for the taking  if she win her next three match  she win her  th grand slam title  at last equaling the australian great margaret court s total of major single championship  <BRK> will she  <BRK> her coach  patrick mouratoglou  offered the strongest assessment  <BRK>  i believe she will   he said   she is ready physically  i think emotionally  too   <BRK>  she is back   he added   to being serena   <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
