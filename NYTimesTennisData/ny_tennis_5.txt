determined to have the best next act she could after a lengthy intermission during which she became the face of depression among athlete  <BRK>  it s easy to get caught up in the moment  just going from tournament to tournament now   marino said   but if i stop and think about it  then that s when i see that it s pretty cool that i wa able to do this  and to get this far  from no ranking to suddenly in the qualies of a slam   <BRK> marino lost            to caroline dolehide on tuesday in the first round of australian open qualifying  limited a back injury  which curtailed her off season training  despite her stiffness  marino     showed flash of the power and clean ball striking that sent her into the upper echelon of tennis seven year ago  <BRK> with a percussive forehand and a booming serve that topped out at   mile per hour  marino surged to a high of  th in the ranking in the summer of    when she wa    not a highly touted junior prospect  she had planned to enroll in college before her tennis success mounted  catapulting her faster and further than she wa prepared to handle  <BRK>  not expecting it  i felt like i wa thrown into this machine  and i didn t understand how it worked   she said  <BRK> marino stepped back from the sport for the first time in    taking seven month off  after returning for several month  she retired in february   at age    <BRK> in a conference call announcing her decision  marino revealed her struggle with depression  day earlier  she had discussed her social medium abuse in an interview with the new york time  her leaving the sport wa often attributed to one of those factor  or both of them  which marino said wa inaccurate in retrospect  <BRK>  when i look back  i wouldn t necessarily say it wa depression   she said of her decision to stop playing   it wa burnout  and it wa expectation put on my shoulder myself and others  and i just wan t able to cope  it kind of all came to a head in a big  giant burnout  i guess   <BRK> though her absence wa longer than most  marino is not the only player to have stepped away from the sport because of burnout  most notably  the top australian ash barty took off nearly two year early in her career  barty ha become a top player in her return  and she defeated no    simona halep in sydney this week  <BRK> for marino  stepping away from tennis made her  able to become superhappy and enjoy my life   she said   <BRK> marino s retirement at   generated considerable attention  particularly in her native canada  where she wa one of the brightest tennis prospect in generation   <BRK> her story resonated with others  but she felt uneasy being a touchstone for athlete struggling with depression   <BRK>  it wan t something i wa prepared for  and it s still something i m kind of grappling with   marino said   i m still a really private person  and so for people to come up to me and tell me all of the thing they ve dealt with  or how i ve affected them  it s difficult sometimes  because i don t really know what to say  even though i m happy that i ve helped people  it can be overwhelming because i m not professionally trained to help people   <BRK> after retiring from tennis  marino worked one summer for her family s construction business  pouring cement and digging through clay  she later began teaching tennis lesson and enrolled at the university of british columbia  where she studied english literature  the work she enjoyed most  she said  were one from the victorian era that grappled with the effect of industrialization on society  <BRK> in her second year  the university s rowing coach recruited her to join the team  knowing her athletic background and her family s extensive history in the sport   her uncle george hungerford wa an olympic gold medalist in     rowing improved marino s fitness and helped expand her sense of identity  <BRK>  to have a competitive outlet through a team like that wa superfun   she said   it made me feel like i wa a part of the university community  people didn t look at me for my tennis anymore  they just looked at me a a student athlete   <BRK> marino wa shaken in february   when her father  joe  received a prostate cancer diagnosis  <BRK>  after he finished chemo  i kind of took a step back and wanted to look at what wa important in my life   she said   i didn t want to live with any regret  and i thought that tennis wa the one thing in my life that i kind of wish i had a do over for   <BRK> she also wanted her father to see her play again  marino weighed the idea of a return for month and gained confidence after serving a a hitting partner at a tournament in vancouver  her hometown  in august     <BRK> a week before her next semester wa to begin  marino pulled out of her class  quit her coaching job and moved to montreal to begin working toward a full fledged comeback at tennis canada s training center  <BRK> after a false start because she did not re enter tennis s antidoping program in time  marino returned to the sport at it lowest rung last january  at a series of small tournament in turkey  she won her first   match  including her first   set  she worked throughout the year to bring her ranking to it current spot of  th  which wa enough to reach her goal of entering the australian open qualifying draw  <BRK> marino plan a long stay in the sport this time  and is working to ensure it is more pleasant and sustainable  she stay in better contact with friend  including more trip home to vancouver  to help her keep one foot outside the sometimes suffocating tennis bubble  <BRK>  my friend don t play tennis  so they don t care if i win or lose   she said   they re just concerned about how i m doing a a person  if i m enjoying myself  and when i ll be back so we can hang out  my whole structure this time around is a little bit different  and i have a lot of thing outside of tennis that keep me grounded   <BRK> she added   previously  i felt like my identity wa just  tennis player   but now i have many thing that form my identity  and i feel like i m very whole and very balanced   <BRK> marino hope her triumph off and on the court gain the same amount of attention a her rough time did  she want people to see her a a real person instead of a headline  <BRK>  i have no doubt in my mind that i m able to compete and be here   marino said   i m not going to ever go back to that place again because i know who i am now  and i know what i need to do   <BRK>  <BRK>
