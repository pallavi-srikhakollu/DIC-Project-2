 <BRK>  <BRK> by karen crouse <BRK> melbourne  australia   what better way to kick off australia day weekend than with a win one  get no    free special at melbourne park  <BRK> that will be the holiday bargain on offer inside rod laver arena on saturday when petra kvitova and naomi osaka square off in the australian open woman s final for the daphne akhurst memorial cup and the top spot in the woman s world ranking  <BRK> kvitova  a two time wimbledon titlist from the czech republic  advanced with a              defeat of the american danielle collins in the first of thursday s semifinal  osaka  the reigning united state open champion  engineered a               victory over kvitova s compatriot karolina pliskova  who described osaka s play a  unbelievable  and said   there wa not much that i could do   <BRK> osaka     can become the first japanese single player  male or female  to hold the no    ranking  a piece of history that seemed well beyond her grasp last year at this time when she entered the tournament ranked no     <BRK>  of course that s a very big deal for me   osaka said  adding   i m just really happy that i m in the position that i am now  and i m not going to take it for granted   <BRK> kvitova  who rose a high a no    in    didn t know that no    wa within her reach here   i don t really care  to be honest   she said  <BRK> pointing to her head  she added   i don t think there s any room here to think about it   <BRK> she feel especially blessed to be playing for another major title  this is her first grand slam final since she fought off a knife wielding burglar in her czech republic apartment in    she sustained nerve and tendon damage in all five finger of her dominant left hand in the attack  requiring hour of surgery to repair and sidelining her from competition for five month  <BRK>  i didn t know even if i wa going to play tennis again   kvitova said  adding   it wan t only physically but mentally wa very tough  a well  it took me really long while to believe   <BRK> since returning for her self described  second career  at the   french open  the   year old kvitova ha won seven tournament  including five last year  <BRK> the power game will be on display in this year s woman s u  s  open final when two of the hardest hitter in the game  serena williams and naomi osaka  square off  it will be the first grand slam final for osaka who ha burst onto the scene with one of the most powerful forehand in woman s tennis  <BRK> she started   on a high note  prevailing in the tuneup event in sydney  but for all her success  she had struggled in the major  after winning wimbledon for the second time in    kvitova didn t advance to the semifinal in her next   grand slam  her best showing wa two quarterfinal appearance at the u s  open  <BRK>  for the mental side  it wasn t really easy to kind of deal with that every time  coming to the grand slam and losing   kvitova said   maybe that s why it s probably more sweet   <BRK> osaka may be in her second consecutive major final  but she can remember when making it to the second week wa a major victory  before her breakthrough against serena williams lat year in flushing meadow  osaka lost in the third round of grand slam seven time and got a far a the fourth round only once  <BRK>  man  for me it feel like it took awhile   osaka said  laughing  she added   maybe my time go slower than your time  but definitely i remember all the match that i lost in the third round   <BRK> osaka used to become easily frustrated  the biggest change that her coach  sascha bajin  ha noticed in this tournament is that she is controlling her emotion better when point don t go her way  <BRK>  i just have to tell her grass is green  water flow and everything is all right sometimes   bajin said   over all  she s very hard on herself  she ha very high expectation  she want to do well  she want to get better   <BRK> kvitova wa the same age that osaka is now when she claimed her maiden wimbledon crown  in    back then  her career stretched before her like a clear ribbon of highway  sure  there were a few pothole  but nothing she couldn t get past  then came the attack in her apartment  <BRK> kvitova said she found out only recently that in the early month of her recovery  her doctor wasn t optimistic about her returning to competitive tennis  <BRK>  luckily he didn t tell me  like  during that period   kvitova said  <BRK> last summer  kvitova met monica seles  who arranged the introduction   it wa such a nice feeling to meet someone who kind of went through same thing and thought and everything   kvitova said of seles  who wa stabbed a spectator during a match in    <BRK> seles returned to competition  and won the australian open in   for her ninth major championship  <BRK>  i didn t know that  actually   kvitova said   it s nice then   <BRK> whatever happens saturday  kvitova feel a if she ha already won   to be honest  i think not very many people believe that i can do that again  to stand on the court and play tennis and kind of play on this level   <BRK> an earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of the woman
