 <BRK>  <BRK> by ben rothenberg <BRK> melbourne  australia   after  th ranked christopher eubanks made it through the qualifying draw of a grand slam event for the first time last week  many of his friend from back in atlanta began to grasp how far his career had come  <BRK> it wa not because of the three qualifying match he had won  but rather because of who joined him for a practice before the australian open began  serena williams  <BRK>  some of my friend who don t really know tennis were saying   if he s hitting with serena  he must be pretty good     eubanks said  <BRK> his session with her wa part of a new strategy for williams  who is training with some of the best current player from the men s tour to raise the intensity of her practice  in addition to eubanks  williams ha practiced this month with no    stefanos tsitsipas  no    grigor dimitrov  no    france tiafoe and no    bernard tomic  <BRK> asked about her practice with such player  williams said simply   it wa fun   but her coach  patrick mouratoglou  wa more loquacious  <BRK>  if she lift her level on a daily basis that much  she s going to improve incredibly   he said  <BRK> the early return from the strategy have been positive  williams beat eugenie bouchard            in the second round on thursday night  thwarting the resurgent canadian with sharp  focused aggression  williams wa particularly strong on her return  winning   percent of point on bouchard s serve  <BRK> mouratoglou said the shift to finding the best male opposition available wa  a long term plan   not a temporary trend  <BRK>  i think that it s very important in your practice to be challenged  because i think that she can become much better than what she is already   mouratoglou said   but in order to become better  if you re not challenged  you have no chance  i thought that to be challenged at practice wa a good idea  so we tried once and we really loved it   <BRK> that first try  mouratoglou said  wa with the australian player thanasi kokkinakis last year at mouratoglou s academy in france  <BRK>  she said   wow  it wa great  great rhythm  and it s tough  it push me     mouratoglou said   i thought she played incredible   <BRK> kokkinakis  who had beaten roger federer earlier that spring at the miami open  shared that assessment  marveling at his inability to push williams back from her position on the baseline even with his hardest  heaviest shot  <BRK>  she s so  so strong on the ball   he said   when i thought i hit some good shot that even some male player might even struggle with  she took it on the rise  handled it pretty well   <BRK> williams ha practiced with men throughout her career  usually employing a man a a full time hitting partner  most have been year removed from their active day on tour and had achieved modest ranking  her longtime hitting partner sacha bajin peaked at  th  his successor  robbye poole  reached  th  her current hitting partner  jarmere jenkins  reached a high of  th  <BRK> mouratoglou said that jenkins wa  still hitting the ball really well   but that it wa important to shake williams out of her routine with him when possible  <BRK>  she basically know where he s going to hit in advance  because she hit with him every day  so there is no surprise   mouratoglou said   she doesn t feel that she s challenged because she know him too well  i think that count a lot  and she control him  in a way  because he s her employee  even unconsciously  she make him play the way she want to  even if she doesn t try to  <BRK>  so it s completely different relationship with a professional player  because she ha to give him good rhythm  to give a good ball to him  too  so she can t lose focus   <BRK> other top men and woman have shared practice court in the first month of the tennis season  andy murray and naomi osaka  for example  hit together for   minute at a tournament in brisbane  australia  <BRK> mouratoglou said that he emphasized to the men that they should not treat williams differently from any other practice partner  <BRK> he said he told eubanks   play for yourself   it s your practice   <BRK> eubanks said the session with williams helped him in his first round loss monday against  th seeded nikoloz basilashvili  eubanks had set point to go up two set to one on a player ranked   spot ahead of him  <BRK>  serena hit  in my opinion  one of the cleanest ball in the history of tennis   eubanks said   i wa working on absorbing pace  because she put enough pace on it that you re really working the leg  i m being a professional a i can  because you re on the court with serena williams  you don t want her to think you can t play   <BRK> eubanks said he felt the effect of williams s intensity and skill the rest of the day  <BRK>  i practiced again in the evening  and i told my coach i felt like i did a lift today  because my quad are so sore from just hitting with her for an hour   he said  <BRK> after williams s victory over bouchard  the on court interviewer jim courier joked that she should charge the men she hit with for lesson  indeed  many of williams s past practice partner have been thriving in melbourne  tsitsipas  tiafoe and alexei popyrin have reached the third round at the open for the first time  <BRK>  just to hit with a legend  especially serena  it really gave me a great  great experience   popyrin said after no    dominic thiem retired from their second round match thursday   she gave me some tip after the hit  so it wa great   <BRK> tiafoe  whom williams hit with several time while they were teammate at the hopman cup  had his best career victory on wednesday when he beat fifth seeded kevin anderson in the second round  <BRK> tiafoe said he had difficulty handling williams s zipping shot  a he wa more used to the spinning shot male player tend to use  <BRK>  i wa struggling   tiafoe said of hitting with williams   she hit the ball so hard  the court are fast  it wa skidding  i mean  a little topspin  maybe  i m not used to the ball coming in that flat  that wa something i really had to adjust to   <BRK> mouratoglou said no man had turned down an offer to hit with williams  <BRK>  and i don t think any will say no   he said   it s a great experience for them  too  and i think they re curious how serena is hitting  for real   <BRK> for eubanks  williams s story had particular resonance  his father coached him in atlanta following many of the tactic and philosophy of serena s father  richard williams  <BRK>  being able to see somebody who come from humble beginning  somebody who ha dealt with adversity her entire life  seeing someone who come from an unconventional tennis background  it show it can be done   he said  <BRK>  i ve gotten to the point now where i don t really get star struck when i see people   he added   i ve practiced with fed a couple time  i ve seen novak  seen rafa  you see them and understand that they re people  but serena  there s something about her that s almost larger than life  so when i got out there and she said my name  it took me back to a if i wa a little kid   man  serena williams know my name     <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
