 <BRK>  <BRK> by karen crouse <BRK> melbourne  australia   ann chisholm contemplated traveling from her minnesota home to watch the main draw debut of her cousin danielle collins at the australian open  but it seemed like a flight of fancy  collins had lost in the first round of the three major she played last year  and it made little sense for a relative to travel     mile to see what might be only one match  <BRK> but chisholm continued monitoring airfare after each of collins s first three match in melbourne  all victory  then  in the fourth round  the unseeded collins defeated angelique kerber  the   champion and this year s no    seed  <BRK> it wa just past   on saturday night in grand rapid  minn   when collins sealed the upset  and chisholm s inner voice  which had been nagging her for a week to hop on a plane  grew so loud she could hardly sleep  <BRK> on sunday morning  chisholm reached out to collins and said she wa looking at flight to australia  chisholm didn t want her arrival to surprise collins in case  she said  it  messed up her mojo   <BRK> after collins reacted enthusiastically  chisholm  who ha four child  asked her husband and her mother if they would watch over thing at home if she went away for a few day  then she called a delta air line reservation agent  who pieced together a trip from minneapolis to san diego  then on to los angeles that would deliver her to melbourne on tuesday morning  <BRK> chisholm had about five minute to pack for her journey to the southern hemisphere  not enough time to retrieve summer clothes from storage  so she threw some shirt and pant into a suitcase  and when her family left for church  she left for australia  <BRK> the trip went off without a hitch  and a few hour after landing here in melbourne  chisholm wa in collins s player box at rod laver arena  transmitting positive vibe down to the court during collins s               win over anastasia pavlyuchenkova  <BRK> with the victory  collins     earned a semifinal meeting against petra kvitova  the eighth seed and a two time wimbledon champion  who recently beat collins in three set in the first round of a tuneup event in brisbane  <BRK>  i feel like i m representing the whole family   chisholm said  <BRK> in st  petersburg  fla   cathy collins  a preschool teacher  managed a few hour  sleep before her alarm went off a little after midnight  in time for her to watch television coverage of her daughter s match  collins s father  walter  a landscaper  waited until after the match to sleep  taking what amounted to a power nap before starting work  <BRK> the house where her parent live is the only place collins ha called home  some of the neighbor have known her since she wa born  a couple that life across the street ha been running over to celebrate every win with collins s parent  <BRK>  when the doorbell ring in the middle of the night  we know who it is   cathy collins said telephone  <BRK> it wa a quarter to   on tuesday morning  and collins s mother would soon be corralling more than a dozen preschooler  she had gone back to bed when her daughter s match wa over  and woke up wondering if the victory had been a technicolor dream  <BRK>  it s weird   cathy collins said   it s like   is my daughter really in the semifinal    <BRK> on the other side of the world  collins described her father a  the hardest worker i know  and marveled at her mother s stamen  <BRK>  i don t know how my mom is managing   collins said   she s not getting more than four or five hour of sleep on these match night  and she s dealing with     year old  she s a trooper   <BRK> so is collins  who wa ranked  th in the world coming into this tournament with an     record in grand slam match  she seems unfazed  <BRK> at collins s post match news conference tuesday  a longtime tennis journalist from europe began a question saying   i hope you understand that we are used to meeting player when they re kid  you are different from our point of view   <BRK> he went on to compliment her maturity  which collins attribute to a route le taken  her family couldn t afford the elite academy and junior circuit that mold small child into young professional  so she went to college on an athletic scholarship to get her seasoning  <BRK> she started at the university of florida  then transferred to the university of virginia  collins won two n c a a  single title while earning a degree in medium study and making lifelong friend  many of them non athlete  <BRK>  i think not being a child prodigy  not being a superstar at a young age  certainly humbled me  made me in a way work harder for thing   collins said  adding   i think it s kind of made me hungrier in some way  like not having that   oh  i ve alway been really amazing at tennis   it wasn t alway like that   <BRK> collins come across a feisty   her mother said she d had  a fighting spirit  since childhood  collins also ooze confidence  regardless of circumstance  <BRK> one of her favorite course at virginia wa denise stewart s introduction to drama  <BRK>  one of the thing she taught u is sometimes you ve got to go to your job and you ve got to sit in that cubicle when you don t want to for eight hour and fake it till you make it   collins said   and so much of life is acting  you ve got to always have a positive mind set   <BRK> stewart said she wa not surprised that collins had found the big stage  her success  she said  transcends tennis  <BRK>  she is such the right woman at this time to say   humble is not my jam    stewart said
