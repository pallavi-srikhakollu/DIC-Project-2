over to a waist high fence where fan were packed   deep to watch him and hoisted a boy from the front of the crowd over the barricade and onto the court  <BRK> that boy    year old novak pokrajac  then got to play a few point with the man for whom he wa named  including a   shot rally that ended with him hitting an overhead smash past djokovic for a winner  <BRK> both novaks are back at melbourne park this year   djokovic     is seeking his seventh australian open title and  th grand slam trophy  and pokrajac     is hoping to entice djokovic into a practice court rematch  <BRK> for the ten of thousand of australian of serbian descent  djokovic is the secular saint of sport  worshiped serb who still feel an acute sense of persecution nearly two decade after the worst of the balkan  fractious ethnic violence  that wa evident on wednesday afternoon  when djokovic hit with the australian teenager alexei popyrin in front of a crowd that included about a dozen fan flying the red  blue and white color of the serbian flag   <BRK> even during the   week of the year when the melbourne park court go quiet  djokovic s presence loom  in the office off the serbian voice  a weekly newspaper on the western edge of melbourne  one wall serf a a shrine to celebrated serbian figure from history  serbian orthodox church figure  vuk karadzic  the creator of the serbian cyrillic alphabet  nikola tesla  the serbian american inventor  and djokovic   <BRK> for serbia  a nation of seven million people  it is  a big deal  to be able to claim the top ranked player in men s tennis   and one of the best ever   said zeljko prodanovic  the newspaper s editor  <BRK>  after the war  it s not so easy to say   here we are    he said   you look at the movie  serb are always the bad guy  but now we can say we have the best tennis player in the world  that make u proud   <BRK> the newspaper s owner  zivana jovanovic  ha welcomed several serbian luminary to her office in her two decade at the helm  including the actor dragan nikolic and the retired n b a  player vlade divac  she ha never met djokovic but said she felt a if she know him because of his high profile  for all his fame  jovanovic said  djokovic come across a humble   <BRK>  i like that about him   she said   he hasn t let all his success go to his head   <BRK> djokovic s celebrity status ha made it hard for him to move freely in public in melbourne  but in his younger day he had regular haunt  a church where he would ring in the orthodox new year  or the restaurant on lygon street  known for it outdoor cafe and european eatery  now  though  when djokovic venture out into the city  a he did before the tournament for a photo opportunity for one of his sponsor  he is swarmed admirer  <BRK> still  djokovic said he try to meet and chat with serb wherever he go and invite them to watch him play  <BRK>  i guess it nurture the culture and tradition   he said   me a one of the athlete from our country that is internationally successful  i feel there is also a responsibility to represent the country in a right way  for a lot of those people  especially who live here  they have not seen or been to serbia for a long time  so for them it s quite a treat to have me playing here and other tennis player from serbia   <BRK> michael popovic  a middle aged serb who emigrated from belgrade to melbourne in his  s  wa at rod laver arena in   when djokovic defeated roger federer in the semifinal to reach the final  where he would defeat jo wilfried tsonga for his first major title   <BRK>  the feeling i had at that moment wa very hard to describe   said popovic  a restaurateur   it wa like i just won   <BRK> popovic owns mediterraneo  a restaurant on a quiet street in an upscale neighborhood south of the city center that specializes in steak and seafood  the restaurant also offer vegan and gluten free dish    because of novak   popovic said  referring to djokovic s decision several year ago to overhaul his diet  <BRK>  i serve serbian burger with no bread crumb   popovic added   that wa novak s influence  also   <BRK> but the only djokovic whom popovic ha served is novak s uncle goran   somehow i ve never had the pleasure of having novak here   he said  <BRK> that nearly changed lat weekend  when a large party of serb   including the pro janko tipsarevic  who every year distributes tournament ticket to the local serbian community through one of his friend   stopped in for dinner  djokovic wa supposed to join them  but long after they had been seated  they received a text from him saying they should eat without him because he wa stuck in meeting related to his responsibility a the president of the atp player council  <BRK>  it wa a pity   popovic said   i wa really hoping he would come   <BRK> on monday  pokrajac  the young fan  made sure he wouldn t miss djokovic  arriving at melbourne park with his mother  snezana  more than an hour before the player wa scheduled to practice  he wanted to claim a prime viewing spot  up against the fence again  the night before  pokrajac said  he had imagined getting to hit again with djokovic  borrowing a technique that ha served him well in his match  <BRK>  if i visualize something before   pokrajac said   then it will happen   <BRK> after djokovic finished practicing  pokrajac shouted   remember me  novak  i m here from perth   <BRK> djokovic remembered  he came over  hoisted pokrajac over the fence again  handed him a racket  and they began to hit  they played four  point   the second rally wa   shot  the fourth ended on the  th  when pokrajac hit a half volley for a winner  <BRK> his prize wa a hug and a signed t shirt from djokovic  who also offered a tip on how to return a slice  <BRK>  he told me to get lower   pokrajac said  <BRK> two day later  pokrajac staked out his same spot  he unfurled a serbian flag that he had signed and which he intended to present to djokovic a a parting gift  after his session  djokovic came over and accepted the flag  he read what pokrajac had written   to novak from novak from perth   under his signature pokrajac had written   it s going to be worth gold money  and added a smiley face  <BRK> djokovic hugged him  a pokrajac turned to rejoin his mother  his smile wa incandescent  <BRK>  i feel like i know him   pokrajac said   i think we re going to be friend
