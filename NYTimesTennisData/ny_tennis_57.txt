 <BRK>  <BRK> by kurt streeter <BRK> melbourne  australia   early in his quarterfinal match at the australian open on tuesday  france tiafoe  part of a new generation of male star who have emerged for the first time at a grand slam tournament  faced a break point against his battle tested opponent  <BRK> but rafael nadal  of course  is not just any opponent  he is the no    seed  a champion in melbourne in    the owner of   grand slam title and a punishing a player a ever at age    <BRK> nadal s return of serve came back powerfully  pushing the   year old tiafoe far to his backhand side for a meager reply  and with that  nadal  a he did during the entire span of a vintage and coldly efficient victory  had put his opponent on an energy sapping  confidence draining string  <BRK> the exchange ended  mercifully  with a booming nadal down the line forehand  which the powerfully built tiafoe sent meekly into the net  <BRK> two game into a much anticipated fight  tiafoe s serve had been broken  his fighting spirit dealt a severe blow  <BRK> after winning that first break point  nadal never looked back  roughly   minute later  the scoreboard flashed the result                 <BRK> earlier  another rising star had done what tiafoe could not  beating his elder to reach the semifinal  stefanos tsitsipas  a   year old from greece  defeated the   year old spaniard  roberto bautista agut                          several hour before nadal and tiafoe took the court  <BRK> but with nadal s win at rod laver arena  a measure of order wa restored a member of the old guard  <BRK> buoyant on court after the match  nadal told the crowd that he had recently joked that the tour s young challenger could wait awhile before challenging for tennis supremacy  <BRK>  but look that they don t want to wait   he said   they are there  no   <BRK> in this tournament  nadal ha also beaten alex de minaur  the   year old new hope of australia  in the semifinal on thursday  he will play tsitsipas  <BRK> tsitsipa  seeded  th and the first greek player to make a serious dent in the pro game  is among the clutch of college age player heralded the atp tour a eventual successor to the four aging king of the sport  nadal  novak djokovic  roger federer and andy murray  who have won virtually every grand slam single title since    <BRK> they will not be able to defy time forever  cae in point  murray  the three time major champion  a former no    and a two time olympic gold medalist  announced at the start of this tournament that his day a a player may end at this year s wimbledon  if not sooner  <BRK>  it feel like a fairytale   tsitsipas said in a post match interview  <BRK> a he spoke  inside the stadium and out  rowdy fan  many from melbourne s large greek population  chanted song and danced   a they have all tournament long  <BRK> with his flowing lock and scythe like  one handed backhand  tsitsipas had proved himself a legitimate threat to win here when he blunted federer on center stage sunday night  <BRK> the upset  got people s attention   he said   my biggest challenge wa to stay concentrated  stay focused  in order to prove the win over federer wa no fluke  <BRK> tiafoe   known a  big foe   and one of the few black player on tour   could not come close to duplicating tsitsipa s effort  before playing nadal  the young american seemed to be playing with the form and confidence that would give him a chance for a monumental upset of his own  he had scored three straight surprising win against higher ranked player  including one over the no    seed  kevin anderson  he had also gained an avid following with his vivacious on court persona and post match celebration   taking off his shirt and pounding his chest  mimicking his favorite n b a  player  <BRK> his hope against nadal wa that his young leg would push him past a champion who ha won   tour title in a career of nearly two decade  <BRK> add to that  maybe  just maybe  nadal would break down on the unforgiving hard court  a surface that ha taken a toll on his body  <BRK> after all  nadal completed just one hard court event last year  at the australian open  he retired during the fifth set of his quarterfinal against marin cilic  because of an upper leg injury  at the united state open in september  he retired again  this time because of a knee injury during a semifinal against juan mart√≠n del potro  <BRK> nadal took the rest of the year off and had ankle surgery  then  after he arrived in australia  he withdrew from a warm up event in brisbane because of a left thigh injury  <BRK> but at melbourne park this year  he look refreshed  his movement is fluid  his ball striking ha looked a crisp and powerful a ever  <BRK> tiafoe spoke to this  offering a view of what it s like from the distressed other side of the court  <BRK>  i knew he wa going to bring crazy intensity   tiafoe said   i knew the ball wa going to be jumping  <BRK>  i knew if he got hold of a forehand  it wa going to be barbecue chicken   he continued  resorting to a culinary metaphor to describe how he felt after just a few point  cooked  <BRK> keenly aware of how small the margin between winning and losing are at this level  nadal slightly altered his service motion during the off season  he cut down on his backswing to gain more efficient power  he said after tuesday s match that he had also worked on finishing point earlier than usual  to reduce the wear on his body  <BRK> there is still much tennis to be played in this tournament  novak djokovic  the firmly entrenched no    player  remains on the other side of the draw  he and nadal could meet in the final here for the second time  a rematch of    when djokovic won in a nearly six hour marathon  <BRK> but first thing first  and for nadal that mean facing tsitsipas  another chance for the old guard to keep a youthful challenger at bay  <BRK> want more autralia coverage and discusion  sign up for the weekly autralia
