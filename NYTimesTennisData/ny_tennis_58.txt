 <BRK>  <BRK> by ben rothenberg <BRK> melbourne  australia   top ranked simona halep expressed relief and satisfaction after her third round victory over venus williams on saturday night at the australian open  she also remained galvanized for the task ahead   a fourth round match on monday against venus s sister  serena  <BRK>  it s always a big challenge to play against the williams sister   halep said in her on court interview after her          victory over venus   so i wa super motivated today   a she will have to be on monday  <BRK>  definitely is the toughest draw i ve ever had   halep said  <BRK> though halep arrived at melbourne without a victory since august  she ha impressed in her first three match here   i think she played pretty flawless today   wa the assessment from venus williams after the match  <BRK> serena williams  meanwhile  easily won her third round match            over dayana yastremska   and then expressed eagerness for the chance to test herself against the no    ranked halep  <BRK>  i honestly would love to face the world no      said williams  adding that she han t faced a no    since her return from maternity leave last year  actually  williams ha actually not faced a no    player in nearly six year   largely because you can t be across the net from the no    when you are the no     <BRK> williams s last match against a top ranked player wa against victoria azarenka in february   in the doha final  though williams lost that match  she secured the no    ranking reaching the semifinal of that tournament and she then held onto it for   week  through the   u s  open  when she ceded it to angelique kerber  <BRK> despite her two run to grand slam final last year  williams ha not beaten many high profile opponent since her return  she is     against top   player in that span  with the lone victory coming last year against karolina pliskova in the united state open quarterfinal  <BRK> still  williams is considered the player to beat at every tournament she enters  and according to the player who ha spent the last   week atop the ranking  she s still the best in the world  <BRK>  in my opinion  to be no    in the world and to be the best player in the world  it s a little bit different   halep said   in this moment  i m no    in the world  so i will take that  i have been there many month  many week  <BRK>  but for sure she s the best player in the world because she won so many grand slam   halep added in reference to williams  who is a   time grand slam single champion   she s been a lot on no     i cannot compare my result to her  but in this moment  i am confident that i am in this position  and i m positive about it   <BRK> monday s blockbuster match is a product of a draw that ha been almost devoid of major upset  with seven of the top eight woman reaching the fourth round  no    caroline wozniacki lost to five time grand slam champion maria sharapova in the third round   <BRK> that steadiness the favorite represents an abrupt arrival of order to woman s grand slam tennis  at wimbledon last year  only one of the top eight reached the fourth round  at the united state open  only three did  <BRK> pliskova  the only player seeded in the top   to make the second week at the last three grand slam  could face the winner of the halep williams match in the quarterfinal  she is looking forward to which of the two it might be  <BRK>  for sure  the best match now in the draw   pliskova said  <BRK> the men have also had a steady ride to the round of    with six of the top eight seeded player reaching the second week  including the top four  <BRK> but those four all have tough challenge directly ahead of them  the top seeded player  novak djokovic  face no    daniil medvedev  whose ranking ha soared from no    since the beginning of last season  rafael nadal  who is seeded no     face resurgent veteran tomas berdych  who beat him in straight set here in    which wa their most recent meeting on hard court  <BRK> roger federer  seeded no     face no    stefanos tsitsipas  the young greek who won the atp s next gen competition in milan in november  and the player seeded no     alexander zverev  face no    milo raonic  who ha already knocked out nick kyrgios and stan wawrinka en route to the second week  <BRK> though all dangerous  none of those men face a challenge quite like the one that serena williams present to halep  halep is     against williams  with her lone win coming via a          blitz in the round robin stage of the   wta championship in singapore  williams avenged that loss            in the final day later  <BRK> halep said she would be used to the pressure of facing williams when they meet here on monday and hoped she would able to play the same sort of assertive  proactive tennis she deployed against venus  <BRK>  i m in a good position   she said   i feel confident  i played very well today  but doesn t mean it s going to be the same against her  i will wait  i will focus on myself   it s the most important thing   <BRK> and halep  who ha kept a markedly positive attitude throughout the tournament  said there would be something positive resulting from the match  regardless of the outcome   it s always great to play against serena   she said   because every time  i have something to learn   <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
