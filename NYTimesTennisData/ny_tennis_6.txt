expression of an event that ha brought the best men and best woman in tennis together for more than three decade  <BRK> but despite the power of seeing williams and federer on opposite side of the net  the future of the hopman cup is uncertain  with a new men s team event set to eclipse it  part of a trend of realignment and reinvention in tennis  tennis australia  which manages the hopman cup  will next year help organize the atp cup  a   day tournament that will have men s team from   country competing across three australian city for ranking point and    million in prize money  <BRK> with

s tennis could doom the coed hopman cup  the host city for the atp cup have not yet been announced  but the state of the art perth arena  where the hopman cup ha been held since    is a likely choice  even if perth is not chosen  it would be difficult to imagine tennis australia hosting two competing team event in the same week  <BRK> the hopman cup remains an oddity in it  st year  at once a playful exhibition that serf a a relaxing lead up to the australian open and  since    an officially sanctioned international tennis federation event  <BRK> the tournament ha been bankrolled the western australian government s tourism body  tourism w a  player appearance contract have included clause forbidding them from criticizing perth  and at time the programming can feel like an infomercial for the region  after his first match at this year s tournament  federer gave an on court interview that centered on his appreciation for the region and a photo shoot at a scenic rock formation nearby  <BRK> among local  the main concern is le about preserving the hopman cup and more about making sure that isolated perth  which is     mile from another city of more than     people  keep a foothold in tennis and is not left out of the pre australian open swing  <BRK> in the wider tennis community  the hopman cup s uniqueness is appreciated  it ha rarely sparked the tribal passion on which davis cup pride itself  but the hopman cup ha been a crowd pleasing event  cherished tennis fan who have savored the opportunity to see the sport s top woman and top men compete and commingle

who would never otherwise intersect  in the   final  the   foot   justine henin tried to return the booming serve of the   foot   john isner  <BRK> not everyone is ready to write an obituary for the event  though  david haggerty  president of the i t f   which sanction the hopman cup a it official mixed team competition  said the event wa  very  very important and should continue   <BRK> haggerty said he expected tennis australia to honor it remaining contractual obligation for managing the hopman cup in the first week of the season  which run through    <BRK>  we re just excited to continue to see hopman cup through because it is a great way to have the men and woman playing   said haggerty  who spearheaded a massive overhaul of the davis cup format last year despite strong resistance from governing body  including tennis australia  <BRK> if saturday s final wa the event s last gasp  it had a breathtaking finish  with federer and bencic prevailing in an   shot rally on a winner

for player relation  wa scouting perth arena a a potential venue for the atp cup  for which he will be managing director  hutchins is also visiting adelaide  brisbane and sydney  which all have existing tennis facility  <BRK>  ultimately we thought this time of year  leading into a grand slam  is important to do something major in  and that s what we will target   hutchins said   this event will be a major event on the atp tour   <BRK> the atp cup is landing in a jam packed first week of the tennis seaon  which this year ha seven tournament  the hopman cup  wta tournament in auckland  new zealand  and shenzhen  china  atp tournament in doha  qatar  and pune  india  and a combined atp wta tournament in brisbane  hutchins said only one of the atp event would remain on the schedule a a complement to the atp cup  with no survivor yet designated  <BRK> the atp is eager to add more event that it will own outright  the atp cup will be the third new annual men s team event introduced since    the federer backed laver cup  which pit a european team against one from the rest of the world  is held in september  the reworked   country davis cup will culminate in november  hutchins said he thought there wa room for all three to flourish  <BRK>  i don t think there is a fatigue of team event because it s not something that we think is diluted  and they re all slightly different   he said  <BRK> but there is nothing quite like the hopman cup on the horizon  without any fixed plan for the event s end or it continuation  player and organizer at this year s tournament participated
