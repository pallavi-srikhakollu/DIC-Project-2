 <BRK>  <BRK> by ravi ubha <BRK> after spending   rapidly ascending the global tennis rank  aryna sabalenka decided to spend some of her brief off season in free fall  so during a winter visit to dubai  sabalenka said  she took the opportunity to bungee jump from   floor up  <BRK>  these three second before you jump  it s like something unbelievable   sabalenka  a   year old belarusian  said in a recent telephone interview   you want to cry  smile and laugh   <BRK> the daring off seaon activity underscored the intensity and cheerfulness that came to define sabalenka a she burst onto the scene lat year  winning her first two wta title  <BRK>  she s always very friendly   said her coach  dmitry tursunov   she like to be in a good mood   <BRK> she also like to win  and she ha started where she left off after her breakthrough campaign  becoming the first wta titlist of   defeating alison riske                     in the final of the tournament in shenzhen  china  on saturday  <BRK> now sabalenka can add one more label  dark horse to win the australian open  where she could establish herself not just a an up and comer but a one of the sport s pacesetter  <BRK>  i m telling you here  right now  that the winner of the australian open woman s side is going to be sabalenka  o k    the espn analyst patrick mcenroe told reporter this week   she s going to win the australian open   <BRK> the title in shenzhen helped her return to a career best ranking of no    on the eve of the year s first grand slam tournament  and despite a stumble at her next tournament   a first round loss to eighth ranked petra kvitova in sydney   sabalenka s recent tear ha put her on more than one list of australian open favorite  <BRK>  if you look at the top   player  especially with her age  she is probably the most dangerous one right now because of the power   said sophie amiach  a former australian open quarterfinalist in single and double who is now an analyst for the wta s world feed  <BRK>  besides the given  serena  everybody else  the power is there  but i don t think it s a much a what she ha   amiach added  referring to serena williams  who is seeking to equal margaret court s record of   grand slam single title  <BRK> but the overwhelming force that ha fueled sabalenka s rise can also be difficult to harness at time  her serf and forehand can misfire yard  and her shot selection is sometime questionable  seesaw match proved a mainstay for sabalenka in    leading to a wta high   third set contested  <BRK> that inconsistency might have been what prompted a bit of criticism from president aleksandr g  lukashenko of belarus when he met sabalenka in november  <BRK>  i am happy with your performance   he wa quoted saying the news agency beita   except for several moment when the ball went out of court while you could keep it in the game   <BRK> but like her fellow rising star naomi osaka     sabalenka ha started to rein in her game while still blasting winner  it helped sabalenka  the only player to take a set off osaka during her run to the united state open title last fall  rise to no    the end of   after beginning the year ranked  rd  her eight win over top   player last year   all after june   placed her behind only kiki bertens and elina svitolina  <BRK> and sabalenka toppled svitolina  the eventual champion at the wta final in october  on the way to her biggest title  in wuhan  china  a month earlier  <BRK>  she is a quick learner  but i feel also she is a quick learner because she is passionate about it and want to do it   said tursunov  who used a similarly powerful style to win seven atp title in his career   and i think that kind of summarizes her improvement   <BRK> before he became sabalenka s coach during the summer gras court swing lat year  tursunov had already been impressed his future charge s performance and attitude a he observed her on tour  <BRK> at lat year s tournament in indian well  calif   tursunov looked on a the player he wa then coaching  elena vesnina  faced sabalenka and her countrywoman victoria azarenka in a double match with ekaterina makarova  vesnina and makarova  the tournament s top seed  prevailed            <BRK>  she didn t get fazed when she wa being rifled at   tursunov said   and a few time they were just going at her and knocked her down on her butt  she wa kind of sitting and giggling   <BRK> he added   those are the thing that just kind of stuck in my mind  the way she wa handling tough situation  and situation where she wa being outplayed   <BRK> sabalenka attribute some of that mental toughness to her root in belarus  money wa scarce  so she did not compete in any junior grand slam event and participated in just four tournament outside europe  <BRK>  i could play tennis  but no one believed in me that much   sabalenka said   actually i think this kind of thing helped me to improve my game  <BRK>  before  i wa actually upset with it  they think i am not the best player  and it made me work extra hard and improve my game   <BRK> it wa with the belarusian fed cup team  however  that sabalenka emerged on the broader scene  in    belarus advanced to the final  with sabalenka and aliaksandra sasnovich falling to the american shelby rogers and coco vandeweghe in the deciding double match in minsk  <BRK> even a her ranking climb and her goal become loftier  sabalenka said she did not intend to skip the fed cup series  her energy seems to resonate throughout the squad  <BRK>  she is always fighting  so when playing on a team with her  you just cannot go down  because you are just getting involved in this flow she creates   vera lapko  her fellow   year old belarusian  said in an email  <BRK> neither that grit nor the smile will escape sabalenka anytime soon  <BRK>  i m smiling and laughing   she said   i don t want to be too serious because this is not me   <BRK> because of an editing error  an earlier version of this article misstated the result of a match between aryna sabalenka and kiki bertens in fed cup in    sabalenka held a match point against bertens  she did not win the match  and the match wa in the first round  not the semifinal  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
