 <BRK>  <BRK> by ben rothenberg <BRK> melbourne  australia   serena williams wa one point from the australian open semifinal when she lost her footing and the match slipped away  <BRK> williams  who wa seeking a record tying  th grand slam single title  lost the final six game to fall                 to karolina pliskova on wednesday  relinquishing her lead after rolling her left ankle when the match wa within her reach  <BRK>  i wa almost in the locker room  but now i m standing here a a winner   pliskova said in her on court interview after the match   so it s a really good feeling   <BRK> williams  known more for improbable comeback than collapse  had not lost a grand slam match after holding a match point since the   french open  <BRK> pliskova  the no    seed  will face the fourth seeded naomi osaka in the semifinal on thursday  the other semifinal pit the eighth seeded petra kvitova against the unseeded american danielle collins  <BRK> this wa williams s fourth major tournament since resuming her career in   after the birth of her daughter  alexis olympia ohanian jr   in september    williams withdrew before the fourth round of last year s french open because of an injury and lost in two other grand slam final   to anqelique kerber at wimbledon and to osaka at the united state open in a match remembered primarily for williams s confrontation with the chair umpire  which cost her a game penalty  <BRK> williams  who dispatched the top seeded simona halep in a hard fought  fourth round match  ha not defeated two top   player at the same event since returning from her pregnancy  she ha spoken candidly about her struggle to return to peak physical condition after giving birth  and she arrived here looking fitter than she had since before her pregnancy  <BRK> williams     ha not reached for excuse  even when she ha struggled in way she had not before leaving the tour to become a mother  <BRK>  from day    i expect to go out and  quite frankly  to win   williams said   that hasn t happened  but i do like my attitude  i like that i don t want to go out here and say   i expect to lose because i had a year off  i ve been playing for   month  i m not supposed to win   i don t have that attitude   <BRK> while williams s mind set ha been positive  on wednesday her body betrayed her and the match suddenly pivoted in pliskova s favor  <BRK> her match turned in an instant  with a commanding     lead in the third set  the  th seeded williams held a match point on her serve  at      but after she wa called for a foot fault on her first serve  williams appeared to sustain an injury in the rally that began off her second serve  rolling her left ankle a she tried to change direction to reach a shot from pliskova  <BRK> williams lost the point  and then the next two point  she did not call a medical timeout on the ensuing changeover  but she retied her shoelace  making them tighter  <BRK>  i really hate calling the trainer out  to be honest   she said   and at that point i didn t feel like i needed it or i didn t feel like it would be a big deal  so i just kept going   <BRK> but the tighter shoe did not keep her in the match  pliskova won the next two game  pulling to      suddenly back on serve  williams earned three more match point in the  th game  but pliskova saved them all  <BRK>  i thought   all right  here we go  you re going to win one of these    williams said   that clearly didn t happen  but i wa just trying at that point   <BRK> pliskova held on to make it     with a backhand cross court winner  punctuated with a loud and long scream  <BRK>  then  suddenly  i got a chance too   pliskova said of her improbable victory after facing four match point   that s how it is in tennis  you need luck  of course  because this is   i think   not happening often  maybe once in life  but i went for it   <BRK> williams  who like all right handers land on her left foot when she serf  lost all   remaining point on her serve after the injury  while she said she would not know how bad her ankle injury wa until a day later  she played down the effect of the injury on the outcome of the match  repeatedly giving pliskova credit for playing  light out  tennis a she surged back  <BRK>  i think she just played well on my serve after that point   williams said   i think she just kind of started playing really  really good  i don t think it had anything to do with my ankle  per se  i just think she wa just nailing and hitting shot  obviously i made some mistake  but she played really well after that   <BRK> pliskova said she thought something might have happened to williams  but that she remained focused on her own side of the court  <BRK>  whatever is happening on the other side  i just try to block it   pliskova said   either it s positive or negative  whatever is there  it s just not my business  i m sorry  but that s how it is  i know once i m starting to think about that  it s bad   <BRK> pliskova won the next two game to complete the improbable comeback  winning after williams hit a forehand into the net for an unforced error on her third match point  <BRK> pliskova  a former no     had knocked williams out of a grand slam event before  beating her in straight set in the   united state open semifinal  she had looked on track for a similarly efficient victory when she broke williams for a     lead in the second set  <BRK> but williams roared back  breaking pliskova at love in the next game  beginning a stretch of winning   of   game and taking complete command of the match before her late collapse  <BRK> pliskova  whose appearance in the   united state open final wa her only previous major title match  ha won two of her previous three match against osaka  she most recently beat her          in the final of the wta tournament in tokyo in september  <BRK> osaka     will be seeking a second straight grand slam title  she reached the semifinal with a          victory over the sixth seeded elina svitolina  <BRK> osaka  who had never reached the quarterfinal of a grand slam before her triumph in new york last fall  said she wa keeping this accomplishment in perspective  <BRK>  to be here is something that a lot of people want  and i know that a few month ago i would have given anything to be in the semifinal of a slam   osaka said   but it s this weird feeling of  you want to do the next big thing  and especially now that i won a grand slam  and i feel like i want to win another one  and i m so close and i just want to keep going   <BRK> osaka and kvitova could each claim the no    ranking for the first time if they win the tournament on saturday  after pulling herself from the brink of defeat  pliskova also ha a chance to return to the no    ranking with a victory  even if she had begun to count herself out of the tournament when she wa one point from defeat  <BRK>  my mind wa in the locker room   pliskova said   i wa still here   <BRK> for williams  who ha the trophy a her goal every time she arrives at a grand slam event  her quest to match margaret court s   single grand slam title will resume at the french open in may  <BRK>  i mean  the big picture for me is always winning   williams said   i m not going to sit here and lie about that  it hasn t happened yet  but i feel like it s going to happen  just keep taking it one match at a time  just keep soldiering on  i guess   <BRK> karen crouse contributed reporting  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
