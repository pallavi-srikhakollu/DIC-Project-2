 <BRK>  <BRK> by karen crouse <BRK> melbourne  australia   the beginning of a calendar year normally would seem a strange time to be preoccupied with ending  but when andy murray tearfully announced his impending retirement because of a deteriorating right hip in a pretournament news conference  the australian open underwent a jarring mood swing  from the so called happy slam to a major dominated talk about pain management and the sometimes extraordinary measure required to prolong career  <BRK> the hospice slam  anyone  <BRK> the   year old murray  a three time major winner  missed the tournament last year because of hip surgery that did not alleviate his suffering  on monday  he valiantly battled the pain and his opponent  roberto bautista agut  for more than four hour before losing in five set  <BRK> rafael nadal     who secured a spot in the second round against matthew ebden  described how his crumbling knee and various other injury have forced him to adjust his practice schedule based on his  body feeling  and to adopt a faster  more aggressive serve to try to shorten point  <BRK> the five time major winner maria sharapova     easily dispatched harriet dart  then spoke about how the shoulder pain that ha plagued her for   year forced her to accept the fact that  you re not immortal  you re never going to play this forever   <BRK> then there wa caroline wozniacki  who is still in her twenty but already managing her own health crisis  wozniacki     returned to rod laver arena for her first round match against alison van uytvanck looking outwardly the same a she did when she outlated simona halep on the same stage lat year to win her first grand slam title  <BRK> wozniacki ran down drop shot and prevailed in most of the rally of more than nine shot in a          victory that belied the extra effort now required for her to maintain her competitive edge  lat summer wozniacki learned she had rheumatoid arthritis  a condition linked to immune system dysfunction  a wozniacki explained it  her immune system attack healthy tissue in and around the joint of her hand  knee and foot  causing rahes  inflammation and fatigue  <BRK> the diagnosis forced wozniacki to overhaul her routine to include more massage  le  or at least smarter  tennis  more rest  le sugar  more stretching and le jogging  <BRK>  you listen to the body  you try different thing   she said  adding   there are day i wake up and don t feel great  and when that happens  i m still going to go out there and do my thing  but i m going to taper it down  and i know in my head i don t need to go full out today and it s going to make me feel worse tomorrow  i ve matured a lot  that s never how i used to think   <BRK> it s remarkable to hear so many prominent player give voice to their vulnerability  a murray acknowledged   when you re going to compete  you want to be positive and optimistic about thing because you don t want to be telling your opponent  the guy you re competing against  how bad you re feeling   <BRK> his friday news conference announcing his retirement  he added   wa kind of the first time i kind of came out and let everyone know how bad it s been and tough   <BRK> wozniacki wa the same way  she knew before last year s united state open that the flulike symptom that had plagued her all summer were  in fact  sign of something more serious  but she said nothing about her condition for two month  waiting until the news conference after her final match of the season  in singapore in october  to reveal the diagnosis  <BRK>  i didn t want to give anyone the edge   wozniacki said  <BRK> she rejected the notion that a full disclosure of her health woe would have benefited her moderating external expectation  <BRK>  i think because i m such a competitor  i don t want anything to be an excuse   wozniacki said  adding   i know myself and what i ve done out there  i m either proud of myself for giving it my all  or i can be disappointed because i thought i could do better  but i don t really need the sympathy   <BRK> wozniacki followed her australian open title with two more victory  in a pre wimbledon tuneup at eastbourne in june and a premier mandatory event in beijing in october   both  she said  while exhibiting one or more of the textbook symptom of rheumatoid arthritis  the beijing win wa especially satisfying  wozniacki said   because i didn t know  will i ever be able to play six match in a row  that really gave me the confidence  you know  if i can do this i can do anything   <BRK> after wimbledon  where wozniacki lost in the second round  the rest of her summer passed in a fog of inconclusive doctor visit and inexplicable early round loss  wozniacki withdrew from the tournament in wahington because of pain in her knee  in her next tournament  in montreal  she lost to aryna sabalenka in her first match and awoke the next morning unable to lift her arm to brush her teeth  from there  it wa on to cincinnati  where she retired after the first set of her first match because she couldn t find the energy to soldier on  <BRK> everywhere wozniacki went  she saw doctor  she said  who proclaimed her fit and sent her away with medication for a head cold or influenza  <BRK>  the doctor did blood test  but they weren t addressing the inflammation  which wa the weird thing   said wozniacki  who found it stranger still that after year of wearing opponent down with her fitness  she wa the one tiring first in her match  <BRK> from cincinnati  wozniacki traveled to new york  where she maintains an apartment  and insisted on undergoing a comprehensive battery of test  one of which came back positive for rheumatoid arthritis  wozniacki wa relieved finally to have a diagnosis but refrained from reading up on the disease  she said  because she wanted to focus on the united state open  <BRK> after her second round loss to lesia tsurenko  wozniacki typed  rheumatoid arthritis  into a search engine on her phone during the ride back to her apartment and quickly educated herself on this new and formidable opponent  she made an appointment to see a new york based rheumatologist  who assuaged her fear  <BRK>  she said a lot of people she work with can live a normal life with it   wozniacki said  <BRK> of course  wozniacki s physically challenging  globe trotting existence is nobody s idea of a normal life  <BRK>  i asked her   what about my tennis  what about my career    wozniacki said   and she said   don t worry  we re going to figure it out    <BRK> in monday s match  wozniacki expressed surprise at van uytvanck s tactic of hitting drop shot from behind the baeline  a if to test her speed and stamen  <BRK> but wozniacki figured it out and hit a few back for winner   i m like   wow  i actually got to them  hit it well  i kind of complimented myself on a couple of them   she said with a laugh  not bothering to disguise her delight in showing how much life is left in her wheel  <BRK>  <BRK>
