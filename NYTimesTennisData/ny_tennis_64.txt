 <BRK>  <BRK> by karen crouse <BRK> melbourne  australia    i ve never done this before   anataia pavlyuchenkova said a she climbed on a stationary bike in front of a crowd that didn t feel that much smaller than the one that had watched her                   upset of fifth seeded sloane stephen at the australian open  <BRK> the fourth round match ended six minute before   a m  on monday morning  and pavlyuchenkova wa mentally making a list of all the task that stood between her and a good morning s sleep  the stationary bike  the reporter with their notebook and microphone  the ice bath  the shower  the change of clothes  the drive back to the hotel  <BRK> pavlyuchenkova asked if she could field question from reporter while she pedaled so she could kill two task with one bike ride  she wa so tired  she had struggled to construct her point on the court  and now she wa having trouble organizing her thought in front of reporter  <BRK> that s what a starting time of nearly half past   will do to a player   it s honestly terrible   pavlyuchenkova said  adding   it s not ideal time to play tennis   <BRK> describing the match  she said   i wa like   this match is so intense  why am i like still sometimes feeling like i m going to fall asleep now    <BRK> the late  late  late show  with host pavlyuchenkova and stephen  started sunday and ended monday  nine match in the first eight day of the tournament ended after midnight  but pavlyuchenkova s win over stephen wasn t close to being the latest finish  <BRK> it wa   minute past   a m  on friday when garbi√±e muguruza clinched her second round match against johanna konta  by the time muguruza met with her coach  showered  changed out of her tennis outfit  received a massage  fulfilled her medium obligation and returned to her hotel  it wa one hour before sunrise  <BRK> and muguruza s match wasn t close to being the latest ever finish in australian open history  that feather is in the pillow of lleyton hewitt and marcos baghdatis  whose third round slugfest here in    won hewitt  ended at     in the morning  <BRK> the prime time television hour in muguruza s native spain are from     p m  until   a m   so she know from flawed time system  <BRK> and yet  muguruza     readily acknowledged that playing that late  is not normal   she added   it wa very awkward   <BRK> the post midnight hour would pose no problem if the player had the body clock of the mostly nocturnal koala bear  who can sleep up to   hour  but the human body s inner clock ha a circadian low  a window roughly between   a m  and   a m   when focus  strength  reaction time and physical flexibility ebb  the better to promote sleep  <BRK> the circadian rhythm can be reset changing sleep or eating pattern  but how can player adjust their internal clock for optimal performance when they re playing at   a m  one day and at   p m  another  <BRK>  there is no way to train that   said maria sharapova  who advanced to the third round in a match that ended at     a m    or roughly two hour past her preferred bedtime  <BRK>  if you ask any player that go into this tournament how many time they have trained after midnight  unless you re jet lagged or just crazy  you don t train for that   <BRK> on the same night that muguruza barely beat both konta and daybreak  novak djokovic outlasted jo wilfried tsonga in a match that ended   minute past midnight  djokovic  the men s world no     ha a reputation for leaving few route unexplored to gain a competitive edge  over the year he ha tried hyperbaric chamber  yoga  meditation  biofeedback and restrictive diet  <BRK> so is he crazy enough to have tried practicing after midnight  <BRK>  no  i have not done that i don t think ever   djokovic said  <BRK> he added with a laugh   i m not doing push ups at midnight before i go to sleep  you train a bit later  and the whole routine is pushed back a little bit  but you also want to get a good night s sleep so your biological rhythm keep going in the right way   <BRK> djokovic ha one strategy  grudgingly adopted  that help him sleep longer and sounder during tournament  he leaf his two small child at home  he may be on to something  norah simpson  a clinical assistant professor at stanford who study the role of sleep on athletic performance  recommends that player get good  quality sleep in the day before match so they don t go into a late night match already sleep deprived  <BRK>  it s very challenging to navigate the variable schedule in respect to both your internal clock and the amount of sleep you re able to obtain   simpson said in a telephone interview  <BRK> the potential for late night match is part of tournament with stadium light and no curfew  madison key played mostly night match on her way to the final at the   united state open  and recalled going to bed after   a m  many morning  waking up around noon and taking power nap whenever she could   it s not natural   she said  adding   if i know i m playing a night match  i sleep a much a i can the day before   <BRK> anastasia pavlyuchenkova s coach  simon goffin  encouraged her to stay up until   a m  the night before playing stephen to help reset her body clock  <BRK>  i pushed her to watch a movie  do something  even after midnight  to be used to this kind of late match   said goffin  who also insisted that she sleep in until noon   it s important for the body and the mind to have this routine   <BRK> still  pavlyuchenkova said she felt sluggish   it wa so  so strange because i wa like  come on  i have to make rally    she said   my energy level wa on and off a well  i wa trying to get a many energy drink and gel pack a i could take   <BRK> after ingesting all that caffeine  how did pavlyuchenkova plan to get to sleep   i don t know honestly   she said  adding   try to take chamomile tea   <BRK> ben rothenberg contributed reporting  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
