 <BRK>  <BRK> by karen crouse <BRK> melbourne  australia   a veteran right hander with an all court game and a one handed backhand  the hand down greatest player of his era  wa trying to dodge an upset in a fourth round match of a grand slam tournament against a former junior world no    with long hair  a flowing one handed backhand and no fear  <BRK> in their first official head to head meeting  pete sampras  then    could not hold off a   year old roger federer  who won in five set at wimbledon in    <BRK> on sunday night at the australian open  federer  the two time defending champion  wa the one looking across the net at a younger  fresher  more fearless version of himself  and like sampras   year earlier  federer had no answer for his fourth round opponent  stefanos tsitsipas  a former junior world no    from greece who sent him packing with a                                defeat in their first official head to head meeting  <BRK> federer wa the  th seed in   when he beat sampras  the top seed and a seven time wimbledon champion  tsitsipas     is the  th seed and the youngest player remaining in the men s draw  with the victory  tsitsipas foiled the   year old federer s bid to become the oldest man to reach the quarterfinal here since the   year old ken rosewall in    <BRK>  i lost to a better player who wa playing very well tonight   said the third seeded federer  a   time grand slam champion  including six title in australia   he hung in there  gave himself chance at some point  stayed calm  it s not always easy  especially for younger guy  credit to him for taking care of that   <BRK> the match lasted   hour   minute  but federer essentially cinched his fate two hour in  after he squandered eight break point  including three on unforced error  to give tsitsipas enough of an opening to squeeze past him in the second set  <BRK>  it definitely didn t go the way i wa hoping on the break point   said federer  who kept searching for a weakness to exploit only to see his strength reflected back at him  <BRK> tsitsipas looked eminently comfortable at the net and he matched federer winner for winner on the forehand side  with    <BRK>  he did a nice job of taking care of his half volley   federer said   that s maybe what won him the match tonight  i m not sure   <BRK> perhaps pride kept federer from equivocating  the difference in the match wa tsitsipas s youthful energy  which he oozed with his every tigger like step  federer simply couldn t match it from the first point to the last  a backhand that he netted  <BRK> federer wated no time after the match completing his medium responsibility  leaving the clear impression that he couldn t put this loss in his rearview mirror fat enough  his eye grew glasy a his news conference wore on  a if his feeling about the loss had traveled from his mouth to his marrow  <BRK>  i have massive regret  you know  tonight   said federer  who also announced he intended to play some event on clay this spring after skipping clay court season the past two year   i might not look the part  but i am  i felt like i have to win the second set  i don t care how i do it  but i have to do it   <BRK> tsitsipas  who train at the academy of patrick mouratoglou  whose best known pupil is the   time major winner serena williams  wa proud of the mental toughness he showed in fending off a dozen break point in all  <BRK>  i could have cracked at any moment   he said   but i didn t because i really wanted it bad   <BRK> tsitsipa said he believed from the first point that he could pull off the upset and described the victory a  a beginning of something really big   <BRK> tsitsipas broke onto the scene last year reaching the final of the rogers cup in toronto in august  defeating four top   player  including novak djokovic  on the way  <BRK> tsitsipas is in the quarterfinal of a major for the first time  he will face  d seeded roberto bautista agut     who will also be playing his first grand slam quarterfinal  <BRK> john mcenroe  a seven time grand slam winner  conducted the post match  on court interview with tsitsipa and described his victory a a changing of the guard  <BRK>  i ve heard that story the last   year   federer said   from that standpoint  nothing new   <BRK> he had a point  consider grigor dimitrov  now    who made it to the quarterfinal here in    he lost sunday to france tiafoe and is   for   in major  <BRK> before dimitrov  there wa jo wilfried tsonga  now    who lost to novak djokovic in the   final here and hasn t advanced to another grand slam final  <BRK> even a player like andy murray  whose sterling career included major title and win over federer  fell short of federer s gold standard  <BRK> so  yes  the torch ha been passed  only to get extinguished  but there wa a hint of resignation in federer s voice and a slump in his shoulder during his news conference that belied the breeziness of his rebuttal to mcenroe s observation  <BRK>  about stefanos  i think he s definitely done a really nice job now the last year and a half   federer said  adding   i see him definitely being high up in the game for a long time  this wa a good night for him tonight   <BRK> after sampras lost to federer at wimbledon  he won one more major  the   united state open  then retired  how many more chance will federer get to grow his legacy  <BRK> federer looked irked when he wa aked if he could see a bit of himself in tsitsipa  the son of two tennis coach  who ha described federer a his childhood idol  <BRK>  he ha a one handed backhand and i used to have long hair  too   federer said   yeah  so maybe a little bit  sure   <BRK> want more autralia coverage and discusion  sign up for the weekly autralia letter  start your day
