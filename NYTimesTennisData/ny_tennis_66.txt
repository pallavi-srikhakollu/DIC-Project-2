 <BRK>  <BRK> by ben rothenberg <BRK> melbourne  australia   after losing a close third round match to sloane stephen at the australian open lat week  petra martic kept her emotion in check a she walked off the court of margaret court arena  but once she wa out of sight of the crowd  in the tunnel connecting the arena to the locker room  she could no longer hide her distress  she stepped into a corner  sunk down against a cinder block wall and broke down in heaving sob a she covered her face with a towel  <BRK> but she wa not hidden at all  she wa captured one of the numerous camera positioned throughout the corridor of the australian open  <BRK>  it s just heartbreaking to watch   espn s chris mckendry said on the broadcast after the camera zoomed in for a tighter view of martic s misery  <BRK> the australian open  the most remote grand slam event  is offering voyeurism without the voyage in a way no other tournament doe  player and their entourage are often unaware how many of their movement are monitored and magnified camera that follow them a long and a closely a possible  <BRK> the tournament installed a few fixed camera three year ago and now curate a feed from many remotely operated camera that monitor the recently renovated player  area at melbourne park  the footage appears in segment of television broadcast and can also be seen online in a stand alone stream  <BRK>  we live in big brother society   top ranked novak djokovic said of the camera   i guess you just have to accept it   <BRK> and so the tournament that branded itself the happy slam ha become the orwellian open  <BRK> most of the widely broadcat moment are not a poignant a martic s  look  there s roger federer fist bumping a pasing rafael nadal  over here  gaël monfils is doing an impression of france tiafoe s postmatch celebration   for tiafoe  <BRK> craig tiley  the tournament director  would not say how many camera were used  but he called them  a rich source of content  that would complement match coverage and reveal a more complete picture of the sport and it culture  <BRK> tiley said that the mounted camera were intended to create a single source of video for right holding broadcaster  rather than having the hallway clogged with various camera operator and their equipment  <BRK> tiley said that there were  strict protocol about what could be shown  but that player were not all explicitly warned about the camera or told to sign waiver agreeing to be shown at any time  the high definition camera are in area otherwise off limit to the public and  this year for the first time  to accredited news medium  <BRK>  the camera are round and black and hang down from the ceiling   tiley said   they are very easy to see  and we have had dozen and dozen of player and coach playing up to them   <BRK> there are area the camera do not show  including the player  restaurant and gym  <BRK>  they re not in the locker room  not that i know of   maria sharapova said  smiling   safe there   <BRK> but many player and coach did not realize the scope of the surveillance  serena williams  who starred in her own hbo reality show   being serena   and even gave birth on camera  said she initially did not notice how many camera were tracking her at the tournament until she heard other player talking about them and began to look around  <BRK>  then i wa  like   oh  there is a camera there  oh  there is one there     williams said   they are everywhere  which i actually didn t realize  good to know   <BRK> naomi osaka also underestimated the number of camera watching her  thinking there wa only one   i guess i will be very conscious   she said  <BRK> sure enough  before her next match  she could be seen looking for a many camera a she could spot  laughing a she found one after another  <BRK> simona halep said she had not realized just how ubiquitous the camera were until she saw image of herself that she did not know had been recorded  <BRK>  you guy are filming everything   halep said   i saw everything  i saw when i hugged my mom   <BRK> but she did not consider the camera a bad thing   it s nice   halep said   people can see our reaction  off court moment   <BRK> even martic gained something positive from being caught in a vulnerable moment  she posted on instagram that she had received an outpouring of supportive message from fan who had seen her devastation  <BRK> mostly  the captured scene are mundane  player saying hello a they pas one another in the hall  or entering and exiting the parking lot  or standing around and watching the television monitor  or stretching before match  <BRK> like most reality show  the open video stream ha the tantalizing prospect of romance  the camera seemed to have a particular interest in monfils and elina svitolina  who recently started dating  <BRK> occaionally  a small moment will become viral  such a when federer tried to enter the locker room without his credential and wa stopped a security guard  <BRK>  there is the incredible camaraderie among player and coach and the tennis community   tiley said   it is a community and an environment that we try to capture respectably and appropriately   <BRK> player were caught off guard when the camera first appeared in    at the time  they had microphone that picked up conversation and showed the lounge area of the locker room  <BRK> the camera no longer record sound and are now mostly in area that player pas through rather than where they sit and congregate for long period  <BRK> patrick mouratoglou  who is williams s coach and an analyst for espn and eurosport  said there should be more camera to make new audience invested in the player a people  <BRK>  i think we have to really worry about seducing the young generation with our sport   mouratoglou said   our sport is very  very conservative   which is good because we respect the history of the game  that s great   but also we have to live in our time   <BRK> indeed  the player most engaged in modern medium seems to enjoy the continual camera more than anyone else  stefanos tsitsipas  who spends much of his time off the court filming himself and the world around him for his youtube channel  ha been fascinated the camera he ha spotted around the tournament  <BRK> a he waited to face rafael nadal in the semifinal in melbourne on thursday  tsitsipa paced back and forth and stared at a camera  watching it move with him  <BRK> for superstar like federer  who ha photograph taken of him with and without his permission whenever he is in public  the camera at the australian open were simply an extension of a creeping loss of privacy  <BRK>  it s different time nowadays   federer said   sometime good  sometime bad  it s not like we never have anybody taking picture or video of u  now it s jut like everywhere all the time  it s hard to find the corner where you can actually sort of relax a bit   <BRK> one fish eye view camera at rod laver arena  perched inside the player  box  ha been particularly irksome to coach and supporter  during lucas pouille s quarterfinal match on wednesday  his fiancée  clemence bertrand  tried covering it with a bag of peanut m m  his coach  amélie mauresmo  obscured it with a sweatshirt  <BRK> sascha bajin  osaka s coach  said that he wa self conscious about the camera in his face during match  and that he wa trying to stay away from the one in the corridor  <BRK>  if they re hidden too much   he said   then i feel like they re just kind of trying to catch you on something  you know   <BRK> want more
