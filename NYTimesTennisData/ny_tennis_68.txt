the fifth  his time  he knew  wa almost up  <BRK> murray had battled valiantly to force that final set  coming back after losing the first two to level the match  he even had looked   briefly   a if he might take command of the fifth set a well before bautista agut reeled off five straight game  putting a comeback well out of murray s reach  <BRK> so when the crowd rose to salute him  murray  tear visible in his eye  raised his right arm to acknowledge the applause  seeming to accept the fond farewell and his fate  but he wa not quite done  he saved one match point and held serve  delaying the inevitable one game  buying himself a fragment of time  <BRK> bautista agut  the no    seed  served out his victory one game later  closing out a                                 result after   hour   minute  <BRK> it wa the longest match of the first day of the australian open  and a fine representation of a dogged career that may be ending soon  <BRK> murray  a three time grand slam champion whose ranking ha slipped to  th  ha been slowed a hip injury for more than a year  he said in his pretournament news conference on friday that he had set wimbledon this year a his  end point   and that he could not rule out that this tournament might be his lat  <BRK>  if this wa my last match  an amazing way to end   murray said in an on court interview   i gave literally everything i had   <BRK> murray had made the match more competitive than many expected  while he ha been hobbled  bautista agut won an atp tournament in doha  qatar  eight day ago  though his movement wa visibly encumbered at time  murray maintained many of his other gift  and fought his way through several long rally with his signature drop shot  giving a crowd that included his mother  judy  and brother  jamie  plenty to cheer  <BRK>  today i knew it wa potentially the last match i play  i don t care if i damage my hip anymore in the match   murray said   so it s a bit easier to deal with the pain because i know that i don t have to hit ball tomorrow   <BRK> by the time murray had joined his former coach mark petchey for an on court interview  his raw emotion seemed to have settled  which almost seemed to catch him off guard  <BRK>  actually   he said   i think i m going to be all right   <BRK> despite the finality of his remark on friday  and despite the eulogy for his career that had been shared in the day since   including a tribute video from other top player that played a he stood on the court monday night   murray left the door open to a return  <BRK>  i don t know   maybe i ll see you again   he said  drawing cheer from the crowd   i ll do everything possible to try  if i want to go again  i ll need to have a big operation  which there s no guarantee i ll be able to come back from anyway  but i ll give it my best shot   <BRK> murray wa referring to a hip resurfacing operation like the one that the double player bob bryan underwent lat year  bryan is trying to come back this seaon  in his postmatch news conference  murray said that he would decide soon between struggling through month of further pain without surgery in order to play wimbledon a a lat hurrah  or to have the surgery with an eye on continuing his career after rehabilitation  <BRK> murray said he thought he would make his decision  in the next week or so   <BRK>  if i go ahead with the operation and i don t recover well from it  then i don t play again   i m aware of that   he said   that is the decision that i have to make  it will improve my quality of life  i ll be in le pain doing just normal thing like walking around and putting your shoe and sock on and thing  just now  going to walk my dog  playing football with my friend  is like the worst thing i can think of doing  like  i hate it  because it s so sore and it s uncomfortable   <BRK> those cold reality probably will sink in for murray soon after he leaf melbourne  but he said he would be o k  if monday s loss wa his final match  <BRK>  if today wa my lat match  look  it wa a brilliant way to finish   he said   that s something that i ll probably take into consideration  a well  it wa an amazing atmosphere  i literally gave everything that i had on the court  fought a best a i could  and performed a lot better than what i should have done without the amount i ve been able to practice and train   <BRK> murray is known for his indefatigable work ethic  so settling for the le painful option ha never been his strong suit  <BRK>  it s also been a flaw of mine   he said   some people might say   it s a positive thing that andy worked really  really hard  such and such  trained hard   but i also often didn t stop myself when i wa being told to do thing  i should have sometimes said   no  i m not doing that today   or   no  i don t want to train today  i m sore  i need a day off   i didn t do that  i would always kind of just go along with what i wa being told  that wa a mistake   <BRK>  <BRK>
