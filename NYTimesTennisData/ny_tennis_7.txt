 <BRK>  <BRK> by cindy shmerler <BRK> delray beach  fla    dan evans finished a practice session last month  grabbed a racket the string and marched from the court toward the player locker room  <BRK> it wa the same path walked juan martín del potro the night before  for del potro  a flah mob gathered a fan chanted  olé  olé  olé  delpo  delpo   and implored the popular argentine to autograph photo  tennis ball  hat  t shirt and even one man s bald head  <BRK> when evans walked the route  just hour before he wa to take the court against radu albot in the final of the delray beach open on feb     no one stopped him to chat or ask for his autograph  not a single spectator recognized evans  a   year old briton  <BRK> he wa alone with his thought  but he wa used to that  <BRK> for more than a year  evans spent most of his time alone after being barred from the atp tour for a positive drug test for cocaine  evans said that while he used cocaine recreationally and out of competition  which is not prohibited in tennis  he tested positive during the barcelona open in april   when he left some of the drug in a bag that contaminated other medication  <BRK> evans  who wa ranked a career high no    at the time of his ban  had recently reached his first career atp final in sydney  he did not appeal the charge  <BRK> the delray beach open wa only his fourth atp tour tournament since his return in april    he lost the final to albot in a third set tiebreaker despite holding three match point  but his ranking is up to no    a he begin the qualifying tournament for the bnp pariba open in indian well  calif   on tuesday  <BRK> with no ability to play tournament or train during the ban  evans retreated to his home in cheltenham on the outskirt of the picturesque cotswold  some   mile northwest of london  he wa forbidden to even practice at any facility affiliated with britain s lawn tennis association for   month  <BRK> he filled his day quietly playing golf and watching television  though he refused to tune in to any tennis match  he said he would not even follow tournament result in the newspaper  some day  he said  it wa too painful to leave the house  <BRK>  it wa a really tough time in my life   evans said   but there were a lot of other people around me who had a difficult year a well  i would be selfish to think that it didn t affect everyone else in my life  <BRK>  those feeling of anger and hurt at what you did to people don t go away easily   evans added  referring to the pain and embarrassment he caused his family  his girlfriend and a bevy of coach and supporter  <BRK> this wa not the first time he had been penalized  in    evans wa pulled from the wimbledon junior tournament the l t a   the national governing body the sport  for unacceptable on court behavior  two year later  he wa suspended the l t a  for four month after he wa photographed during wimbledon at a nightclub in the early morning hour  and in    the l t a  stopped financially supporting him for underperformance and a poor attitude  <BRK> evans wa unranked when he returned from this latest suspension in april   and wa forced to start at the lower level of professional tennis  with no point to defend  and little compassion from his fellow competitor  evans began entering challenger  tennis s version of the minor league  he often had to play three match just to get into the tournament s main draw  but in august he won a challenger in vancouver  british columbia  and reached the final of another in france in february  <BRK> at the atp tour level  he wa given a wild card to play the event at queen s club in london in june and lost his first match  he tried to qualify for wimbledon last year  reaching the second round  he qualified for the main draw of this year s australian open and lost to roger federer in the second round  his breakthrough at delray beach included win over no    john isner and no    france tiafoe  <BRK>  in retrospect  his journey ha been incredibly quick for someone with no ranking   said david felgate  tim henman s longtime coach  who began working with evans just after his return   dan doen t expect anything from anyone  he doen t expect sympathy  he know what he did to himself  but it doe give him a different perspective and may prolong his career  when you realized you missed a year  you want to make up for it  you want this career to go on for a long time because you know what not playing felt like   <BRK> at   foot    evans lack the serving power of tennis s taller player like del potro  who is      but evans is scrappy off the ground  particularly with his running forehand pa down the line  he also posse an effective one handed slice backhand  and he love to volley  just a his countryman henman did  <BRK> a far a he ha come over the lat year  he know he ha still got a long way to go  <BRK>  listen  that episode in my life of being banned  it s over   evans said   everyone forgave me a soon a i held my hand up and accepted the blame  but it s not eay to be happy with yourself day in and day out when the fact is  i wa no    in the world and i threw it all away   <BRK> he added   but to say that i ve grown  that would be justifying it  there s no sort of philosophical looking back on it  it wa the worst thing ever  now  i m just back trying to win tennis match   <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
