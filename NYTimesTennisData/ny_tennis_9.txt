 <BRK>  <BRK> by karen crouse <BRK> melbourne  australia   in a riveting australian open woman s final on saturday  petra kvitova tried unsuccessfully to shake naomi osaka  kvitova earned five break point in the first set  which she could not convert  and saved three championship point in the second  which she ultimately wa unable to capitalize on  <BRK> osaka refused to fade away  later  a the rod laver arena crowd celebrated osaka s                   victory  kvitova looked around to congratulate her opponent   and couldn t find her anywhere  <BRK>  well done  naomi   kvitova said  craning her neck to look behind her   where are you   <BRK> every little thing osaka doe on the court inexorably draw the eye to her  but take the racket out of her hand and she visibly shrink from the spotlight  born in japan and raised in the united state a japanese mother and a haitian father  she wa asked in an interview on australian television if she wa ready to become the face of the   olympics in tokyo  <BRK>  yikes   she said  wincing   hopefully for their sake they don t do that   <BRK> how can they not  <BRK> osaka came into this tournament lat year ranked no     when the new world ranking come out on monday  osaka     the reigning united state open champion  will become the first single player  male or female  from japan to reach no     the retired chinese star li na might a well have been pasing a torch when she presented osaka with the daphne akhurst memorial cup in the on court trophy presentation  <BRK> li  a two time major winner  rose to no     behind serena williams  shortly after winning the   australian open  for five year  no single player from asia had climbed higher  <BRK> osaka  the first woman since jennifer capriati in   to win her first two major title back to back  doe not appear to be going anywhere but forward  <BRK> when osaka defeated williams in the u s  open final in september  she wa the eighth different woman since the   australian open to win a grand slam title  by consolidating her victory in new york with her performance in melbourne  osaka demonstrated that she ha staying power  <BRK> osaka s victory over williams  in retrospect  seems to have represented a coronation of sort  one queen ceding the throne to her successor  that idea got lost in that final s chaotic finish  when the chair umpire  carlos ramos  warned williams about a coaching infraction  setting off a chain of event that thrust williams into the spotlight and osaka into the shadow  <BRK>  definitely she is a great one   kvitova  a two time wimbledon champion  said of osaka   we ll see what the future will bring  but for sure she ha probably everything that ha to be there to play her best tennis   <BRK> kvitova     wa the same age that osaka is now in   when she won her first wimbledon title  it took her three year to return to a grand slam final  and she took the title again at wimbledon in    <BRK>  i probably wasn t really ready to win it  to be honest   said kvitova  who spoke of struggling to adjust to increased expectation   and not just from the public  <BRK>  you re thinking like you have to win every single match because you just won a grand slam   she said  adding   i put a bit more pressure than i should   <BRK> osaka also expects a lot of herself  it is what drove her in the past year to create more spin on her forehand  which produced eight winner in the deciding set on saturday  she ha also worked on the placement  and not just the pace  of her serve  also to great effect  she recorded nine ace in the final to finish the tournament with    which wa   more than the next highest woman  <BRK> and against kvitova  osaka wa able to corral her emotion after the second set got away from her  which hasn t always been her strong suit  she lost in the semifinal of a tuneup event in brisbane after she worked herself into a fury because she felt it wa a match that no major champion should lose  <BRK> rain wa in the air in melbourne park   a few drop fell late in the third set  prompting the roof to be closed for the end of the match  but osaka can create her own weather system  and the storm cloud were gathering between her ear in the second set a kvitova became more aggressive with her groundstrokes and pushed osaka deeper behind the baeline  <BRK> the power game will be on display in this year s woman s u  s  open final when two of the hardest hitter in the game  serena williams and naomi osaka  square off  it will be the first grand slam final for osaka who ha burst onto the scene with one of the most powerful forehand in woman s tennis  <BRK> a the second set wore on  osaka rubbed her temple  glowered at her racket and  at one point  turned her back on kvitova and took deep breath  trying to gather herself  after losing the lat four game  osaka took a bathroom break to regroup before the deciding set  and left the court in tear  <BRK> while she wa gone  osaka said  she reminded herself that kvitova wa an excellent player  she told herself she had to expect a hard fought battle  especially after the long and winding path kvitova had traveled to get to the final  her first since she sustained a career threatening injury while fighting off a knife wielding burglar in her czech republic apartment in late    <BRK>  i can t really act entitled   osaka said   to be playing against one of the best player in the world  to lose a set  suddenly think that i m so much better than her  that isn t a possibility   <BRK> osaka s pep talk to herself wa effective  in the third game of the third set  she broke kvitova   i literally just tried to turn off my feeling   osaka said  <BRK> she ha won   consecutive match in which she ha taken the first set  but don t ask her to explain how she doe it  talking is not one of her talent  osaka said   like in my day to day i might speak like   sentence   she said  <BRK> osaka grimaced through the trophy presentation  which she wa able to laugh about afterward   i forgot to smile   she said   i wa told to smile and i didn t  i wa panicking   <BRK> osaka forgot a lot of the reminder she had written down on a sheet of paper   just in case she won and had to deliver a speech  osaka is shy but thoughtful  reserved but disarmingly revealing  <BRK> describing the third set  she said   i just felt kind of hollow  like i wa a robot  sort of  i wa just executing my order  like i just did what i ve been practicing my whole life   <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
