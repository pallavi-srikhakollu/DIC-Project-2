had pass oscar robertson  too <BRK> it s kind of a gift and a curs that you re not realli abl to enjoy the moment   or that i chose not to  rather   clemon said   i do understand the signific of the event  <BRK>histori is be made in colleg basketbal this season  but not all of it is be made for team that are like bound for the final four or player who are project to be select earli in the next n b a  draft <BRK>with     career point at campbel  clemon is two behind hersey hawkin  the former bradley player  for eighth all time  head into thursday s game with high point  at south dakota state  anoth senior  mike daum  is pois to break into the top   season s end  with     point  he could pass man in the jackrabbit  game on thursday against fort wayn <BRK>it is an unignor fact that most of the player still ahead of clemon and daum on the career score list are not household name  either  after hawkin  for instanc  clemon could pass keydren clark  who play for st  peter s  in jersey citi  harri kelli of texa southern  in houston  and perhap even alphonso ford of mississippi valley state  who hold fourth place with     point   first place  a countri mile  with     point  is the louisiana state legend pete maravich  even though he play onli three season  <BRK> i recogn that a lot of peopl on that list  who score a lot of point in colleg  didn t go on to have success n b a  career   said hawkin  who did have a success n b a  career and now work for the portland trail blazer <BRK>freeman william   who is second  and the scorer of     point for portland state   acknowledg that his colleg year had been his glori day   i got most of my attent as a basketbal player back then   he said <BRK>clemon and daum fit in the same categori  daum is a two time  and probabl three time  summit leagu player of the year  clemon is lead all divis i player in score this season  averag near   point a game  although both are like to get opportun to shine dure the n b a  s summer leagu or on it develop leagu roster  said fran fraschilla  the former coach and espn draft analyst  the   foot   inch daum is at best a late second round draft pick  clemon  who is list at      is unlike to be draft at all <BRK>the relat anonym of colleg basketbal s lead career scorer appear to be a featur  not a bug  if you are score so mani point for so much time  you most like are not do so at colleg basketbal s height <BRK> if mike daum or chris clemon had gone to play in the big ten or the a c c    fraschilla said last week  refer to the atlant coast confer   they wouldn t be on the verg of score     point  <BRK>he ad   as good player as they are  they would be on team with other realli talent player  as oppos to go to a school like s d s u  or campbel  where virtual from day   their talent was such that they were the domin player not onli on their team but in their leagu  <BRK>and had they domin as they have in a bigger leagu  they probabl wouldn t be senior  the best colleg basketbal player are around for onli one or two season <BRK> let s not kid ourselv   said lionel simmon  who is third with     career point for la sall   some of these player  if they didn t come out earli  they could have score      <BRK>but even when top talent play for three or four colleg season  they did so for top team whose other talent player lower the individu demand on them  superl colleg player like u c l a  s lew alcindor  who later chang his name to kareem abdul jabbar  and georgetown s patrick ewe had the kind of support cast that come with championship team <BRK>the most promin name in the top    after robertson  is larri bird  who play most of his colleg career at indiana state  a team that he led to the final four  but one that need him to averag   point a game  but a place on the list can still be a point of pride year later <BRK>hawkin acknowledg that he kept tab on develop in the career score top    in    a blazer scout was at the creighton game in which
