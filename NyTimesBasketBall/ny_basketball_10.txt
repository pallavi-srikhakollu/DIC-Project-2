 <BRK>  <BRK> by marc tracy <BRK> buy creek  n c    with three second left in the first half lat wednesday night  campbell point guard chris clemons wa fouled on a layup  he banged the floor in frustration a the ball rimmed out  then rose and hit both free throw  someone in the sparsely populated stand yelled   congratulation  chris   given the size of the crowd  it s almost certain clemons heard him  <BRK> the second free throw wa clemons s  nd point of the night  and the    nd of his four season career at campbell  a private university about an hour s drive south of raleigh  n c   his hometown  it also meant clemons  a senior  had entered the top   of the men s division i college basketball career scoring list  passing the former kansa star danny manning  by the end of the game  when clemons had finished off a season high   point effort  he had passed oscar robertson  too  <BRK>  it s kind of a gift and a curse that you re not really able to enjoy the moment   or that i chose not to  rather   clemons said   i do understand the significance of the event   <BRK> history is being made in college basketball this season  but not all of it is being made for team that are likely bound for the final four or player who are projected to be selected early in the next n b a  draft  <BRK> with     career point at campbell  clemons is two behind hersey hawkins  the former bradley player  for eighth all time  heading into thursday s game with high point  at south dakota state  another senior  mike daum  is poised to break into the top   season s end  with     point  he could pas manning in the jackrabbit  game on thursday against fort wayne  <BRK> it is an unignorable fact that most of the player still ahead of clemons and daum on the career scoring list are not household name  either  after hawkins  for instance  clemons could pas keydren clark  who played for st  peter s  in jersey city  harry kelly of texas southern  in houston  and perhaps even alphonso ford of mississippi valley state  who hold fourth place with     point   first place  a country mile  with     point  is the louisiana state legend pete maravich  even though he played only three season   <BRK>  i recognize that a lot of people on that list  who scored a lot of point in college  didn t go on to have successful n b a  career   said hawkins  who did have a successful n b a  career and now work for the portland trail blazer  <BRK> freeman williams   who is second  and the scorer of     point for portland state   acknowledged that his college year had been his glory day   i got most of my attention a a baketball player back then   he said  <BRK> clemons and daum fit in the same category  daum is a two time  and probable three time  summit league player of the year  clemons is leading all division i player in scoring this season  averaging nearly   point a game  although both are likely to get opportunity to shine during the n b a  s summer league or on it development league roster  said fran fraschilla  the former coach and espn draft analyst  the   foot   inch daum is at best a late second round draft pick  clemons  who is listed at      is unlikely to be drafted at all  <BRK> the relative anonymity of college basketball s leading career scorer appears to be a feature  not a bug  if you are scoring so many point for so much time  you most likely are not doing so at college basketball s height  <BRK>  if mike daum or chris clemons had gone to play in the big ten or the a c c    fraschilla said last week  referring to the atlantic coast conference   they wouldn t be on the verge of scoring     point   <BRK> he added   a good player a they are  they would be on team with other really talented player  a opposed to going to a school like s d s u  or campbell  where virtually from day   their talent wa such that they were the dominant player not only on their team but in their league   <BRK> and had they dominated a they have in a bigger league  they probably wouldn t be senior  the best college baketball player are around for only one or two seaons  <BRK>  let s not kid ourselves   said lionel simmons  who is third with     career point for la salle   some of these player  if they didn t come out early  they could have scored       <BRK> but even when top talent played for three or four college season  they did so for top team whose other talented player lowered the individual demand on them  superlative college player like u c l a  s lew alcindor  who later changed his name to kareem abdul jabbar  and georgetown s patrick ewing had the kind of supporting cast that come with championship team  <BRK> the most prominent name in the top    after robertson  is larry bird  who played most of his college career at indiana state  a team that he led to the final four  but one that needed him to average   point a game  but a place on the list can still be a point of pride year later  <BRK> hawkins acknowledged that he kept tab on development in the career scoring top    in    a blazer scout wa at the creighton game in which doug mcdermott  now of the indiana pacer  passed hawkins   he wa texting me   six point away    two point away    hawkins said   he thought it wa funny  i wa sitting at dinner getting texted every three minute   <BRK> last week  clemons deflected postgame question about passing manning and robertson  saying he wa focused on this season  in which the fighting camel       are third in the big south  asked whether he had kept the game ball  he laughed  of course he had not  <BRK>  after it s all said and done  i ll definitely go back and look  reminisce on the year i ve had here  kind of be amazed at myself  know what i wa able to accomplish   clemons said  <BRK> like clemons  daum emphaized in a telephone interview that he ha been putting his team first  still  he said  he could not help noticing recently when he pased bird  a well a duke s j  j  redick and north carolina s tyler hansbrough  two star from the lat decade whom daum had grown up watching  <BRK>  i feel like i m going to look back on it    his eventual scoring total    maybe when i m older  and be like   see how cool it wa to be in that position    daum said  <BRK>  for me personally   he added   it s just getting ready for the next thing   <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
