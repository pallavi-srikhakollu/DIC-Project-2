 <BRK>  <BRK> by david waldstein <BRK> columbia  s c    jack white arrived at duke in the summer of    a hard working  eager kid from traralgon  australia  thinking he wa ready for big time college basketball  he had no idea exactly what he wa about to face  <BRK> in a summer pickup game  white found himself guarding another incoming freshman  jayson tatum  a recruit from st  louis who wound up a the no    pick in the n b a  draft le than a year later  tatum took white into the low post  but white fought for his defensive position and cut off tatum s access to the rim  <BRK> so tatum jumped away from the basket  spun in midair and swished a turnaround jumper over white s outstretched arm  <BRK>  you would never see that shot taken in australia   white said  <BRK> in his three season at duke  white ha seen quite a few thing he never would have in australia  forget guarding some of the top player in the atlantic coast conference   in his first two year  white went chest to chest with no fewer than four n b a  lottery pick in duke practice alone  this season  zion williamson  r j  barrett and cam reddish joined that group  those three are expected to be selected high in the first round of this summer s n b a  draft  making it seven lottery pick who have put white through his pace   and the ringer   at one point or another  <BRK>  when you guard those guy every day   jon scheyer  duke s associate head coach  said   you not only get better  you get more confident  down the stretch in big game  he s really locked people up  defense ha been a huge part of what he s done for u   <BRK> white ha averaged     point and     rebound in     minute a game this season  nearly all of it off the bench  he strained his hamstring in the a c c  tournament and did not play in duke s narrow second round win over central florida   a game in which his defense wa missed and central florida came within a buzzer beating tip in of ending top ranked duke s season  <BRK> white ha had a cortisone shot  and expects to play when duke       face fourth seeded virginia tech       on friday  <BRK> at   foot   and   pound  white like to use his physical strength to impose his will  he ha tangled with the massive williamson in practice throughout the year and said the experience toughened him  williamson seems to share that opinion  asked to identify the one teammate he would want to have his back in a skirmish  he immediately replied   jack   <BRK> most expert predict williamson will be the no    pick in the n b a  draft  but barrett could go second or third  and reddish play like a first round pick  a well  <BRK>  going back and forth between zion  r j  and cam  three just supertalented offensive player  you ve got to be locked in so you don t get embarrassed every day   white said  adding   you ve got to learn how to use what you have to best combat what they do   <BRK> white said that like his most renowned teammate  he hope to play in the n b a   but he know he ha work to do on his offensive game to make it happen   he endured an   for   streak on   pointer this season   he also hope to play for australia in the   olympics  <BRK> his duke career came a something of a surprise  in his final year of high school in victoria state  in southeatern australia  he wa weighing whether to play at boise state or professionally in australia when duke came calling  eager for a challenge  he accepted the offer  even though he knew playing time would be hard to come on a team stacked with blue chip recruit  <BRK> he impressed scheyer and the rest of the duke coaching staff in his first scrimmage when he took on some of the best duke had to offer  including tatum  and never backed down  the coach loved his competitive drive and even his trash talking  <BRK>  we were like   oh  we ve got something here    scheyer said  <BRK> white did not play much in his first two year  with tatum and gary trent jr  taking up most of the time at his position  but his role expanded this season  team across the a c c  were acutely aware of when he wa on the floor despite his more heralded teammate  <BRK>  he s long and strong a hell   virginia guard kyle guy said   he s a tough matchup for anybody   <BRK> still  white s toughest assignment continue to come in practice  where previous challenge have come in a variety of size  including marvin bagley iii  a     big man who wa the second overall pick in last year s draft  center wendell carter  who went at no     grayson allen  and luke kennard  <BRK> perhaps surprisingly  white labeled tatum the toughest of all because tatum  he said  had perfected so many deft move  but in williamson  white is encountering a stunning combination of size and athleticism  the first time they squared off over the summer  white thought he had williamson locked down  just a he did with tatum that day in    <BRK> then williamson rose up  and up   and kept elevating right over white  and scored  <BRK>  i wa like   oh  here we go    white said   guy here have that pro game  i had to accept that and realize that this style of play is different from what i wa used to back home  it s tough  but it force you to get better   <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
