 <BRK>  <BRK> by the associated press <BRK> take a look at the five highest scoring season in nba history  <BRK>   wilt chamberlain scored     point in      <BRK>   chamberlain scored     in      <BRK>   michael jordan scored     point in      <BRK>   chamberlain scored     in      <BRK>   chamberlain scored     point in      <BRK> there they are  the five best season in term of point that the nba ha ever seen  and those five season all have something in common   when they were over  someone not named chamberlain or jordan wa the mvp  <BRK> what james harden did this season for the houston rocket wa scintillating  he scored   or more point nine time  he scored   twice  he scored at least   point in   consecutive game  a stretch that lasted more than two month  he will finish this season with the seventh highest scoring average in nba history and win the scoring title more than   point per game   a ridiculous margin  <BRK> he win most voluminous point  <BRK> but maybe not the most valuable player  <BRK> there are some tremendous individual race in the nba this season  with a slew of deserving candidate for coach of the year  a rather unexpected two person race for rookie of the year  and the annual befuddlement about who should win defensive player of the year  the ballot that voter will agonize over most  in some case  will be the one for mvp  <BRK> is it harden  for the second straight year  <BRK> or is it milwaukee s giannis antetokounmpo  <BRK> compelling case can be made either way  harden carried the rocket and became the most unguardable player in the league  antetokounmpo took a team that finished seventh in the east last year and lifted it to the no    overall seed in the nba  continuing his meteoric rise toward total superstardom  <BRK> harden is the better scorer  antetokounmpo the more accurate shooter  harden is the better ballhandler and passer  antetokounmpo the better rebounder and defender  take antetokounmpo off the buck  and they d be lucky to make the playoff  take harden off the rocket  and they d be lucky to make the playoff  <BRK> the biggest argument for harden is the scoring  it ha been sensational  without question  <BRK> but there is precedent  a chamberlain and jordan learned  even a gazillion point doesn t guarantee anyone the maurice podoloff trophy  <BRK> when these playoff are over and the trophy is finally handed out in late june  harden will find out if scoring wa enough to win the vote this time  <BRK> it is tradition in this space to end the regular season having ap basketball writer brian mahoney and tim reynolds reveal their choice for certain award and predict what will happen in the playoff  <BRK> their selection  <BRK> mvp <BRK> mahoney  antetokounmpo  tough to demote harden when he wa even more valuable this season than last  but can t ignore a guy with the greek freak s stats on the surprise winningest team in the league  <BRK> reynolds  antetokounmpo  he get the nod over harden because the buck enjoyed a level of success that few expected  and he s why  <BRK> most improved player <BRK> mahoney  d angelo russell  brooklyn  didn t just have a great season  he saved one for a net team that wa going nowhere  <BRK> reynolds  pascal siakam  toronto  the raptor were     when he had a double double  and he more than doubled his scoring average  <BRK> coach of the year <BRK> mahoney  mike budenholzer  milwaukee  oversaw improvement across the board to turn a team with playoff aspiration into one with championship aspiration  <BRK> reynolds  doc river  la clipper  hard call over budenholzer  steve kerr  nick nurse  steve clifford  michael malone and kenny atkinson also deserving  <BRK> rookie of the year <BRK> mahoney  luka doncic  dallas  not many player become must see tv before they even turn    <BRK> reynolds  luka doncic  dallas  trae young came on like gangbusters at the end of the year  but doncic wa better from start to finish  <BRK> eastern conference champion <BRK> mahoney  milwaukee  the buck do so many thing well that they can find a way even when thing get tougher  <BRK> reynolds  toronto  milwaukee is built for the long haul and might not be ready   yet  but for the raptor  if not now  then when  <BRK> western conference champion <BRK> mahoney  golden state  still far the best combination of talent and experience in the league  <BRK> reynolds  golden state  if healthy  the warrior are still the one to beat  and they want to send oracle arena out the right way  <BRK> nba champion <BRK> mahoney  warrior in    <BRK> reynolds  warrior in    <BRK> bold offseason prediction <BRK> mahoney  the july   firework boom brightest in new york  where kevin durant is the centerpiece of a transformed knicks team  <BRK> reynolds  if the warrior win this title  and they should  expect the core to all come back and try to four peat  yes  including durant  <BRK> ___ <BRK> brian mahoney is the ap basketball writer based
