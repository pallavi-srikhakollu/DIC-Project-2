 <BRK>  <BRK> virginia    oregon   <BRK> by joe depaolo <BRK> louisville  ky    while the fan at the kfc yum  center here in louisville caught their breath thursday night after a classic duel between purdue and tennessee in the first game of the south region doubleheader  no    seed virginia and no    oregon slogged through a tight  mediocre first half  <BRK> the cavalier took a     lead into halftime  and appeared on their way to a comfortable   if not picturesque   victory  <BRK> but oregon clawed it way back in the second half and took the lead       on a   pointer louis king with   minute   second remaining  <BRK> suddenly  the cavalier   who made the wrong kind of history last year becoming the first no    seed in the n c a a  men s basketball tournament ever to fall to a no     the university of maryland  baltimore county    were once again being pushed hard an opponent seeded in the double digit  <BRK> but this time  they did not succumb  after several tight possession on both end of the floor  virginia guard ty jerome made a   pointer to give the cavalier a     lead with     to play   an advantage they would not relinquish  virginia went on to prevail       <BRK>  it wa a knuckle buster or whatever you want to call it   virginia coach tony bennett said   we had to fight   <BRK> for bennett  a knuckle buster is  of course  highly preferable to a bracket buster  a top seeded virginia again going down in an early tournament upset would have shattered bracket across the country  <BRK> but this is a team that life on the edge  and so  despite the fact that the game wa mired in the  s through much of the second half  the cavalier did not panic  <BRK>  the game is never out of reach until the final buzzer go off   jerome said  with a nod to the duck   they re such a capable team  such a great defensive team   <BRK> virginia is well versed in that style  the cavalier entered the night averaging     point per game   just inside the top   in the n c a a  but they also led the nation in defense  yielding just   point per game       better than michigan  which sat at no    on the list  <BRK>  you hang on and hang your hat on that defense   bennett said   and hopefully you get enough offense   <BRK> the cavalier got enough on thursday  they question is whether they will do the same on saturday in the regional final against no    seed purdue  which scored   point in it thrilling overtime victory against tennessee  and whether  even if virginia advance to the final four  the critique of it slow paced  defense first style will abate  <BRK>  ugly is in the eye of the beholder   bennett said after thursday s tight win   maybe it wan t great  but i thought it wa pretty good looking for u defensively   <BRK> for purdue  the round of   ha been a dead end the past two season  in    the boilermakers were blown out in the regional semifinal kansa  a year later  texas tech dashed purdue s hope in the very same round  <BRK> but on thursday night in louisville   in an absolute thriller before a spirited crowd   that elusive victory proved sweet for the boilermakers  <BRK> purdue  which frittered away an   point lead over the course of a remarkable second half  managed to survive in grueling  agonizing  but ultimately exhilarating fashion   defeating second seeded tennessee       in overtime  <BRK> this wa a tale of two game wrapped into one  the first featured careless shot  missed free throw and sloppy play  the second  conversely  showcased the game at it finest   with both club making everything in sight  showing the determination and grit which allowed them to reach this point in the n c a a  tournament  <BRK>  our guy hung in there   purdue coach matt painter said  <BRK> he wa particularly proud of a few key defensive stop  saying   i know it wa a high scoring game  but it wa tough to get them   <BRK> the boilermakers took command early  with the game tied       purdue took command of a choppy first half behind a     run  carsen edward  who had been silenced for the first   minute of the contest  caught fire   reeling off   point in a span of   minute   second  starting a run that culminated in a game high   point  <BRK> the volunteer failed to find any sort of rhythm offensively in the first half  a missed dunk admiral schofield midway through the first half served a a fitting symbol of tennessee s offensive futility over the first   minute  a the volunteer went into the locker room at halftime down      <BRK> it appeared to be the same story early on in the second half  purdue extended it margin to   within the first   minute  the throng of orange clad fan in the crowd   having made the relatively short drive from knoxville   appeared utterly despondent  <BRK> but then their volunteer came storming back  an     run cut the margin to    before an edward   pointer coming out of a timeout momentarily stemmed the tide  tennessee  though  kept up the momentum  schofield  who had just   point in tennessee s woeful first half  finished the night with    <BRK> lamont√© turner buried a   pointer to tie the game at      and from there  the two determined squad put on a show  suddenly  the offensive ineptitude that peppered the first half had been replaced brilliance  <BRK> purdue s ryan cline went   of   on the night  and   of   from   point range  en route to   point  none  though  were bigger than his turnaround   pointer to tie the game at     with   second to play  <BRK> tennessee  though  took the lead on the next possession  a grant williams dunk off a miss turner put the volunteer up       <BRK> down    edward drove to the baket and wa blocked williams with     second to play  the ball went out of bound  and there wa some question a to whether it went off edward s foot   resulting in a turnover which would have effectively ended the game  but the official gave purdue the ball  <BRK> williams  for his part  wa unsure who last touched the ball  <BRK>  i couldn t tell you   williams said   when i blocked the shot  i didn t know if it went off me or his leg or anything   <BRK> edward proceeded to get the ball again  he launched a   pointer from the right wing  and wa fouled  <BRK> the foul wa a huge call in purdue s favor  but tennessee s coach rick barnes acknowledged that the official got it right  <BRK>  we know the rule   he said   you ve got to allow the shooter to come back down  it s a tough one  because in that situation  we know we can t foul there and they ve got to make that shot   <BRK> and so edward  his team s leading scorer  stepped to the line with a chance to put his club ahead with     second to play  an     percent foul shooter  edward missed the first   to the roar of the tennessee faithful  but edward turned aside the earsplitting noise and calmly sank the second and third free throw to square the contest at      tennessee failed to get off a shot on the ensuing possession  and the game went to overtime  <BRK> the extra period belonged to the boilermakers  it wa a session in which they never trailed  with le than two minute to play  the no    seed put the game away  a grady eifert delivered a perfect pas to matt haarms   who had a step on his defender and wa cutting toward the baket   to put the boilermakers up    they made enough free throw the rest of the way to put the game on ice  giving purdue a victory that wa three year in the making  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
