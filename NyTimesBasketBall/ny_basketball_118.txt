credential of those assistant to explain why he hired them  pearl     will concede that it is fair to question his judgment <BRK> it s not a cheap shot   he said on wednesday  after a news conference the day before his fifth seeded tiger got past new mexico state       in the opening round of the n c a a  tournament <BRK>but pearl wa peeved that the first question at that news conference  from a wire service reporter  wa whether he wondered during his three year absence from coaching whether he would ever be back <BRK> i ve spent three year out of the game   he said later in an interview   that s what we want to focus on  that s where you guy get in trouble  when you guy start focusing on   if you think those two assistant coach define me  then you don t know me  you can take that angle because it s out there  but i don t think that s accurate  <BRK>second chance do not always come around  especially in college basketball  which is known for it ruthless single elimination tournament

personnel judgment aside  there are at least two thing that appear indisputable about pearl <BRK>first  a a caual viewer might have observed from his work on tv  he is a character  how many other

he wa the coach at tennessee  or regularly left his player laughing   at him more often than with him   when he tried to fire them up <BRK> the best speech he gave u wa before kentucky   guard bryce
