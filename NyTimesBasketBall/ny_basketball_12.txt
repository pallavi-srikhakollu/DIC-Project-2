<BRK><BRK>on college basketball<BRK>by john branch<BRK>jack bowen is an author of a book on sport and ethic  and teach high school course on ethic and philosophy  when it came time to fill out a bracket for the n c a a  men s basketball tournament for a pool at work this year  he did not feel right about it <BRK>given the scandal that plague college basketball  including several team and coach that have advanced to this week s round of   game  not filling out a bracket wa one ethicist s form of quiet protest <BRK> i chose not to do the men s bracket  but i am doing the woman s bracket   bowen said  and he laughed at the questionable line he drew   now  what have i done here  <BRK>what are any of u doing here <BRK>every march  million of american fill out bracket  more than   million people  one count   cheer the underdog and tune in on television  others buy ticket to the game  wear jersey of their favorite team and let win and loss dictate their mood <BRK>yet fan who follow college basketball closely know about the game s intractable relationship to corruption  even many who come just for march madness must know that the real madness is not always on the court <BRK>a wide ranging and fear inducing f b i  investigation into college basketball recruiting continues to ensnare big name college and little known crook  it is why louisiana state  for example  is playing without it head coach  will wade  and why auburn recently had an assistant coach suspended and a former assistant plead guilty of conspiracy for accepting bribe <BRK>this week  the lawyer michael avenatti wa charged with trying to extort up to    million from nike in exchange for concealing information he had about illicit payment to recruit  he ha since revealed some allegation on twitter  among them  oregon s injured center bol bol wa paid to join the duck  he said  oregon  one of the   team still in the tournament  denied the allegation <BRK> we go through period of cleansing  where we all start to think something s not quite right   jim haney  the executive director of the national association of basketball coach  said   college basketball is now going through one of those period  in the best interest of the game  sometimes you have to go through these because you re not able to do it on your own  <BRK>for fan  a much a ever  this n c a a  tournament serf a a tate test for our unholy appetite <BRK>it is called  moral dissonance   bowen said   where someone think   gosh  this is unethical  but i love it so much  and my friend and i have such a good time rooting and cheering that i m going to participate anyway   <BRK>steven mintz  a professor emeritus at california polytechnic state university in san luis obispo who writes a blog called ethic sage  called it  ethical blindness  <BRK> some people say   we can live with this  simply for the love of the game    mintz said <BRK>such internal debate permeate our culture  is it o k  to dance to a michael jackson song  to laugh to a louis c k  joke  to watch a movie produced harvey weinstein  to cheer for football knowing what it may be doing to player  brain <BRK>in this case  is it o k  to fill out bracket  root for winner and perhaps invest financially in program that run afoul of rule  knowing what we know while  perhaps reasonably  suspecting worse <BRK> we do have these quandary that we face  and it s important for u to think about them   said shawn klein  who teach philosophy and sport ethic at arizona state   even if our concluions about how we should act don t necessarily change how we do act  it s important that we re aware of the balance we have here  <BRK>the topic in college basketball is an old one  freshened the latest news  louisiana state ha the familiar ingredient of a championship contender  a premier point guard  a bevy of tall underclassman looking to leave for the n b a  and a hint of scandal <BRK>seeded third in the east region  and led the interim coach tony benford  louisiana state squeezed past  th seeded yale in the first round  then slipped past sixth seeded maryland in the second  next it face second seeded michigan state  a victory might get louisiana state a sunday date with no    duke for a spot in the final four <BRK>louisiana state s seaon began in tragedy  with the shooting death of one of it player  wayde sims  on the eve of preseaon practice  now it climax in the most n c a a  way possible  with each victory treated a either a feel good story of redemption or a cautious tale of corruption <BRK> whatever ha happened to sour this l s u  season  it is all forgotten for now   the baton rouge advocate columnist scott rabalais wrote over the weekend <BRK>it might be a mantra for most team through the annual tournament <BRK>a sport illustrated pointed out lat week  the team with the most final four appearance in history are north carolina  u c l a   kentucky  duke and kansa  but next on the list  if it were a university  would be vacated   the euphemism given to appearance later wiped from the record scandal <BRK>it is easy to imagine vacated making a future run in this year s tournament <BRK>a yearslong f b i  investigation burst into public view in late    exposing the type of black market underbelly long presumed in college sport  especially men s basketball  at it heart were top tier men s basketball program  shoe manufacturer and prized recruit  along with the sticky web of middleman that laced so many of them together  ten men were arrested  including assistant coach for four top program <BRK>wave from the investigation continue to wah detritus to shore a caes flow through the court system  a year ago  yahoo sport reported that the f b i  s investigation had implicated at leat   program  among them were six member of this year s round of    including three no    seed   duke  north carolina and virginia   and second seeded kentucky <BRK>so far  none have been publicly outed for transgression related directly to the f b i  case  but at least one entire region will be contested this weekend with team playing under an ethical cloud <BRK>in addition to north carolina  which avoided punishment in a massive academic fraud case only threading a legal needle  the rest of the four team midwest region includes fifth seeded auburn  whose coach  bruce pearl  wa fired tennessee in   after he lied during an n c a a  investigation  third seeded houston  coached kelvin sampson  who spent year in exile after being forced out at oklahoma and indiana over recruiting violation  and kentucky  whose coach  john calipari  led two program later forced to vacate final four appearance <BRK>not all coach and program in the field have been similarly tainted  but their mere presence at the top of the sport cloud them with suspicion  paying college athlete is a popular idea waved like a magic wand  a if that would forgive the rule breaking under the current system and not create complex logistical and ethical problem of a different sort <BRK>little of this conversation ever break through the cheer surrounding the n c a a  tournament  it is rarely discussed earnestly on cbs  which is paying the n c a a  nearly    billion a year  on average  to televise the tournament through   <BRK>the issue for fan  especially this time of year  is a matter of complicity  doe supporting certain team  or an entire enterprise known to foster unethical behavior   including  some argue  not sharing it financial rich with it labor force   condemn those who watch  cheer or fill in bracket <BRK>klein  the philosophy lecturer at arizona state  said we live in a  culture of outrage   with societal pressure to disengage from everything some find troubling <BRK> it seems an overburdened obligation that we know the moral status of every aspect of every institution and everything we participate in  and are able to figure out the proper balance to decide whether or not we should interact with it   klein said   that s just not doable  <BRK>allegiance to team are  an identity issue   he said   part of how you see yourself   not unlike a long term relationship with family and friend  fan of certain team  even if those team are clouded in controversy  tend to defend them  even if their vision is viewed through team color tinted glass <BRK> when something happens that you think is wrong  that you re morally critical of  you don t necessarily walk away from that relationship   klein said <BRK>at some point  of course  maybe you do  but haney  from the national association of basketball coach  hold a similar view <BRK> just a you can have a friend who s done something to you  but because you like them  you love them  you stay with them   haney said   you don t turn your back on them  knowing that change is coming  <BRK> fandom is not a rational pursuit from the get go   said bowen  who helped write  sport  ethic and leadership   a textbook   the joy is that it s an emotional experience  a great getaway  we want that  but on the flip side  emotion hijack reason all the time  <BRK>by the way  while he did not participate in his office pool for the men s tournament  bowen said he and his child filled out bracket at home <BRK>it is complicated  maybe like the bracket itself  no one get it exactly right <BRK>an earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified the university where will wade is a coach  it is l s u   not auburn <BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK>
