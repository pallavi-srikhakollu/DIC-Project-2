<BRK><BRK>n c a a  tournament  day  <BRK>by ben shpigel<BRK>it should not be possible for a human being listed at   foot   inch and   pound to outrun a guard while chasing down a loose ball  to fool him with a behind the back dribble and then to glide in for a layup  but zion williamson warp logic and good sense every time his size   foot step onto a basketball court <BRK>the final score of duke s victory against north dakota state doe not suggest a much  but there wa a juncture in the team  eat region game friday night when the outcome wa theoretically in doubt  the no    over all seed blue devil led   gap   only   point at halftime <BRK>duke ended up trampling the no    bison      after leading a many a    because of a sequence early in the second half in which williamson unleahed the breadth of his singular repertory  he made a shot while being fouled  missed the free throw but grabbed the ball and dunked it  rebounded a wayward north dakota shot and started a possession that ended in a duke   pointer  and then stole the ball  ran it down and dropped it in the baket  all within   second <BRK>it wa     then  and it wa over because williamson  the blue devil  bulldozing ballet dancer  had decreed it wa  williamson finished with   point on   of   shooting  and another duke freshman  r j  barrett  added   <BRK> before that even happened  my teammate were in my ear   said williamson  who relished playing in columbia  s c   about   mile from his hometown  spartanburg   they were just like   be me   like   be myself   when they re constantly telling you to be yourself  it just give you energy  and i just try to bring energy for my team  i think in those situation i just happened to be in the right spot  <BRK>by showcasing it power of devastation  duke   though it wobbled early  like the other two top seed who played friday  virginia and north carolina  and a no     tennessee   evaded the upset that pervaded what wa a more appealing second day of the tournament  the minor surprise   in the south  no    iowa beat no    cincinnati       and no    oklahoma bludgeoned no    mississippi       while no    wahington whipped no    utah state       in the midwest   paled against the win that had the capacity to upend the bracket <BRK>in dispatching no    kansa state     in the south  no    university of california  irvine preceded victory no    oregon  which walloped no    wisconsin     in the same region  and no    liberty  which stunned no    mississippi state     in the east <BRK>for a spell friday  north dakota state envisioned joining them  too <BRK> it just never felt like you were going to get beat until they really got going   coach david richman said <BRK>and they  he wa referencing williamson  who ha few  if any  peer around the nation  let alone in the bison s summit league  asked about the difficulty in preparing for a player like williamson  and with all of two day  notice  richman interrupted the reporter   is there any guy like him besides him  <BRK>for the uninitiated  the best nickname in the n c a a  tournament hail from u c  irvine  the anteater   though apparently the cognoscenti prefer an abridged moniker <BRK> we usually like to take off the  ant  and just say  eater    guard evan leonard said   so i feel like eater nation  stuff like that  is pretty cool  <BRK>also pretty cool  claiming the first significant upset of the tournament  the anteater   eater  excue u   outed kansa state to capture the program s first n c a a  tournament victory <BRK>indeed irvine had only one previous appearance   losing to louisville in     and it recent lineage is littered with strong regular season followed flameouts in the big west conference tournament  but in a dreadful season for california s men s team  one in which standard bearer like stanford  u c l a  and u s c  didn t even qualify for the national invitation tournament  the anteater have represented the golden state with distinction  going     with   straight win <BRK> we have vision of potentially growing into something greater   you know  every player dream of that  every program sort of dream of that   coach russell turner said   this wa a big step toward that tonight  you know  u c  irvine  folk  i don t know  live in the shadow  live like little brother to u c l a  and s c  and maybe some others  cal  stanford  san diego state  maybe like little brother  well  little brother ha been in the weight room  getting better  getting ready for a chance like this  <BRK>u c  irvine had not lost since jan     and to extend that streak  the anteater summoned critical   pointer from two junior  leonard and max hazzard  leonard made his shot on consecutive possession to put u c  irvine ahead to stay for the final nine minute  and hazzard drilled a shot from the corner with about   second remaining to push it lead to      kansa state  which won a share of the big   title  missed it all big   forward dean wade  injured foot  <BRK> i mean  if you studied or watched u  obviouly it s a huge difference   coach bruce weber said   but no excues  <BRK>virginia spent the last year waiting for it chance to atone for it unprecedented early exit from the   n c a a  tournament  when it became the first no    seed to lose to a no     when that chance arrived  the cavalier sleepwalked through the first half against gardner webb and found themselves confronting potential embarrassment again <BRK> that will always be part of our story   coach tony bennett said   i understand that  i m sure a lot of people thought it wa going to be part of our story the second year in a row  <BRK>virginia persisted  though  rolling to a     victory after outscoring the bulldog   point in the second half  de andre hunter   who missed that dispiriting tournament loss to maryland baltimore county last year with a hand injury   scored   point to lead the cavalier  who recognize their place in infamy but  at bennett s urging  have regrouped from it <BRK>together  they watched a video of a ted talk given in charlottesville  va   of all place  in which the speaker  discussing his personal grief  said  according to bennett  that  if you learn to use it right  it can buy you a ticket to a place that you couldn t have gone any other way   the junior guard kyle guy  who had   point friday  still keep an image of u m b c  s celebration a the screen saver on his phone and in his twitter profile  he said an author  joshua medcalf  had talked to the team lat year  telling the cavalier   be where your foot are  <BRK>even a virginia sputtered in the first half  trailing a many a    guy said he focused on positive reinforcement  bennett said the mood at halftime wa upbeat  and he aked his asistant coach to  uplift  player and not  panic  <BRK> yes  we made some adjustment that i think helped the guy out there   bennett said   but it wa  you know  don t you dare leave anything in this locker room  <BRK>the second day of the tournament began with iowa extending the big ten s stretch of dominance  a the hawkeyes pulled away late from cincinnati to win       iowa s victory improved the big ten s record to      which wa marred later when no    wisconsin lost to oregon <BRK> we ve been saying all year long that it s the most competitive league in the country top to bottom   iowa coach fran mccaffery said   and you sort of expect big ten coach to make those kind of statement  but the reality is we actually believe that  and so i think it s proving it  <BRK>the big ten this season lacked the elite status of the atlantic coast conference  which ha three no    seed in duke  virginia and north carolina  and though the conference ha sent seven team to the national championship game since    it han t won since michigan state claimed the title in   <BRK>but it depth ha been manifest so far  with two no    seed  iowa and minnesota  scoring minor upset to join two imposing no   s  michigan and michigan state  and maryland and purdue in the second round <BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK>
