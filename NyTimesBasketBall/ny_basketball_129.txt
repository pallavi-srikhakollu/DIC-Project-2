team in men s college basketball  the volunteer have won   consecutive game  the longest active winning streak in the country   but only because hofstra  on long island  got upset northeastern on saturday <BRK>that is not a misprint  from late november until the second day of february  the hofstra pride did not lose a game  and almost no one noticed  when a program like duke or kentucky win   game in a row  the team is featured on espn s  sportcenter  every night and make the cover of sport illustrated  when the hofstra pride win   game in a row  they are lucky if their fellow student even know about it  <BRK>that wa not entirely their fault  hofstra s winter break ran from mid december until the end of january  so student weren t on the long island campus for six home game  still  hofstra s average home attendance this season is      <BRK>the lack of attention ha had little effect on how the team experienced the streak  though  or it determination to begin another one  when the streak finally came to an end saturday with the defeat in boston  hofstra coach joe mihalich watched the tape of the     loss twice on the four hour bus ride back to long island  <BRK> a i said to the team   if everyone look in the mirror and say  what could i have done better   then we ll get better   mihalich     said sunday   it wa great  it wa fun  we enjoyed the ride  but it s not the end all and be all  <BRK>hofstra  which play in the colonial athletic association  ha not been to the n c a a  tournament since    because the c a a  generally receives only one bid  the pride       most likely will have to win the conference tournament in charleston  s c   next month just to qualify  winning streak  even long one  usually aren t enough to sway the selection committee when it hand out the at large spot  <BRK>hofstra s hope to win it way in largely rest with a   foot   senior guard from queen  justin wright foreman  who gave serious consideration to transferring away from the university after scoring a total of   point during his freshman year <BRK>wright foreman had expected a bigger role coming into college  then he averaged only     minute a game for a team that won the c a a  regular season title  lost in the conference championship game and qualified for the national invitation tournament <BRK> i wa kind of a big baby when i wa a freshman and i wanted everything to happen right now   wright foreman said  <BRK>he spoke to his mother  janice wright  his uncle  and to the hofstra asistant coach craig claxton  a former pride star known a speedy before deciding to stay  the decision  he said  wa in part to remain close to his ailing grandmother and his three younger brother  his mother s message   everything is going to get better in due time  <BRK>now wright foreman is averaging     point a game  third best in division    and     rebound and     assist  he ha reached double figure in scoring in   consecutive game and is now   point shy of     for his career  n b a  scout have begun to chatter about him  turning up at hofstra game even when others do not <BRK> he scored   point a a freshman  he scored   point in a game this year   mihalich said  referring to a wright foreman outing that he capped with a buzzer beating   pointer in the final second of a     home win over northeatern on jan    <BRK>he is not a one man show  though  the junior guard eli pemberton is averaging     point and     rebound  and the senior point guard desure buie average     point and     assist <BRK>still  the crowd at hofstra have been a far cry from the day when ticket scalper sold ticket to see claxton play in the late  s  back then  hofstra wa in the america east conference  and claxton wa on his way to the n b a <BRK> i don t think the community ha embraced u like that yet  and it s a shame becaue they re not going to get to see a really talented kid play   said claxton  who helped lead hofstra to the n c a a  tournament in   and later won an n b a  championship with the san antonio spur   i mean  we only have four more home game  and they really missed out  <BRK>wright foreman and his teammate don t seem bothered the lack of attention   we re just more focused on what s going on in this moment now   wright foreman said   we just want to win a lot of game <BRK>hofstra s success hasn t gone completely unnoticed  the former hofstra coach jay wright  now a national title winner at villanova  talked up his old team after a recent win <BRK> i m loving it   wright told reporter   watching every game  man  <BRK>wright also texted mihalich  saying   our entire family always follows hu   keep up the great work  proud of you  <BRK>while wright forman s teammate bonded this pat summer over monopoly game in a dormitory lounge that involved a many a seven player  wright foreman wa often in the gym working on his game <BRK>mihalich called wright foreman an n b a  level scorer   is he an n b a  defender  probably not   he said   is he an n b a  rebounder  no  but he s an n b a  scorer  <BRK>claxton said that he see parallel between this team and the     hofstra team that made the n c a a  tournament  each  he said  had a star complemented those around him <BRK>wright foreman is just glad he stayed around long enough to experience it  the streak may be over  but there s a chance to start a new one on thursday <BRK> i m happy i wa able to mature enough and just tell myself that this is where i need to be and i m just going to work a hard a i can   he said <BRK><BRK><BRK>
