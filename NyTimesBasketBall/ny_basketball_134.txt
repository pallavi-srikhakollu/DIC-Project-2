<BRK><BRK>by reuters<BRK>minneapolis   lee larkins first got his hand on kyle guy a an indiana sixth grader who might a well be shooting free throw with his eye closed <BRK> i shot with two hand  kind of like  motion his hand over his forehead and push  palm high  in opposite direction    guy  now a junior at virginia  said sunday  about   hour removed from the heroic game winning free throw that sent the cavalier to the national championship game and auburn home from the ncaa tournament <BRK>a self described slasher in middle school  guy grew into a sharpshooter  there s a jimmy chitwood    the sweet shooting hickory high school guard in the film  hoosier  for the uninitiated    on every block in indiana  where hoop is a religion and virtually all other thing take second billing  not just on winter friday in high school gym  parent get the ball bouncing on the same day they toss the baby booty <BRK>guy credit  in part  his middle school guidance counselor  larkins  guy s recollection wa larkins  who played football at purdue and later coached there after playing middle school for mike fratello  forced him to work out with him <BRK> i have two daughter and they re a little bit older than kyle  he used to come into the gym  always had a baketball in his hand   larkins told field level medium on sunday afternoon   it started a    he went against all girl  all girl and him  <BRK>larkins is not the only basketball mentor in guy s life  although he remains a constant  so when guy strolled to the line with the game hanging in the balance saturday night with     second left  the larkins family started celebrating  that included larkins  two older daughter who were part of the kyle guy construction project <BRK> he wa built for this  this is what i texted him last night  right away  my mindset is that he s knocking these three down  this is what he trained his mind for   larkins said <BRK> at the end of every workout  we shot free throw with his eye closed  he had to be at   percent  there wa no doubt in my mind  this kid is going to make these shot  that same scenario  i guarantee you  he s played it out in lawrence central s gym  it s a mindset we were trained on  <BRK>larkins only had to open the door once for guy to keep showing up at practice  he begged to be coached hard  and picked up nuance of the game on the fly <BRK>before long  larkins had no doubt about guy s destiny <BRK> we constantly worked on his shot  but he wanted to be coached and loved to be coached hard   said larkins  who now run an aau program and ha coached woman s basketball at iupui <BRK> his grandmother wa my bos  and then i told her and his dad  i said   this kid can be mr  basketball   he picked up everything  worked so hard  in my gym  i m pretty fundamentally sound  don t fade away  straight up and straight down  he picked up from there  it show now  just a really good shooter  <BRK>not everyone peered through the same optimistic lens evaluating the spindly guy  who floated under the radar of many major college program  larkins said his alma mater  purdue  wa not a fit because it already had slot filled    hello  carsen edward    in which guy would have fit <BRK> virginia wa a natural fit   larkins recalled <BRK> i tried to get him to purdue  his grandfather and great grandfather are all  indiana university  people  kyle wanted something different  he wanted to get away  and write his own story  i think that wa so much different than anyone else <BRK> virginia wa a great fit  when coach  tony bennett  came here and watched him  they were playing lawrence north at the time  you could just see the relationship he had with coach  it wa a perfect  perfect match  <BRK>the trust evident between bennett and guy paid off in a big way again saturday  but guy want his original support system to know he s taking the court for them  too  on monday <BRK> i ve been thinking about that a lot the last three week   guy said   not just what it would mean to win a championship with these guy  but to bring it home and represent my hometown and indiana  <BRK>     <BRK>meaured and reflective  guy come across a vulnerable with overtone of on court confidence  he model his openness after his coach  bennett <BRK>it might not have been evident to observer when guy  who shoot   percent from the free throw line  sealed virginia s win saturday  but he battle extreme anxiety  he looked calm  he told himself he wa calm  in reality <BRK> i wa terrified   guy said   but it wa a good terrified  <BRK>pressure typically feel like a privilege until it ha buckled you <BRK> the best thing i could do for kyle is i pray for him a lot   said bennett  who identified five biblical pillar of his program and us faith based teaching daily <BRK> i do  and i m there for him  we have a saying  be kind because everyone you meet is facing a hard battle  some thing you have to work through with yourself and the right kind of help  and he s very honest about it  i try to encourage him and challenge him in way and be there for him  coach him hard <BRK> we always talk about encouragement and accountability    being that way with him  i constantly think about him  it s an extended family  so you are a father figure  to an extent  to them  i think about that stuff  and i do that for me  that s really important for him  that s probably the best thing i could say i did  <BRK>     <BRK>historically improbable  virginia lost to umbc in the first round of the   ncaa tournament  the march   defeat wan t just an upset    it wa the first time a no    seed knocked off a no    in tournament history    it also wa an emotional landmark for guy <BRK>at the time  it felt like a landmine  the impact settled well below the surface when the team bus required a police escort back to virginia s hotel in response to death threat <BRK>guy didn t know where to turn  he went into a shell and tried to close himself off from society  the   point loss felt to guy like a nightmare from which he couldn t  and seemingly wouldn t  escape <BRK>fighting out of the pit wouldn t be a point to point venture <BRK>anxiety medication  sport psychology  session with bennett  all of it helped  nothing cured guy <BRK>he wrote himself a series of letter and ultimate liberation came through a social medium post  guy poured out his heart and soul into the emotion charged writing at the behest of fiancee alexa jenkins <BRK> when that final buzzer sounded  i cracked  i cracked and the pressure got to me   guy wrote in a facebook post   day after the umbc loss  unwinding and expelling almost     word of pulverized anguish <BRK> if you know me or read my lat pasage you know i do not believe pressure is real  unless you let it be real  pressure come from thinking too much about the future or pat so there can be such thing a no pressure if you just be where your foot are  well i wa right where my foot were but my mind raced to the pat  the future  and the present  it wa too much  i wa hit with an overwhelming feeling of sadness  anxiety  and failure  all the sensation of that exact moment consumed me and i wa no longer in control of my emotion  <BRK>     <BRK>writing became a necessary form of therapy  he shared  he asked and listened  and most important to guy  he refused to forget  it didn t take away the shame and the sting is still there    but it is now suspended intentionally the   year old <BRK>his cellphone wallpaper and twitter avatar are still set to the march       loss to umbc  soon enough  guy say he ll let it go  and if you wonder how often a   year old college athlete check a cellphone     a lot  <BRK> it still sting every time i look at it   he said <BRK>but guy crept out of his shell  he firmly belief a hand guided him here  to minneapolis  to monday night  to the precipice of a story of overcoming failure refusing to repeat history <BRK>it helped that when he felt like he wa drowning a year ago  his mom reminded him his lifeguard walked on water <BRK>he felt an unspeakable presence on the virginia team outing    white water rafting  the high class kind that might not be a wise choice for someone battling anxiety    and an unshakable calm that emerges in game with a smile that stretch to his earlobe <BRK> in a way  it s a painful gift   bennett said of how the umbc loss propelled virginia to this point <BRK> it did draw u nearer to each other a a team  i think it helped u a coach  i think it helped the player on the court and helped u in the other area that rely on thing that were significant  i knew it wa going to be a really important marked year for all of u in our life  and it s certainly playing out that way  <BRK>     <BRK>that echo helped carry guy in this very ncaa tournament  when he endured a shooting slump from   point range      of      that put the cavalier in peril in two of their first three game  then came the regional final  guy collected   point after halftime    in all  and virginia bounced purdue to reach the final four <BRK>six point in the final   second on saturday is now the string of splash play guy can recall when he rewinds his journey on and off the court <BRK> i think all of my life ha led to this  everything that i ve been through made it a lot easier to hone in and try to knock down the free throw   guy said sunday   i said that i wa terrified  it wa a good terrified  though  a good nervousness in my stomach like   this is my chance   <BRK>the climactic final chapter come monday <BRK>pressure is a privilege guy would never consider passing on this time around  imagining scissors fitted around his finger to trim the net hanging at u s  bank stadium won t bring anxiety sunday night or monday  even knowing texas tech could be the team climbing the ladder to celebrate becoming champion brings a peaceful smile to guy s face <BRK> every player and coach on every team ha envisioned it  i m sure   he said   but i think it s important to realize that you don t get to skip the game and jut go down and cut the net  we ve got to focu on what s in front of u  we ve got to practice  sunday      and jut focu  we re excited  <BRK>  by jeff reynolds  field level medium<BRK><BRK>
