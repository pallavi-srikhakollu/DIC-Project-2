<BRK><BRK>on college basketball<BRK>by marc tracy<BRK>the best game of the n c a a  tournament so far came sunday afternoon  when central florida challenged no le than duke <BRK>the blue devil tend to be front runner even in down seaon  and this is no down seaon  they are the no    overall seed  and their best player  zion williamson  is the most popular college baketball player in year  yet the knight  led their coach s son  the upset always seem to be led the coach s son   had duke on the rope all day  they held the lead a late a the game s final minute <BRK>well  duke won   just a virginia and gonzaga and kentucky and texa tech and every other no     no    and no    seed won each of their game thursday  friday  saturday and sunday  duke s two final bakets were scored it two star freshman  williamson and r  j  barrett  sometimes you can t fight city hall <BRK>such ha been the theme of this season s tournament after it first weekend and it first two round  there is a school of thought that the perfect tournament would feature all favorite winning  after all  that is exactly the point of the seed  but any casual fan   in fact  especially any casual fan   know that the unlikely win and the stunning loss lie at the very heart of the n c a a  tournament s broad appeal <BRK>it is only the second time that the top   seed were all among the   regional semifinalist since the bracket expanded to   team in    according to the tournament s medium coordinator  david worlock  two no    seed also remain   again only for the second time <BRK>if you do not trust the selection committee s seedings  then consider this  fourteen of the top   team in kenpom com s ranking a of lat monday   before the game began   are in the final    so are   of the top   <BRK>in an interesting twist  no    seed and no    seed went     in the first round  when they faced eighth  and seventh seeded team  but those are upset only an accountant could love <BRK>similarly  oregon s defeat of wisconsin in the first round wa technically a no    v  no    upset  but the duck were coming off a run to the pacific   conference tournament title  and several oddsmakers had cast the game a pick  em <BRK>only no    ohio state s     win over no    iowa state and no    california irvine s     defeat of no    kansa state qualified a the kind of clasic first round upset that aficionado of an unpredictable n c a a  tournament cherish  both lost in the second round <BRK>one thing this all mean is that there will be no out of nowhere deep run team on the order of gonzaga in    or virginia commonwealth in    or loyola chicago last year  ha someone been cleaning the eraser  because it sure feel chalky in here <BRK>so  a the ancient hebrew used to ak  why is this n c a a  tournament different from all  well  most  other n c a a  tournament <BRK>for one thing  apparently you should trust the selection committee s seedings  this wa the first year without the much maligned rating percentage index statistic  which did not account for factor like average margin of victory  and the first year with the much more comprehensive n c a a  evaluation tool  known a net  which doe <BRK>then again  the committee s still baffling decision to leave out high net  low r p i  north carolina state  now in the national invitation tournament quarterfinal  and admit low net  high r p i  arizona state  won a play in game  lost to buffalo    suggests net wa not the be all  end all  maybe the committee wa wise in other way  or maybe it got lucky <BRK>perhaps the roster of team that have survived and advanced confirms that college basketball ha reached a new degree of the winner take all dynamic  with the best coach and the best recruit congregating at fewer and fewer program   a dynamic both fed and exacerbated higher salary and one and dones   so that the top team have too much talent to be toppled <BRK>possibly  but the last time top seed made up   of the final   wa    arguably the last year before one and dones came to define college basketball  that year featured the last n b a  draft without a freshman in it top three  for instance  <BRK>it could be that the bracket is trending in a more favorite heavy direction  the tournament two year ago wa notably chalky a well  it also could be that this tendency ebb and flow  the only year since   in which all four top seed made the final four wa   <BRK>in predicting what happens next  then  we could do worse than to look at that   bracket  which is also the only other one that had three top seed from the same conference and  eerily  also featured among the   regional semifinalist the   top seed  two no    seed  a no    seed and a no    seed from the pacific    then known a the pacific    <BRK>in that year  the four top seed all advanced to the regional final  two made the final four  and one lasted through the national title game <BRK>the top overall seed  louisville  lost in the regional final to the no    seed in it quadrant  michigan state  this year  the no    seed in the quadrant of the top overall seed  duke  is  michigan state <BRK>those spartan made the national championship game only to lose to that last top seed  which had been ranked third overall the tournament selector  north carolina  this year s equivalent  the no    seed rated third overall on the other side of the bracket  is  north carolina <BRK>since then  the tar heel have been to two more national championship game  two year ago  they won one  however  a a reporter reminded tar heel coach roy williams on saturday  his team had actually gone     in their previous six second round game  they are now     in the lat seven  <BRK>williams replied with an observation that also could rebut any latent whining that there are too many highly rated team in this year s later round <BRK> ninety nine percent of the coach in the world would take that   williams said <BRK>plenty of them  he added   are sitting at home getting ready for their golf game  <BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK>
