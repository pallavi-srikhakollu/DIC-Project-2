 <BRK>  <BRK> by marc stein <BRK> the knicks shook the n b a  on thursday abruptly cutting tie with kristaps porzingis  sending the player long billed a their   foot   inch savior to the dalla maverick in a blockbuster trade that could make new york a major player in free agency this july  <BRK> the deal  which wa first disclosed the new york time  came one week before the n b a  s trading deadline and change the course of the knicks  franchise  porzingis  tim hardaway jr   courtney lee and trey burke have all been shipped to dallas in exchange for the promising guard dennis smith jr   who wa a first round draft pick in    two future first round pick and the expiring contract of the veteran deandre jordan and wesley matthew  <BRK> porzingis  who wa increasingly unhappy about the knicks  constant losing and is scheduled to become a restricted free agent july    asked to be traded on thursday  according to both a team statement and subsequent comment that knicks president steve mill and general manager scott perry made on a conference call thursday evening  <BRK> but the knicks and the maverick were already far along in trade talk before porzingis lodged that request  according to two people with knowledge of the situation who were not authorized to discus it publicly  <BRK>  a is standard for this time of year  we were exploring various option on potential trade   perry said in a statement   considering the uncertainty regarding kristaps s free agent status and his request today to be traded  we made a trade that we are confident improves the franchise   <BRK> on the conference call  mill described porzingis a a player  that no longer wanted to be part of our group   <BRK> in a farewell twitter post thursday night  porzingis said   new york will always have a special place in my heart  grateful for everybody who made this journey so special for my family and i   <BRK> dalla s willingness to acquire the contract of hardaway and lee in order to land porzingis clinched the deal and will position the knicks to create nearly    million in salary cap space this summer   enough to offer maximum contract to two of the top player expected to be free agent  golden state s kevin durant and boston s kyrie irving are frequently mentioned a knicks target  <BRK> porzingis established himself a an all star lat seaon but tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee in a game early lat february  he ha not played since and never regained his trust in the organization  which ha been waning since the final day of phil jackson s ill fated tenure a team president and could not be repaired mill  perry and david fizdale  who is in his first seaon a the knicks  coach  <BRK> even though porzingis ha been sidelined for nearly a year  dalla wa sufficiently motivated to surrender prized aset such a smith and the two first round pick  likely to be conveyed in   and    to get the deal done  <BRK> the maverick now hope to win over porzingis     keep him in dalla and make him the team s co star alongside the     luka doncic  who is only   but ha already emerged a a standout in his first seaon in the n b a  in dalla s dream scenario  porzingis  who is from latvia  and doncic  who is from slovenia  will form a partnership reminiscent of the retired steve nah and dirk nowitzki  who  at   and in his  st seaon with the maverick  may be playing his final n b a  campaign  <BRK>  we obviously think porzingis is a great young talent  similar in many way to dirk   maverick coach rick carlisle told     fm radio in dallas before his team played thursday night in detroit   this is kind of a dirk and nash type of situation  only these guy are taller   <BRK> for the knicks  being able to shed the contract of both hardaway and lee had become a priority before next week s trade deadline  a  the time reported lat week  so they jumped at the opportunity to do the deal with dalla rather than spend the next week seeing what other team might offer for porzingis  <BRK> the knicks have been regarded in league circle for some time a the foremost threat to sign durant away from the warrior in july  the deal with dalla mean they will have the financial wherewithal to do so   and likewise to pursue irving  <BRK> the knicks  with a league worst record of      are also on course to have a   percent chance at securing the top pick in the june draft  which would enable them to select zion williamson  the highly coveted duke forward  <BRK> smith wa the no    overall pick in the   draft  passed over the knicks and jackson  who drafted a different backcourt player  frank ntilikina of france  dallas ha been trying to trade smith for week  having quickly concluded that the ball dominant guard  despite his robust athleticism  is not an ideal fit with doncic  <BRK> in a timely sale job to his new employer  smith posted a career high   assist  along with   point and   rebound  in the maverick      victory over the knicks on wednesday night at madison square garden  <BRK> jordan and matthew are on expiring contract that the knicks can try to trade before next thursday s   p m  deadline  it is widely expected that both player will seek contract buyout from the knicks if they are not traded again before the deadline so they can seek roster spot with playoff bound team for the remainder of the season  yet it should be noted that jordan is one of durant s closest friend  which might factor into where he want to be in the month ahead  <BRK> porzingis  whose selection at no    over all the knicks in the   draft wa initially panned critic  made steady progress in his first two and a half seaon and wa averaging     point      rebound and     block per game at the time of his injury  perhaps a impressively  when healthy  porzingis consistently gave the impression that he had the fortitude to thrive in the intense  medium driven atmosphere that surround the knicks in new york  <BRK> there will now be immense pressure on the knicks to land player at the durant irving level to justify the trade   assuming porzingis recovers fully from his a c l  tear  kemba walker  the charlotte hornet  all star guard  is another free agent known to interest the knicks  <BRK> no matter what happens in the free agent market this summer  dalla ha furnished the knicks with two attractive draft aset  the maverick surrendered their first available first round pick    at the earliest  that ha no protection and a pick protected only through the first   choice  a early a the   draft   dalla wa not permitted to trade it top pick in the draft this june because it already traded that selection to atlanta in the deal lat june to acquire the draft right to doncic  regardless  the knicks are already looking ahead  <BRK>  we re extremely confident in the direction that we re headed   perry said  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
