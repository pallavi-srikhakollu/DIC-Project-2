 <BRK>  <BRK>   n b a  playoff preview <BRK> there are intriguing team in both conference  and there should be some classic game  but golden state is positioned to three peat   <BRK> by benjamin hoffman <BRK> the golden state warrior followed up their second consecutive n b a  title   and third in four year   adding demarcus cousin  the four time all star  it became commonplace to declare that they had ruined the league removing any suspense to the season  a starting lineup of five all star  two of which are former recipient of the most valuable player award  wa just too much  <BRK> there wa palace intrigue  however  kevin durant and draymond green feuded in public  cousin wa routinely exposed on defense  klay thompson had a rough start and stephen curry s shot seemed to fail him before he began wearing contact on the court   in a scary acknowledgment that he had struggled with his vision for year even a he established himself a the deadliest   point shooter in n b a  history   <BRK> the drama   which many on the team have said is actually le than they dealt with last season   led to long stretch in which the warrior seemed positively pedestrian  perhaps most relevant to these playoff  it led to them feuding with official  and durant and green topping the n b a  in technical foul  <BRK> it ha widely been asumed that this will be durant s lat seaon in golden state  the quirk of the salary cap mean cousin is almost asuredly gone a well  shaun livingston is likely to retire  andre iguodala can t outrun time forever  green s long term status is tenuous and thompson is about to be a free agent  this could indeed be the lat run of the warrior dynaty  <BRK> despite all of that ado  there is no reason to believe the warrior can t flip the switch and march to the final  just like they did last year  the only potential obstacle seem to be a significant injury   the team ha said an ankle injury to curry is not serious  but that situation should be monitored   or a boredom with domination so deep that they loaf their way to a shocking upset  <BRK> with cousin and durant likely hoping to add a ring on their way out the door  focus shouldn t be a problem  but first they will have to get there   <BRK> a preview of all eight first round series show there is plenty to watch and enjoy  even if golden state is still  ruining  everything   and end up the champion once again  <BRK> western conference <BRK> game    saturday    p m   abc <BRK> the clipper       were the n b a  s most surprising team all season  the lob city year may have been defined a top heavy roster of star  but this group wa far more anonymous and it talent stretched further along the bench  led for most of the season tobias harris  danilo gallinari and the bench duo of montrezl harrell and lou williams   who this season became the n b a  s career leader in point off the bench   they coasted along  winning game after game in which they were counted out   <BRK> even the clipper  management did not seem to believe in them  trading harris and boban marjanovic to philadelphia in february  the collapse that everyone predicted never happened  and the clipper easily held off sacramento for the west s final playoff spot  <BRK> but this series is where the fun story end  an overachieving team can be exhilarating to watch  and there were matchup where the clipper might have surprised someone  but no matter how bored the warrior       seemed this seaon  a loss in this series would overtake the   we believe warrior  upset of the top seeded dalla maverick a the most shocking first round loss in recent history  golden state is just too deep and too talented for the plucky clipper to stand a chance  <BRK> pick  warrior in   <BRK> game    saturday      p m   espn <BRK> don t let their record fool you   the nugget       are broken  and it doesn t take much to find the date of the fracture  jan     that day  denver  which came into the game brimming with confidence a the no    team in the west  got pulverized the warrior  the nugget allowed a record   first quarter point and lost       <BRK> the nugget went     the rest of the way   not all that different than the     record they had going into the game   but any notion that they had emerged a a true contender wa officially scuttled  two more loss to golden state helped drive that point home  a did a     record over the team s lat   game  the nugget barely held onto the no    seed  nearly losing it to houston on the final day of the seaon  <BRK> an optimist would point out that denver keeping the no    seed mean it is uniquely positioned for a trip to the conference final  a it win on wednesday kept the nugget away from golden state for the first two round  if the nugget can get pat the spur        they would draw the winner of portland oklahoma city   <BRK> nikola jokic is a truly special player  and will get a chance to shine on a national stage at some point  but even if the nugget are more talented than san antonio  it is hard to believe that coach gregg popovich can t come up with a way to exploit denver s weakness and advance in what could be one of the more closely matched series  <BRK> pick  spur in   <BRK> game    sunday      p m   abc <BRK> watching the video of the brutal leg injury sustained jusuf nurkic last month is not recommended  but understanding it impact is fairly important in these playoff  nurkic  the bosnian center  wa in the middle of a career defining season but will now miss the playoff  he helped transform the trail blazer        from a team known for it transcendent guard combo   damian lillard and c j  mccollum   into a team that seemed dangerous against any opponent in the west besides golden state  <BRK> ene kanter  who signed with the team in february after being bought out the knicks  can replace a fair amount of nurkic s offense and rebounding  but the defensive drop off could hardly be more extreme  that could leave mccollum in the unenviable position of having this notorious moment on twitter revisited  <BRK> with nurkic  the blazer likely would have been heavy favorite against the thunder        but a it stand they seem outmatched the combination of paul george  steven adam and russell westbrook  <BRK> oklahoma city is far from perfect  george s play plummeted after injury in the second half  and westbrook continued his streak of season in which he s averaged a triple double but did so with a horrific shooting line of     percent from the field      percent on   pointer and     percent from the free throw line  adam  though  should be able to swallow his good friend kanter alive on both end of the court  and the likelihood that george rise to the occasion should have portland exiting in the first round for the third year in a row  this year  though  they should win at least one or two game  for jennifer  <BRK> pick  thunder in   <BRK> game    sunday      p m   tnt <BRK> sometimes you can win losing  the rocket       went into the seaon s final day with a shot at the no    seed in the west  but denver s win left houston at no     the beauty of that  should the rocket survive a first round matchup against rudy gobert and the jazz        is that it would set them up for a face off against golden state in the second round  with james harden a fresh a possible and with a far better chance of chris paul being healthy  <BRK> but first houston will have to deal with utah  a team that get elite defense from gobert   the team wa the second most efficient defense in the n b a   allowing     point per   possession  according to basketball reference   and enough offense from donovan mitchell to stay competitive   <BRK> this rocket team is far different from the defensive powerhouse that nearly knocked off golden state in the conference final last year  trevor ariza and luc mbah a moute are missed on that end of the court  but houston managed to rise out of an early funk thanks to harden proving he had an even higher gear than the one he displayed en route to winning m v p  last season   <BRK> harden s average of     point a game wa the highest any player in n b a  history other than wilt chamberlain and michael jordan  and while he may not have averaged a triple double like westbrook  he scored   plus in   consecutive game and had two triple double in which he scored   or more point  he now owns five of the     point triple double in n b a  history  <BRK> pick  rocket in   <BRK> eastern conference <BRK> game    sunday    p m   tnt <BRK> the buck       were supposed to be good  but they weren t supposed to be this good  the season began with debate about which team in the east would step into the vacuum created lebron james s departure to the western conference  boston  philadelphia or toronto  surprise  surprise  surprise  <BRK> the story about the team  and the immediate vicinity of the basket  were dominated giannis antetokounmpo  the favorite to be named m v p  over harden  but milwaukee wa not a one man show  khris middleton wa an all star  eric bledsoe seemed content to be a third option  and brook lopez  the lumbering   footer  continued his reinvention into perhaps the n b a  s least likely   point specialist   and one of it most effective perimeter defender  <BRK> a tear in the plantar fascia of malcolm brogdon s right foot ha the buck at slightly le than full strength for the first round  but the piston       barely qualified for the playoff  and other than a fairly special season from blake griffin they offer little reason for any team to be afraid  <BRK> pick  buck in   <BRK> game    saturday    p m   espn <BRK> the raptor       were not expected to keep up with boston or philadelphia   even this writer s prediction   but they managed to jell around kawhi leonard faster than many predicted  leonard s health issue  while not entirely a thing of the past  did not stop toronto from easily winning the most difficult division in the n b a  <BRK> credit should go not just to leonard  but also to coach nick nurse  who did a solid job of competing night in and night out  to kyle lowry  who moved on  reluctantly  from demar derozan  and most of all to pacal siakam  who  in one seaon  went from being viewed a a fun role player to being called a future superstar  <BRK> that toronto is a heavy favorite is a bummer for the magic        a team that emerged from year of being atrocious and put on a good show nearly every night  the leap to all star nikola vucevic wa inspiring  and the athleticism on the roster can lead to some truly sensational highlight  yes  the raptor should win  and it s entirely possible that they will sweep  but orlando is one of the few team that could get away with an attitude of just being happy to be there  <BRK> pick  raptor in   <BRK> game    saturday      p m   espn <BRK> the  er       likely have the most talented starting five outside of golden state  joel embiid is a system unto himself   he d prefer to be called a process  ben simmons can do anything except shoot   pointer  and jimmy butler is not your friend  but he is a terrific all around player  that the sixer can complement those three with a pair of dead eyed shooter like tobias harris and j j  redick almost seems greedy  <BRK> the price  it seems  is depth and cohesiveness  the starting five ha managed just     minute on the court together over   game  while boban marjanovic is a lot of fun coming off the bench   provided you re not the one guarding him   there isn t a lot else to speak about among the sixer  reserve   <BRK> the net        meanwhile  have depth in spade  d angelo russell took the leap to all star level this season  spencer dinwiddie is one of the league s top sixth men  jarrett allen is a slender but formidable brick wall in front of the basket  and you never know when caris levert and joe harris will dominate  coach kenny atkinson managed to have   player average more than   minute a game this season mixing and matching his lineup  and dealing with injury    <BRK> the  er are rightfully the favorite  at any given point in a game they could claim to have the five most talented player on the court   with the possible exception of russell over redick and or harris  but a significant injury to any one of philadelphia s star   always a concern with this team s injury history   could be a death knell  <BRK> pick   er in   <BRK> game    sunday    p m   tnt <BRK> what to make of the celtic  the team made a run to the conference final last season with a spark but without kyrie irving or gordon hayward  and then after getting them back from injury this year they were flat for much of the season  it s not that they didn t end up with good number   they were a top   team in offensive and defensive efficiency   but they didn t scare anyone because of their inconsistency  <BRK> the warrior proved lat year that a team can meander through a regular seaon and then wake up in the playoff  this team may not be quite a talented a golden state  but the seed for a similar transformation doe appear to be present should coach brad stevens find a way to shake up his player and get them properly motivated  <BRK> if boston think it can loaf it way through this series  however  it will be sadly mistaken  the pacer       survived losing their best player  victor oladipo  to a season ending knee injury and finished with the same record they had last year while showing small improvement in their efficiency on both end of the court  <BRK> boston is so talented that it ha to be the favorite  but this is the series with the widest range of possibility   <BRK> pick  celtic in   <BRK> harvey araton    aratonhj <BRK> west
