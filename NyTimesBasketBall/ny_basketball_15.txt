<BRK>as kansa show  we are not in r p i  land anymor  and it is difficult to find close observ of colleg basketbal who do not think this is a good thing <BRK> by and larg  eyebal it  it has been better than the r p i  at measur good versus bad team   the espn tournament analyst joe lunardi said of the net <BRK>more subtl but at least as import  move from r p i  to net   even the acronym seem an improv    may have herald a shift in the select committe s philosoph underpin   the select committe for the divis i women s tournament will still use the r p i  <BRK>everi year  there is a long  loud debat when it come to select the at larg bid   the team that do not receiv automat tournament slot virtu of win their confer tournament championship  the fundament question is  in sift the candid  should the committe pick on the basi of who is  most deserv   which is to say the team that had the better season to that point  or simpli pick the  best   which is to say the team that gave other indic of overal qualiti <BRK>r p i   which essenti measur onli won lost record and strength of schedul  was a tool for  most deserv   net  which combin those r p i  like input with effici rate and margin of victori  is an argument for  best  <BRK>joel sokol  a georgia tech professor of engin who compil a colleg basketbal rate known as l r m c   note that net has more close track other advanc rates  includ his own and kenpom s main rate  which measur offens and defens effici per possess  adjust for oppon strength <BRK> it s a lot better than the r p i   a lot more reflect of how good the

we re quit pleas with how the new metric is work   he said last month  ad   there s a thousand possess that occur over the cours of a year  come down to one possess is not go to adjust your net that signific  <BRK>by contrast  the r p i  realli could be affect a singl possess  it was a good faith attempt to do two thing  situat team  record in the context of their strength of schedul  and discourag team from run up the score  but this meant that a singl bad  if close  loss or good  if close  victori could disproportion sway a team s rate <BRK>and the r p i  s myopic focus encourag team simpli to schedul good oppon  or have the good fortun  share onli major confer team  of face mani good oppon in leagu play  wors  not account for home court advantag   in a sport in which the home team win near two in three game   r p i  boost team that could afford to schedul more nonconfer home game  which  again  tend to be major confer team <BRK> depend upon the amount of money and support you have and your arena  you can basic isol yourself from the rest of the world or at least control who you play and when you play them and where you play them   said doug fullerton  who serv on the select committe when he was big sky confer commission   it s a have and have not situat <BRK>meanwhil  discourag blowout meant ignor margin of victori  which sport analyst for decad have general said is a better predictor of futur win percentag <BRK> when you play a good team  you didn t get a bonus for win   than win     sokol said  he note that kansa has an unlik     record in one possess and overtim game this season  further explain it aberr high r p i <BRK>by contrast  net factor game locat into it team valu index  and the n c a a  also sort win into quadrant base on whether they came at home  on the road or at a neutral court  and net account for margin of victori  although in a nod to sportsmanship  the stat is cap at   point <BRK> i think that s an honest attempt to tri to captur what a point spread would tell you without creat an incent for someon to run the score up   fullerton said <BRK>to see the kind of team net favor over r p i   and vice versa  consid two bubbl squad  north carolina state and arizona state <BRK>despit play in the competit atlant coast confer  the wolfpack had a dread r p i  of  rd thank to a schedul rate  th most difficult  accord to friday s realtimerpi figur  that is part the result of a confer slate featur onli four game against the a c c  s top three team   duke  virginia and north carolina   and a nonconfer schedul that began with five home court gimm  yet with close road loss to the futur low seed wisconsin and florida state as well as win over the like tournament team syracus and auburn  north carolina state s net is an emin respect  rd <BRK>on the other hand  arizona state is a classic good r p i  team  have defeat kansa and much of a middl   but r p i  boost   pacif   confer schedul  but there is much evid that the sun
