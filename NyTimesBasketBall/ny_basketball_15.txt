<BRK><BRK>on college basketball<BRK>by marc tracy<BRK>the kansa jayhawks entered the postseason with their wing clipped  having lost two star midseason   one to an n c a a  suspension  one to unspecified  personal matter    they could well sustain double digit loss for only the second time in   season <BRK>yet according to the rating percentage index statistic  which typically saturates bracketological prognostication ahead of the n c a a  tournament s selection sunday reveal  kansa wa  a of friday morning  the top ranked men s baketball team in the country   higher than kentucky  which beat kansa handily in january  higher than virginia  which had zero loss to team not named duke  higher even than duke and it baketball messiah  zion williamson <BRK>so should you start penciling kansa in a one of the four no    seed before the bracket is releaed on sunday night <BRK>not so fast  while you can still find website that calculate r p i   the statistic is officially no more in the men s game  the n c a a   which created it nearly four decade ago  disowned it in the statistic s most prominent sport last year <BRK> we a a committee have decided the r p i  is kind of yesterday s news   this seaon s selection committee chairman  bernard muir  the athletic director at stanford  said lat month <BRK>the r p i  s replacement a the first among equal rating  the n c a a  evaluation tool  put kansa all the way down at no    through friday s game  it is a shockingly large divergence that much more closely match the no    seed kansa is generally expected to receive after the committee considers not only net but other advanced stats  winning percentage  individual game result and even the eyeball test <BRK>a kansa show  we are not in r p i  land anymore  and it is difficult to find close observer of college baketball who do not think this is a good thing <BRK> by and large  eyeballing it  it ha been better than the r p i  at measuring good versus bad team   the espn tournament analyst joe lunardi said of the net <BRK>more subtle but at leat a important  moving from r p i  to net   even the acronym seems an improvement    may have heralded a shift in the selection committee s philosophical underpinnings   the selection committee for the division i woman s tournament will still use the r p i  <BRK>every year  there is a long  loud debate when it come to selecting the at large bid   the team that do not receive automatic tournament slot virtue of winning their conference tournament championship  the fundamental question is  in sifting the candidate  should the committee pick on the basis of who is  most deserving   which is to say the team that had the better season to that point  or simply pick the  best   which is to say the team that gave other indication of overall quality <BRK>r p i   which essentially measured only won lost record and strength of schedule  wa a tool for  most deserving   net  which combine those r p i  like input with efficiency rating and margin of victory  is an argument for  best  <BRK>joel sokol  a georgia tech professor of engineering who compiles a college baketball rating known a l r m c   noted that net ha more closely tracked other advanced rating  including his own and kenpom s main rating  which meaures offensive and defensive efficiency per possession  adjusted for opponent strength <BRK> it s a lot better than the r p i   a lot more reflective of how good the team are   sokol said <BRK>stanford s muir  who ha served for several year on the selection committee that pick and then seed the final n c a a  men s field of   team  this week called net  contemporary  <BRK> we re quite pleased with how the new metric is working   he said last month  adding   there s a thousand possession that occur over the course of a year  coming down to one possession is not going to adjust your net that significantly  <BRK>by contrast  the r p i  really could be affected a single possession  it wa a good faith attempt to do two thing  situate team  record in the context of their strength of schedule  and discourage team from running up the score  but this meant that a single bad  if close  loss or good  if close  victory could disproportionately sway a team s rating <BRK>and the r p i  s myopic focus encouraged team simply to schedule good opponent  or have the good fortune  shared only major conference team  of facing many good opponent in league play  worse  not accounting for home court advantage   in a sport in which the home team win nearly two in three game   r p i  boosted team that could afford to schedule more nonconference home game  which  again  tended to be major conference team <BRK> depending upon the amount of money and support you have and your arena  you can basically isolate yourself from the rest of the world or at least control who you play and when you play them and where you play them   said doug fullerton  who served on the selection committee when he wa big sky conference commissioner   it s a have and have not situation <BRK>meanwhile  discouraging blowout meant ignoring margin of victory  which sport analyst for decade have generally said is a better predictor of future winning percentage <BRK> when you played a good team  you didn t get a bonus for winning   than winning     sokol said  he noted that kansa ha an unlikely     record in one possession and overtime game this season  further explaining it aberrantly high r p i <BRK>by contrast  net factor game location into it team value index  and the n c a a  also sort win into quadrant based on whether they came at home  on the road or at a neutral court  and net account for margin of victory  although in a nod to sportsmanship  the stat is capped at   point <BRK> i think that s an honest attempt to try to capture what a point spread would tell you without creating an incentive for someone to run the score up   fullerton said <BRK>to see the kind of team net favor over r p i   and vice versa  consider two bubble squad  north carolina state and arizona state <BRK>despite playing in the competitive atlantic coat conference  the wolfpack had a dreadful r p i  of  rd thanks to a schedule rated  th most difficult  according to friday s realtimerpi figure  that is partly the result of a conference slate featuring only four game against the a c c  s top three team   duke  virginia and north carolina   and a nonconference schedule that began with five home court gimmes  yet with close road loss to the future low seed wisconsin and florida state a well a win over the likely tournament team syracuse and auburn  north carolina state s net is an eminently respectable  rd <BRK>on the other hand  arizona state is a classic good r p i  team  having defeated kansa and much of a middling   but r p i  boosted   pacific   conference schedule  but there is much evidence that the sun devil are not that good  in the r p i   they were no     in net  no      they were no    in kenpom s ranking and no    in sokol s l r m c  <BRK>both team are expected to claim one of the final at large spot on sunday  but if north carolina state get in while arizona state is left out  it will be the surest sign yet that the age of r p i  is over <BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK>
