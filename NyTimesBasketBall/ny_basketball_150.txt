draymond green feud in public  cousin was routin expos on defens  klay thompson had a rough start and stephen curri s shot seem to fail him befor he began wear contact on the court   in a scari acknowledg that he had struggl with his vision for year even as he establish himself as the deadliest   point shooter in n b a  histori  <BRK>the drama   which mani on the team have said is actual less than they dealt with last season   led to long stretch in which the warrior seem posit pedestrian  perhap most relev to these playoff  it led to them feud with offici  and durant and green top the n b a  in technic foul <BRK>it has wide been assum that this will be durant s last season in golden state  the quirk of the salari cap mean cousin is almost assur gone as well  shaun livingston is like to retir  andr iguodala can t outrun time forev  green s long term status is tenuous and thompson is about to be a free agent  this could inde be the last run of the warrior dynasti <BRK>despit all of that ado  there is no reason to believ the warrior can t flip the switch and march to the final  just like they did last year  the onli potenti obstacl seem to be a signific injuri   the team has said an ankl injuri to curri is not serious  but that situat should be monitor   or a boredom with domin so deep that they loaf their way to a shock upset <BRK>with cousin and durant like hope to add a ring on their way out the door  focus shouldn t be a problem  but first they will have to get there  <BRK>a preview of all eight first round seri show there is plenti to watch and enjoy  even if golden state is still  ruin  everyth   and end up the champion onc again <BRK>western confer<BRK>game    saturday    p m   abc<BRK>the clipper       were the n b a  s most surpris team all season  the lob citi year may have been defin a top heavi roster of star  but this group was far more anonym and it talent stretch further along the bench  led for most of the season tobia harri  danilo gallinari and the bench duo of montrezl harrel and lou william   who this season becam the n b a  s career leader in point off the bench   they coast along  win game after game in which they were count out  <BRK>even the clipper  manag did not seem to believ in them  trade harri and boban marjanov to philadelphia in februari  the collaps that everyon predict never happen  and the clipper easili held off sacramento for the west s final playoff spot <BRK>but this seri is where the fun stori end  an overachiev team can be exhilar to watch  and there were matchup where the clipper might have surpris someon  but no matter how bore the warrior       seem this season  a loss in this seri would overtak the   we believ warrior  upset of the top seed dalla maverick as the most shock first round loss in recent histori  golden state is just too deep and too talent for the plucki clipper to stand a chanc <BRK>pick  warrior in  <BRK>game    saturday      p m   espn<BRK>don t let their record fool you   the nugget       are broken  and it doesn t take much to find the date of the fractur  jan     that day  denver  which came into the game brim with confid as the no    team in the west  got pulver the warrior  the nugget allow a record   first quarter point and lost      <BRK>the nugget went     the rest of the way   not all that differ than the     record they had go into the game   but ani notion that they had emerg as a true contend was offici scuttl  two more loss to golden state help drive that point home  as did a     record over the team s last   game  the nugget bare held onto the no    seed  near lose it to houston on the final day of the season <BRK>an optimist would point out that denver keep the no    seed mean it is uniqu posit for a trip to the confer final  as it win on wednesday kept the nugget away from golden state for the first two round  if the nugget can get past the spur        they would draw the winner of portland oklahoma citi  <BRK>nikola jokic is a truli special player  and will get a chanc to shine on a nation stage at some point  but even if the nugget are more talent than san antonio  it is hard to believ that coach gregg popovich can t come up with a way to exploit denver s weak and advanc in what could be one of the more close match seri <BRK>pick  spur in  <BRK>game    sunday      p m   abc<BRK>watch the video of the brutal leg injuri sustain jusuf nurkic last month is not recommend  but understand it impact is fair import in these playoff  nurkic  the bosnian center  was in the middl of a career defin season but will now miss the playoff  he help transform the trail blazer        from a team known for it transcend guard combo   damian lillard and c j  mccollum   into a team that seem danger against ani oppon in the west besid golden state <BRK>ene kanter  who sign with the team in februari after be bought out the knick  can replac a fair amount of nurkic s offens and rebound  but the defens drop off could hard be more extrem  that could leav mccollum in the unenvi posit of have this notori moment on twitter revisit <BRK>with nurkic  the blazer like would have been heavi favorit against the thunder        but as it stand they seem outmatch the combin of paul georg  steven adam and russel westbrook <BRK>oklahoma citi is far from perfect  georg s play plummet after injuri in the second half  and westbrook continu his streak of season in which he s averag a tripl doubl but did so with a horrif shoot line of     percent from the field      percent on   pointer and     percent from the free throw line  adam  though  should be abl to swallow his good friend kanter aliv on both end of the court  and the likelihood that georg rise to the occas should have portland exit in the first round for the third year in a row  this year  though  they should win at least one or two game  for jennif <BRK>pick  thunder in  <BRK>game    sunday      p m   tnt<BRK>sometim you can win lose  the rocket       went into the season s final day with a shot at the no    seed in the west  but denver s win left houston at no     the beauti of that  should the rocket surviv a first round matchup against rudi gobert and the jazz        is that it would set them up for a face off against golden state in the second round  with jame harden as fresh as possibl and with a far better chanc of chris paul be healthi <BRK>but first houston will have to deal with utah  a team that get elit defens from gobert   the team was the second most effici defens in the n b a   allow     point per   possess  accord to basketbal refer   and enough offens from donovan mitchel to stay competit  <BRK>this rocket team is far differ from the defens powerhous that near knock off golden state in the confer final last year  trevor ariza and luc mbah a mout are miss on that end of the court  but houston manag to rise out of an earli funk thank to harden prove he had an even higher gear than the one he display en rout to win m v p  last season  <BRK>harden s averag of     point a game was the highest ani player in n b a  histori other than wilt chamberlain and michael jordan  and while he may not have averagd a tripl doubl like westbrook  he score   plus in   consecut game and had two tripl doubls in which he score   or more point  he now own five of the     point tripl doubls in n b a  histori <BRK>pick  rocket in

divis in the n b a <BRK>credit should go not just to leonard  but also to coach nick nurs  who did a solid job of compet night in and night out  to kyle lowri  who move on  reluct  from demar derozan

that emerg from year of be atroci and put on a good show near everi night  the leap to all star nikola vucev was inspir  and the athletic on the roster can lead to some truli sensat highlight  yes  the raptor should win  and it s entir possibl that they will sweep  but orlando is one of the few team that could get away with an attitud of just be happi to be there <BRK>pick  raptor in  <BRK>game

anyth except shoot   pointer  and jimmi butler is not your friend  but he is a terrif all around player  that the sixer can complement those three with a pair of dead eye shooter like tobia harri and j j  redick almost seem greedi <BRK>the price  it seem  is depth and cohes  the start five has manag just     minut on the court togeth over   game  while boban marjanov is a lot of fun come off the

domin  coach kenni atkinson manag to have   player averag more than   minut a game this season mix and match his lineup  and deal with injuri   <BRK>the  er are right the favorit  at ani given point in a game they could claim to have the five most talent player on the court   with the possibl except of russel over redick and or harri  but a signific injuri to ani one of philadelphia s star

number   they were a top   team in offens and defens effici   but they didn t scare anyon becaus of their inconsist <BRK>the warrior prove last year that a team can meander through a regular season and then wake up in the playoff  this team may not be quit as talent as golden state  but the seed for a similar transform doe appear to be present should coach brad steven find a way to shake up his
