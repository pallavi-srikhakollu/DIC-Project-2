ohio state s win improved the big ten s record to     in the first round  only wisconsin lost  to oregon  <BRK> after three double digit seed won to open the day in san jose  calif   virginia tech brought some sanity to the site  the fourth seeded hokies raced out to a fast start and led no    seed saint louis     at the half   <BRK> earlier in the day  no    seed u c  irvine beat fourth seeded kansa state   th seeded oregon knocked off no    wisconsin  and no    seed liberty upset fifth seeded mississippi state  <BRK> the only time four double digit seed won on the same day at the same

and   block to lead ninth seeded u c f  to it first n c a a  tournament victory  the road get tougher now  no    duke await on sunday  but central florida       might have some karma  or at least some inside knowledge of the blue devil  on their side  knight coach johnny dawkins played on mike krzyzewski s first final four team at duke in    <BRK> don t look now but  for the third time  today  a no    seed find itself in a first half hole  this time it s north carolina  the top seed in the midwest  it gave up     pointer in the first half and trail iona       at the break  <BRK> the tar heel shot just   percent in the first half and hit just   of   of their own attempt from beyond the arc  <BRK> rickey mcgill led the way with   first half point for iona  <BRK> it wasn t that close in the end  williamson  after blowing open the game almost single handedly in the opening minute of the second half  finished with   point  and r j  barrett had   and   rebound   <BRK> the blue devil led only four point at halftime  at      when williamson broke the game open himself  he drove on two defender for a layup and wa fouled  when he missed the free throw  he got the rebound and dunked it  moment later  williamson ran down his own steal  dribbled behind his back  and made a remarkable layup that put duke ahead      <BRK> north dakota state  which fought hard for a half  simply couldn t keep up   <BRK> the blue devil will face the winner of friday s late game   central florida or virginia commonwealth   on sunday  <BRK> liberty s caleb homesley scored   of his career high   point in the final seven minute a the flame roared back to upset mississippi state in an eat region game in san jose  calif   becoming the third  th seed to advance   <BRK> homesley led the comeback from a   point deficit  but the fifth seeded bulldog regained the lead at     on robert woodard s two free throw with     to go  <BRK> liberty s lovell cabbil jr  then made a   pointer to restore his team s lead and then went   for   from the free throw line in the final     second to help liberty earn the first n c a a  tournament victory in the program s history  <BRK> two other no    seed  murray state and oregon  also won their first round game  the n c a a  said it wa the fifth time the tournament ha had three of the four  th seed had upset a no    in the same year  the last time came in    <BRK> corey davis scored   point to help the third seeded cougar beat georgia state in the midwest region  <BRK> after reaching the national final in    houston went more than three decade without winning an n c a a  tournament game  now the cougar have tournament win in back to back season  and they are starting to resemble the program that ha five final four appearance and produced star like elvin hayes  clyde drexler and hakeem olajuwon  <BRK> fabian white had   point and   rebound and breaon brady added   for houston        which will face either iowa state or ohio state on sunday  <BRK> williamson scored six point a duke roared out of the locker room with a     run  a four point lead is suddenly    and the duke fan are breathing eaier  <BRK> williamson grew up in spartanburg  s c   about a   minute drive from columbia  where the game is being played at colonial life arena  williams played here in high school tournament game and said he never expected to play here in college  but he got the opportunity when duke wa sent to the columbia regional a the top seed  <BRK> now he is starting to put on a show for his home state fan  one of his basket during duke s run wa a put back dunk after he missed a free throw  another wa one of williamson s signature hustle steal play  <BRK> on the latter  he tipped the ball away from north dakota state s vinnie shahid  outran the point guard to get the loose ball  dribbled once behind his back and then gently finger rolled the ball into the basket  then he swished a   pointer to give him a game high   point on   for   shooting  <BRK> duke is pulling away now  and williamson is the biggest reason why  david waldstein <BRK> blue devil fan in columbia  s c   were nervous and uncharacteristically quiet with their team holding a slim       lead at halftime  the sense wa duke might have underestimated north dakota state  a tough  confident team that ha  so far  refused to back down from the challenge of facing the best team in the country  <BRK> n d s u  guard vinnie shahid said thursday that the bison planned on winning the game  and he promised he and his teammate would compete  no one paid it much notice  but so far they have  especially on the defensive end  where coach david richman had his player switching up defense and getting onto the chest of the duke superstar in the first half  <BRK> the bison did a particularly good job of bracketing duke power forward zion williamson with a small guard in front and a bigger player behind him  the point appears to be to keep duke from making high low entry pass into the big man  late in the half  n d s u  wa in a     zone  david waldstein <BRK> a     run capped a jordan goldwire   pointer finally allows duke to get it head out in front of a game and feisty north dakota state  the blue devil lead     at halftime  and coach mike krzyzewski is hoarse enough in his halftime interview to suggest he ha done some shouting and plan to do more   <BRK> still  he s got a four point lead  and williamson and r j  barrett both have   point  considering the alternative  and the fact that north dakota state played a full game in a different state two day ago  and he s got something to work with   <BRK> north dakota state s vinnie shahid lead all scorer with   point  the junior average   point a game  <BRK> a result that could be considered a significant upset according to seed   no    oregon s     win over no    wisconsin in the south region   somehow did not feel like a huge surprise  the duck had won the pac   tournament last weekend after all  and their victory friday wa their ninth in a row  payton pritchard led oregon with   point  the duck will play another upset winner  u c  irvine  in a rare   v    matchup on sunday  <BRK> buffalo beat arizona state       and while coach nate oat wa surely thrilled with the victory  he wan t a big fan of having it come at the expense of the sun devil  and his former bos bobby hurley  <BRK> buffalo lost only three time this season  and spent most of the year in the top    the team were tied at   in the first half before the bull went on a     run to take control  nick perkins and jeremy harris each scored   point for no    buffalo  which will play no    seed texas tech on sunday for a spot in the round of    <BRK> the hardest part for oat may have been the postgame handshake after the rout  oat  a former high school math teacher  got the buffalo job after serving a an asistant on hurley s staff at the school  they led the team to it first n c a a  tournament berth in    a run that most likely got hurley the arizona state job  now oat ha led buffalo back to the tournament three time on his own  but he wan t happy about a reunion  <BRK>  it s not ideal   oat said earlier this week   i don t want to coach against him  there s a reason we haven t scheduled any game against each other  it is what it is  but i d like to see him win  i m a friend of his  he gave me my shot in this business  i m loyal to him  i pull for him  shoot  i helped him with some recruit down there   <BRK> virginia spent the last year waiting for friday  a chance to atone for it unprecedented early exit from the   n c a a  tournament  when it became the first no    seed to lose to a no     when that chance arrived  the cavalier never led in the first half against gardner webb  but they persisted  rolling to a     victory after outscoring the bulldog   point after halftime  <BRK> de andre hunter   who missed last year s disappointing loss to maryland baltimore county with an injury   scored   point to lead virginia  which will face no    oklahoma in the second round on sunday  ben shpigel <BRK> admiral schofield scored   point and jordan bone added   a tennessee held off a   pointer fueled colgate surge in the second half  jordan burn carried colgate with   point  shooting   for   from the field and   of   from behind the   point line  <BRK> the cavalier have dug out of their hole and taken their first lead of the second half at      <BRK> the first major upset of the n c a a  tournament came from a commuter school perhaps best known for it quirky mascot  the no    california irvine anteater

including it current run of   in a row  the anteater were led   point each from evan leonard and max hazzard  who drilled a vital   pointer with about   second left that extended irvine s lead to

a long a possible a well  he wa saying  you don t want to just be happy being there  you want to try to win the game   ben shpigel <BRK> stop u if you ve seen this before   <BRK> could it really be happening again  a year ago  virginia became the first no    men s seed to lose in the first round when it fell to maryland baltimore county  this year  virginia a no    seed again and it is trailing again  this time to no    gardner webb  the runnin  bulldog took a     lead with     left to play in the first half  and are playing with a lot of confidence  <BRK> but who are they  and where do they come from  <BRK> gardner webb  which is in the n c a a  tournament for the first time  is located   mile from columbia  s c   where friday s game is being played  it is just over the border in north carolina  so the stand are packed with fan in red and black  and they are loving it  the bulldog have a swarming defense and they are feeding off the fan support  gardner webb made   of it first   shot  <BRK> if the cavalier were not tight coming into the game  they look it now  <BRK> third seeded texas tech shook off a slow first half to roll past  th seeded northern kentucky in the west region  jarrett culver  the big   player of the year  scored   point on   for   shooting  the red raider shot   percent from the field over all  <BRK> in one of the biggest first round victory a no

answer with this  <BRK>  i get a kick out of you guy   he said   get after somebody because you re trying to hold them accountable  i don t know what kind of business you re in  because if i wa head
