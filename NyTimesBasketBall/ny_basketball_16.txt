 <BRK>  <BRK> on college basketball <BRK> by marc tracy <BRK> minneapolis   braxton key wa in pittsburgh readying for alabama s second round game against villanova on the evening of last march    when he got an  upset alert  on his phone  virginia wa trailing the university of maryland  baltimore county  <BRK>  i wa like  there s no way  they re playing a   seed   key recalled monday night   i turned the game on  and  sure enough  they did   <BRK> virginia   for the seven of you who still don t know   lost       in the first round of last year s n c a a  tournament  becoming the first top seed to lose to a bottom seed in   year of the full size men s bracket  <BRK> key texted his condolence to virginia s kyle guy  a friend from summer basketball in year past  immediately after   he didn t text me back for a couple day   key said   i could understand   <BRK> alabama lost to villanova the following day  and villanova won the national championship  key  a cousin of the former virginia great ralph sampson  transferred to virginia and got an n c a a  waiver letting him play this season  <BRK> and on monday night  with essential contribution from key  virginia won it first national championship  defeating texas tech in overtime       just one year after that devastating  infamous defeat  <BRK>  i jut thought with our work ethic  our drive  and whatever wa fueling u from last year  about losing to u m b c   i jut thought we had a good chance to win it all   key said on the court amid the confetti  <BRK> virginia s trajectory from last year to this year ha to count among the most dramatic in sport  it player and coach  tony bennett  had to have known that anything short of a national championship this season would have been at once credited to last year s devastating defeat  <BRK> this wa particularly true after the team got a no    seed  the program s fourth in six seaon  in all six game of this tournament  the cavalier were the team with the better seed  there wa no game they were not supposed to win  even a observer doubted them every time  it wa like walking a tightrope made of eggshell stretched over very thin ice  <BRK>  not after last year   the associate head coach jason williford said   no one could have thought that we d do this   <BRK>  i don t know how we won   he added   not this  but the two prior to this   <BRK> indeed  virginia did not make it easy on it frayed nerve with a series of closer than close contest in this tournament  it trailed this year s no    seed  gardner webb  at halftime  it defeated oregon  a no    seed    point  it regional final  against purdue  wa salvaged thanks to the freshman kihei clark s pas across half the court to mamadi diakite  who forced overtime with a quick shot  saturday s national semifinal victory over auburn came courtesy of guy s being fouled on a   pointer with a second left and hitting all three free throw to put his team up one  <BRK> that left monday night s final  in which texas tech outscored virginia   in the last   minute  and the cavalier were kept alive only de andre hunter s   pointer with   second left  <BRK> effectively virginia s sixth man  key wa an important but not focal player this season  <BRK> but monday night  he played   minute   far higher than his season average of     minute  even accounting for the five minute overtime period  <BRK> he quietly led his team in rebound  with    he half blocked the texas tech star jarrett culver s layup midway through the second half  and then fully blocked culver s shot at the end of regulation  preventing what could have been a buzzer beater to doom the cavalier  he no look assisted on a guy score late in the second half  and assisted on a hunter   pointer in overtime  <BRK> key s plus minus   the statistic that state the score of the game during the minute a player played   wa     far the highest  <BRK> his role wa  if not precisely part of the master plan  then at least a foreseeable eventuality  according to a virginia coach  in many way  it all came back to u m b c  <BRK> last off season  virginia s coach saw in key not only a talented  high character player with tie to the program  they saw a   foot   jigsaw puzzle piece that fit perfectly into the team that wa taking shape after the departure of the senior isaiah wilkins and devon hall  <BRK>  he provided skill that we needed   the assistant coach brad soderberg said   we had just graduated isaiah wilkins  we needed a guy who could rebound  we needed a guy who could handle the ball  who had size   <BRK> in fact  soderberg said  there wa one game in particular from virginia s previous season that pointed to it shortcoming when it came to going small  the game in which five player  none taller than      shot   from   from deep to beat virginia   in college basketball s most historic loss  <BRK>  u m b c    soderberg said   they played five guy smaller than u and hammered u   <BRK> on monday  with texas tech s starting center  tariq owen  not playing at   percent because of a sprained ankle  the red raider elected to go small  playing lineup with le size   but more speed and mobility   than their country best defense typically deployed   it is part of why the game wa not the low scoring  unexciting slugfest that some had feared   <BRK> texa tech s tactical choice prompted virginia to go small a well  according to soderberg  and that meant many minute for key  <BRK> virginia s   humiliation and it   triumph seem destined to live on in tandem  a yin and a yang contextualizing and balancing the other  <BRK> perhaps the wedge that separate the two event is a player like hunter  who wa the atlantic coast conference sixth man of the year last season and led all player monday night with a career high   point but who did not play in the u m b c  game because of a wrist injury  or a player like clark  a freshman  or key  who arrived last summer with substantial experience yet a clean slate on a team still reeling from the previous march  <BRK>  i wish it wouldn t have happened in some way   bennett said of the u m b c  loss   now i say  well  it bought u a ticket here  so be it   <BRK> key had a le ambivalent take  referring to the documentary series about extraordinary sport happening  he said   we should definitely have a    for      <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
