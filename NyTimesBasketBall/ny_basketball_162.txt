<BRK><BRK>by the associated press<BRK>new york   the future of nba basketball could look like european soccer <BRK>tournament that take place during the seaon along with league game intrigue commissioner adam silver a a way to change the format of the nba s   game seaon <BRK>if it even keep an   game season <BRK>silver mentioned everything from shorter game to a shorter seaon friday a way the nba could make it future product better for player and fan <BRK> the format we have in place now   i m a traditionalist on one hand  but on the other hand it s   year old or so  presenting an   game season  and there s nothing magical about it   silver said <BRK> i think it s on the league office to always be challenging the way we do thing  to be paying attention to changing viewer habit  a changing marketplace  a new world of the way medium is presented  often on smaller device  le on screen  people having shorter attention span  and saying   this is an incredible game  it s never been more exciting  the athleticism ha never been greater  fantastic player coming from all around the world  but what s the best way to put the season together   <BRK>silver ha focused on player health a commissioner  opening the regular seaon earlier to reduce the frequency of back to back game  and lengthening the all star break <BRK>but player are still sitting out game throughout the seaon   either their choice or because their team are requiring it   often for reaon being listed a load management <BRK> i think a fair point from fan could be if ultimately the science suggests that   game is too many game for these player  maybe you shouldn t have an   game season   silver said   i accept that  and that s something we ll continue to look at  <BRK>fewer game could mean le revenue  unle they could be replaced something that would generate a many or more viewer  tournament could be an answer  even if   game remains the format <BRK>silver ha pointed to european soccer a something that could bring new interest to the nba offering team more opportunity to win something  instead of just having one champion <BRK> that s why i m particularly interested in looking at different kind of format   at midseason tournament  for example  play in tournament   because even accepting that player have so many mile on their body  there may be better way to present it   silver said   assuming guy are going to play   game  maybe there should be a certain number of game in the regular season and then there should be two tournament throughout the season  <BRK>he acknowledged that model would require a change of thinking in american fan  who are used to only caring about the winner of the nba final <BRK>silver also mentioned the possibility of trimming game from   minute to    which is the length of college and international game <BRK>he cautioned that none of the change he discussed after the league s board of governor meeting were close to being implemented  and would continue to be studied within the league  perhaps for a few year <BRK> part of it is jut the formality that they need to be negotiated with the player association  but even if the player association came to u and said   you guy know best  what is it you want   i wouldn t know how to answer it   silver said   i think it s going to require a lot more research  a lot more thoughtfulness on behalf of the team  player and the league working together  <BRK>___<BRK><BRK>
