unequivocally political  a nearly everything in the divided state seems to be these day <BRK>the event wa supposed to have been in charlotte in    but in march    the republican controlled state legislature pased a law  known a house bill   or hb   that invalidated local government ordinance establishing anti discrimination protection for lesbian  gay  bisexual and transgender people  it required people in publicly owned building to use restroom that corresponded with the gender listed on their birth certificate <BRK>supporter called the law a necessary public safety meaure  but opponent condemned it a intolerant  and a backlah emerged  chaing away business  convention and concert and testing sport league that are normally averse to political debate <BRK>the n b a  moved the all star game from charlotte to new orleans  the n c a a  and the atlantic coast conference removed championship game and tournament from the state  a stunning blow given the hold college basketball ha over north carolina <BRK>political scientist say the law contributed when the governor at the time  pat mccrory  a republican  lost his subsequent re election bid     vote <BRK> there wa a sense that the election wa a referendum on hb   and a verdict wa rendered   said pope mccorkle  a professor of public policy at duke university and a former democratic political consultant <BRK>a year later  with the n c a a  saying the state had   hour to change the law or lose the chance to host any n c a a  championship game through    house bill   wa partially repealed  <BRK>that wa enough for the n b a   and it ha allowed charlotte to present itself a a welcoming place  however much some activist believe the repeal did not go far enough <BRK>for sport organization  the partial repeal  known a hb   allowed them to return to the state  a growing and important market  within week  the n c a a  and the a c c  returned championship game to north carolina  and the n b a  quickly awarded charlotte the   all star game  n b a  commissioner adam silver said that he understood concern that the repeal did not go far enough but that he believed it eliminated  the most egregious apects of the prior law  <BRK>that the n b a  and the n c a a  found themselves in the middle of a pitched political brawl in the tar heel state wa fitting  sport have long been intertwined with politics in north carolina <BRK>kenan memorial stadium  where the university of north carolina s football team have played for   year  wa originally named for william r  kenan  a  th century merchant who led the massacre of dozen of black resident of wilmington  in    the university decided to name the stadium instead for his son  william r  kenan  jr   a former university trustee and businessman <BRK>in the  s  dean smith  the longtime coach of north carolina s basketball team  wa a force for integration and civil right in the state  more recently  former north carolina athlete helped end plan to return a confederate monument to campus <BRK>activist and democratic politician praise the role sport organization played in overturning house bill    but only to a point  the partial repeal overturned the portion of the law dealing with restroom but largely left the other provision intact  they see it a a le discriminatory law that is far from perfect <BRK> philosophically  it wasn t the correct fix  but it achieved a good objective   said representative deb butler  a democrat and one of north carolina s few openly gay lawmaker  she voted against the partial repeal <BRK>kathy behrens  the n b a  s president of social responsibility  said the league ha equality principle that each arena  vendor  hotel or other business the n b a  work with for the all star game is required to adhere to <BRK>among other requirement  she said  each partner must  ensure that any restroom it provides for it personnel or the general public will be open for use all individual consistent with their gender identity  <BRK>still  some state  including new york and california  maintain ban against any official state travel to north carolina  netflix recently opted to film  obx   which is set in north carolina s outer bank  in south carolina because of the bill  a lawsuit the american civil liberty union challenging portion of the bill is pending <BRK> this debate should never have been about sport   said chris brook  the legal director of the a c l u  of north carolina   basketball is something of a religion here in north carolina  but hb  and hb  at bottom are about people s life and their right to live a public life  <BRK>north carolina s political battle continue  the supreme court will rule this year on partisan gerrymandering in the state  and one of the north carolina s seat in the house of representative remains vacant because of credible voter fraud allegation  a bloody state budget battle loom <BRK>for the moment  though  sport is not on the docket <BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK>
