<BRK><BRK>on pro basketball<BRK>by marc stein<BRK>the n b a  season unofficially began with a superstar s trade demand before the superstar in question  jimmy butler  and his team at the time  minnesota  had even convened for training camp <BRK>seven month and more than     game later  magic johnson upstaged the retirement of two legend   dirk nowitzki and dwyane wade   in unbecoming fashion abruptly walking away from jeanie bus  lebron james and the rest of the los angeles lakers through a chaotic hour of unscheduled interview with the news medium <BRK>and there were countless drama and controversy between those bookend  from the houston rocket  poor start and near instant divorce from carmelo anthony     to the sad disintegration of the new orleans pelican  season after anthony davis s trade demand   to the lakers  injury driven collapse that ultimately prevented king james from reaching the postseason for the first time in   year <BRK>regular season  hardly  from butler s trade request to friday s announcement from the lakers that they were parting way with coach luke walton  it wa an exhausting ride  yet we ve finally arrived where we wanted to be all along  saturday s start of the playoff <BRK>the overriding question now  a we step off that roller coater and onto another  remains golden state centric for the fourth successive spring <BRK>can anyone out there beat the warrior four time in a seven game series <BRK>my answer remains a firm no  but what will make this postseason unlike any other  beyond lebron s absence  is the array of ancillary question sure to sprout about the future of the warrior and many of the team chasing them <BRK>only   day away  remember  is the july   start of a free agent frenzy that is bound to be strongly influenced playoff result  the principal  golden state s kevin durant  klay thompson and demarcus cousin  boston s kyrie irving  toronto s kawhi leonard  philadelphia s tobias harris and butler  milwaukee s khris middleton  charlotte s kemba walker  and orlando s nikola vucevic <BRK>just to name   past  present and future all star <BRK> i think this summer is going to be the most pivotal time in n b a  history   said charles barkley  turner sport  hall of fame analyst   it s going to dictate the next five year  <BRK>any chance the raptor have of persuading leonard to stay in canada  after month of noise suggesting that the los angeles clipper are the front runner to sign him  would seem to depend on a run to the n b a  final  the raptor are indeed my pick to get there winning the post lebron eat  but the high stake involved  along with toronto s tortured playoff history  will weigh heavily on this team despite it potential a a defensive juggernaut <BRK>the pressure is even more tangible in philadelphia thanks to the  er  all in trade for harris and butler  those two  along with the sharpshooting j j redick  are all free agent to be  it s a lot for sixer coach brett brown to manage  especially when his best player  joel embiid  may not be available for the start of philadelphia s first round series with the net because of a knee issue that ha lingered since the all star game  whisper about brown s job security  a a result  are starting to circulate <BRK>uncertainty likewise smother the celtic  who failed to even win   game and openly grappled with chemistry issue after finding the reintegration of irving and gordon hayward  the former all star swingman  far more complicated than anyone   boston official included   expected  fear of a two round injury absence for the rugged guard marcus smart don t help  with the looming specter of irving s free agency and a possible trade pursuit of davis adding to the tension <BRK>milwaukee  meanwhile  ha the statistical profile of a team that should be heavily favored to represent the east in the final and potentially take down the warrior   except for the fact that the next playoff series won the otherworldly giannis antetokounmpo will be his first  the buck are the only team in the league that ranked in the top five in offensive and defensive efficiency  but i confess to being one of those old school pundit hung up on their lack of big game experience <BRK>denver is the west s answer to milwaukee and proof a a no    seed that there were some uplifting tale to celebrate amid all of the transactional chaos and personality conflict that tend to dominate the league s slice of the social medium universe  but the nugget  own inexperience didn t just steer me away from naming them a the warrior  top threat in the conference   it make them vulnerable in round   against san antonio <BRK>it s houston  then  which stand a the team most capable of derailing the warrior  bid for a three peat  houston s problem is that a costly slip to the no    seed in the west dropped it into golden state s half of the playoff bracket  the rocket now must face the utah jazz in a first round matchup featuring the hottest  houston went      and third hottest  utah went      team since the all star break <BRK>for all the talk that the rocket may benefit from a rematch with the warrior in the conference semifinal rather than the west final  when james harden and chris paul are theoretically fresher  it may actually be golden state that benefit the most from watching houston and utah beating each other up so early <BRK>the warrior won t refuse the help  either  because their veteran and coach would undoubtedly argue that their regular season grind is longer than anyone s after four consecutive trip to the championship round  ceaseless speculation about durant s potential free agent defection to the knicks or the net   yes  i m indeed warning you now not to sleep on brooklyn   ha only added to coach steve kerr s daily challenge to keep his team focused <BRK>another warning  don t forget that the warrior tend to find that focus quickly once the calendar flip to the postseaon  so many of their lat   game were billed a uncharacteristically joyless  but golden state is     in the playoff since adding durant <BRK>a long a stephen curry s ankle scare earlier this week scare prof a minor a it appeared  bank on the warrior to become the first team in   seaons   out of the   team to reach the playoff in that time   to make a fifth straight final appearance  and then snag title no    to cement themselves a indisputably dynatic <BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK>
