 <BRK>  <BRK> virginia    auburn     final four <BRK> by marc tracy <BRK> minneapolis   there is winning while being outplayed  next there is snatching victory from the jaw of defeat  then there are several other gradient of good fortune  and only then is there what virginia did on saturday night at the final four  <BRK> it     victory stunned auburn  which minute before the end appeared to have the game sewn up  and sent the top seeded cavalier to their first national championship game  they will play texas tech  which upset michigan state on saturday night  in the final on monday night  but the way virginia got there wa something to behold  <BRK>  read about texas tech s upset of michigan state here   <BRK> giving up a   point lead in the last five minute letting fifth seeded auburn score  eventually    straight point  the cavalier then cut the tiger  lead to a single point when the junior kyle guy hit a   pointer with   second left  <BRK> fouling immediately  virginia put auburn guard jared harper on the line  where he made his first free throw and missed his second  after a timeout  and a double dribble violation that replay showed the referee missed  and another time wasting foul auburn  virginia got guy a relatively open look in the left corner at the buzzer  guy missed the shot  the game appeared to be over  auburn had won  <BRK> but before guy returned to the floor  a whistle  a foul  and sure enough  on the television replay  there wa the auburn junior samir doughty defending guy  arm straight up but his body colliding with guy s a he releaed his shot  in other word  it wa not the kind of foul that necessarily affected the shot s trajectory  but it wa a foul nonetheless  <BRK> guy  an     percent free throw shooter now presented with three free throw to give his team the lead  and almost certainly the victory  made the first two  auburn called a timeout  the team huddled  and then returned to the court  guy made the third  there wa     of a second left  not enough for auburn to so much a get off a shot before the buzzer  game over  virginia win  <BRK>  i think it wa a tough call   harper said afterward   but that s not where we lost the game   <BRK>  this will be a memorable game   added auburn coach bruce pearl   and i d like it to be remembered for a great game  let s not remember this game because of just how it ended   <BRK> virginia        which wa appearing in it first final four since the n c a a  tournament expanded to a   team bracket in    will play for the championship only one year after it team became the first and only no    seed to lose to a no    seed in the history of the men s tournament  the cavalier have carried that loss around all season  now they are a game from atoning for it in the best possible way  <BRK>  to think this time last year we were starting our spring workout   virginia s ty jerome said   and to still be playing at this point in the season with  after tonight  one other team in the whole country on the stage that you dreamed about since you were a little kid  it s an unreal feeling  we re going to do everything we can to finish the job   <BRK> it is not an accident that virginia won at a higher clip than any other team this year  even if it is infrequently pretty and never flashy  and even though  in it regional final against purdue  virginia s win required an improbable buzzer beating shot and overtime  that s because virginia doe the boring thing well  take care of the ball on offense  stay disciplined on defense and doe what it is supposed to do  <BRK> guy s late   point shot  the one he made  resulted from an elaborate play involving a series of screen  the even later   point shot  the one he missed while being fouled  came on an out of bound play  in which the redshirt junior mamadi diakite wa the first look inside for a lob   similar to the catch and shoot attempt with which he sent the purdue game to overtime  when he wa not open  the play turned into  a diakite put it afterward  an informal play known a  kyle get open   <BRK> in their first final four  the tiger       had acquitted themselves well  coming out of halftime  auburn led    virginia had been     when leading at the half this season  but only     when it trailed  auburn wa playing how it wanted to play  with guard harper and bryce brown driving to the basket early in the shot clock and attempting to finish at the rim or kicking the ball out for a deep shot a teammate  <BRK> but auburn squandered that lead over the first five minute of the second half  and it trailed   when it called timeout with a little more than five minute left after jerome hit a jumper a the shot clock expired   the platonic ideal of an offensive possession for virginia s deliberate offense   the sophomore de andre hunter scored from the post and then jerome hit his fourth   pointer of the game  <BRK> hunter finished with   point  and jerome led all scorer with   point  and added   assist and   rebound  diakite led all player with five block  <BRK> auburn s comeback wa led brown  who hit his second  third and fourth   pointer of the game during the late surge  he finished with   point  <BRK>  we jut figured we had to get stop   harper said   we didn t start the second half that well defensively  we let them do what they wanted  being able to climb back in the game and get in that position wa great for u   <BRK> the production wa overdue for auburn  one of the top   point shooting team  after it went   for   from beyond the arc in the first half against virginia s deep shot denying  pack line defense  the tiger finished   for   on   point attempt overall  <BRK> virginia did not do itelf any favor a it lead first dwindled and then disappeared  it turned the ball over on a shot clock violation  it gave up two offensive rebound  hunter committed an offensive goaltending violation  diakite missed two free throw  <BRK> trailing with le than   second left and not yet in the bonus  virginia had to foul three time before auburn finally went to the free throw line  where anfernee mclemore hit both free throw  <BRK> then it wa guy s   pointer  harper s free throw  then the shot in the corner  the foul  and the ending  unforgettable and devastating  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
