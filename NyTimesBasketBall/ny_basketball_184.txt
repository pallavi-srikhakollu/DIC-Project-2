pretty much any way  really  really stepped up in the big moment  <BRK>jackson began her career at north carolina state but fractured her foot early in her freshman season  ending her year  she decided the wolfpack offense wa not a good fit and transferred to louisiana state  sitting out another season because of n c a a  rule  she wa one of the tiger  top player  but during her time there  they did not advance beyond the first round of the n c a a  tournament <BRK> i wanted to win   jackson said about her decision to come to baylor  she had never played point guard at this level until this season   i wanted coach mulkey to push me to become the best player that i can be  and she s really done that  i couldn t have written a better story  <BRK>the lady bear got off to a searing
