 <BRK>  <BRK> virginia    purdue     overtime <BRK> by joe depaolo <BRK> louisville  ky    they could hear the whisper  one year after taking one of the most infamous defeat in n c a a  tournament history becoming the first no    seed to lose to a no    seed  the virginia cavalier came back stronger than ever  they won the atlantic coast conference regular season  and still there were skeptic  earning the no    seed in the south region did little to quiet them  <BRK> they play ugly  the critic said  they do not have the offense to prevail in a key tournament game  sure  they can play defense  but that won t be enough in march  <BRK> after a first round scare against gardner webb  yet another no    seed  the cry grew louder  no way could this squad cut down the net in louisville  no way could virginia make it to minneapolis and the final four  <BRK> oh  how wrong those skeptic were  virginia  in an overtime thriller  turned back third seeded purdue       to punch it ticket  <BRK>  i don t care about the critic   cavalier coach tony bennett said  adding   i just know it wa really hard to lose in the first round  it stung  it wa  a i said  a painful gift  it wa so humbling but it drew me and drew our team closer in a way we couldn t have gone   <BRK> it first appeared a if the game would be played at purdue s pace  both team scored on their first four possession  with purdue taking an     lead just   minute   second in  and a virginia team that had allowed more than   point only three time this seaon appeared to be on it way to yielding far more  <BRK> but the hot shooting soon ceased  and empty trip became the norm  virginia scored just   point in      which allowed purdue to edge clear and take a     lead  the double digit advantage prompted raucous  boiler up   chant from the purdue faithful  they sensed a foe on the rope  a quick knockout in the offing  <BRK> the cavalier  though  clamped down  giving up just   point over the lat     of the first half to get back in the contest  even ryan cline   the purdue senior guard who seemed a if he could not miss during thursday night s regional semifinal  and who on saturday picked up where he had left off   began to cool off  only carsen edward found success for the boilermakers on offense in the first half  putting up   point en route to a game high    <BRK>  never do i feel like i m choosing to carry the team   edward said   it s just i felt good and had rhythm on the shot i wa taking  and they were just able to go in   <BRK> little little  virginia ate into the deficit  whittling it to   at halftime       the cavalier survived a poor shooting half from one of their key scorer  kyle guy  who went just   for    they also nearly lost him when he took a bad step and wa left clutching his ankle and writhing in pain  but guy  a junior guard  made it to the sideline and wa able to return after his ankle had been taped up  <BRK> good thing for virginia  because guy found his stroke coming out of the locker room  one   pointer  then another  then another  the cavalier  once   behind  were now   point to the good   leading     with     to play  <BRK> but edward wa inspired to match guy s sharpshooting with a   point hat trick of his own   on three straight trip  to boot  after the last of them  which brought purdue to      edward turned to the boilermakers  contingent and offered a nod of acknowledgment  he wa determined to carry his squad across the finish line  <BRK> so too wa guy  who finished with   point  back and forth the two star went  for a time  it seemed a if they were the only two on the floor  they made shot from everywhere  <BRK>  he s got nothing to hang his head on   guy said of edward  calling him a  bad dude   <BRK> guy added that it wa a  performance for the age him  and both team   <BRK> after trailing for almost all of the second half  purdue took the lead on a rare edward miss  a nojel eatern corralled the rebound and laid it in  giving the boilermakers a     edge with     remaining  <BRK> virginia reclaimed the advantage  but edward banked home a   pointer to put purdue up       with     left  purdue appeared to have the contest under control after grady eifert hauled in an offensive rebound with   second to play  the superb shooting cline wa fouled with a chance to make it a two possession game  but a miss kept virginia alive  trailing      purdue coach matt painter ordered his club to foul  putting ty jerome on the line for the cavalier with     second to play  <BRK> what followed  madness  after jerome made the first free throw  the second clanked off the iron and bounded into the backcourt   where kihei clark chased it down for virginia  clark took two quick dribble and then launched a rocket of a pas nearly   foot downcourt  where it wa cradled the junior forward mamadi diakite  and just before the clock hit      diakite drained an   foot jumper to  unfathomably  square the contest at      <BRK>  we had the ball in the guy s hand that we wanted  clark had the ball   painter said  adding   with that being said  he made an unbelievable play to find diakite   <BRK> on to overtime  and the game slowed down to virginia s preferred pace  neither team gained separation  with the margin at le than   for much of the extra period  a layup de andre hunter put the cavalier ahead      with   second to play  <BRK> there wa no doubt who would take the last shot for purdue  it wa edward  but the stifling defense of the cavalier owned the moment  and edward s   point heave clanked harmlessly off the iron with eight second left  <BRK> the crowd  predominantly filled with purdue fan  fell into a hush  and virginia  finishing with four free throw  silenced it doubter  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
