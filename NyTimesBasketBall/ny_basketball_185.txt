<BRK><BRK>by billy witz<BRK>minneapolis   here it wa  the first final four appearance for texas tech  and a recipe for disaster wa unfolding  the red raider  best player  jarrett culver  wa missing in action  unable to locate his shot or his confidence  their most dynamic player  tariq owen  had injured his ankle and had to be helped off the court  their double digit lead had been cut to a single point <BRK>no matter  though  for texas tech <BRK>the red raider leaned on their defense  a deep reservoir of resolve and the cocksure shooting of guard matt mooney to hold off michigan state       and advance to the n c a a  championship game on monday night <BRK>texas tech       will meet virginia        which stunned auburn and  like the red raider  will be making it first trip to the title game <BRK> read about virginia s victory over auburn here  <BRK>helping texas tech through wa mooney  who scored   point   including three second half   pointer   and a defense that ha carried the team this far <BRK>and then  when texas tech needed him most  culver delivered too  scoring two basket late  including a   pointer from the top of the arc that pushed the red raider lead to     with   second left and repelled the final michigan state charge <BRK> we threw a lot of punch out there tonight   texas tech coach chris beard said   we battled  we contested  <BRK>michigan state wa the only team to arrive at this year s final four that might have been expected not to have jitter  texas tech and auburn had never before reached a final four  and virginia had not been since    but the spartan are almost placeholder in the event  having been eight time in the last   season under their hall of fame coach  tom izzo <BRK>they have won only once in that span  however  and that title in   is now a long ago bookend to the championship magic johnson delivered in   <BRK>the spartan  star point guard  casius winston  who had played so splendidly throughout the tournament for michigan state  wa held largely in check texa tech s stifling defense  though he led the spartan with   point  he made only   of   shot and had twice a many turnover     a asists      kenny goins  who made the game winning shot to beat duke  did not score at all <BRK>the   point were a season low for michigan state  which followed gonzaga  michigan  buffalo and northern kentucky in being shackled the red raider <BRK> in general  the tougher team won   izzo said   give them credit  i really appreciate how hard his guy play  my guy hung in there  but our two senior struggled tonight  they gave u so many great moment  but tonight wasn t one of them  <BRK>if saturday s first national semifinal wa always going to be a study in contrast   virginia s methodical precision against auburn s organized chaos   the second game wa not <BRK>michigan state  which ha long built it identity around mental and physical toughness   izzo used to have his player put on football helmet and shoulder pad for rebounding drill   met it rare equal in texas tech <BRK>the red raider have hung their hard hat on a grinding defense that is rated a the most efficient in the nation  according to kenpom metric  in a typical   minute practice  the player said    are spent on defense <BRK>on saturday night  texas tech  with it persistent switching  relentless movement and extended arm made every pas a chore for michigan state  and when the spartan did manage to work the ball inside  owen   a spindly   foot   senior with a   inch vertical leap   regularly contested shot at the rim <BRK>but when owen swatted away a drive to the baket winston early in the second half  his third block  he rolled his ankle a he landed and crumpled in a heap  owen wa helped off the court  favoring his right leg  and taken to the locker room <BRK>he came back out of the tunnel and returned to the bench with about eight minute to play  bringing the texas tech crowd to it foot  they roared again when owen checked in with     left  but the lift he gave the red raider wa mostly spiritual <BRK>with owen immobile and culver ineffective  the reserve brandone france and kyler edward kept the red raider afloat with drive to the basket until mooney took over <BRK>a graduate transfer who began his career at air force and south dakota before arriving in lubbock  mooney made three   pointer during a three minute stretch  the final one giving the red raider their biggest lead  at     <BRK> all year long we d have different guy step up and jarrett s a special player   said mooney  who had received a nudge from the assistant coach glenn cyprien to be more aggressive   he said   it s your time  other guy aren t finding their shot right now  you ve got to take over this game   you don t tell me twice to shoot the ball  <BRK>but the spartan  a auburn had against virginia in the first game  crept back <BRK>and just after mooney missed a driving layup  aaron henry knifed through the lane at the other end to bring michigan state within a point  at      with     to play <BRK>it wa a surge reminiscent of the one gonzaga made against texas tech in the west region final <BRK> stay poised  be tough   norense odiase  who did not take a shot but grabbed nine rebound  said of the mind set his teammate carried down the stretch   everything that helped u get to this point  we can t jut let it go to waste jut becaue in this game they made a run  <BRK>and so the red raider stiffened  culver  who did not score his first basket until     remained and missed   of his first   shot  scored on a jumper just outside the lane to push the advantage back to     <BRK>then davide moretti drew a charge from winston  and matt mcquaid missed a   pointer  xavier tillman missed the front end of a   and   and then wa stripped odiase <BRK>it wa then left to culver to deliver the final blow  dribbling down the shot clock and knocking down his   pointer  a he did  he gestured to the red raider  crowd  which included it most well known athletic alum  kansa city chief quarterback patrick mahomes <BRK>a unlikely and improbable a it might have seemed  texa tech wa headed to the title game <BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK>
