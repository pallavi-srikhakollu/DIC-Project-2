 <BRK>  <BRK> by the associated press <BRK> oakland  calif    demarcus cousin shove off assistant coach jarron collins and go hard for the basket  he swish a   pointer from up top  then hit a jumper inside the arc on the right wing  cousin drive to the hoop and make a shot from close range  then a turnaround jumper go in before he move to the left side to begin the sequence again  <BRK> long before the rest of the golden state regular have taken the court for pregame warmups  there is cousin  earbuds in  meticulously focused on his preparation  in the locker room  he is one of the first to pull on his game jersey  <BRK> cousin can t wait for his first playoff chance  <BRK>  it s been a long time coming for him   collins said   i definitely think he s excited and he s ready for the moment to play on the biggest stage  obviously there s a lot that go into it  the preparation  the dedication   <BRK> this is why cousin approached the warrior last summer and asked for a chance  even though he wa working back from season ending surgery for a torn left achilles tendon  cousin joined the two time defending champion for      million  a low risk move for general manager bob myers that ha worked out beautifully for both side  <BRK>  i never thought this situation would happen  but it s happened   cousin said   this is my team  and anybody that s followed me before this moment  you know how i fight for my team  it s the same thing  step on them  you re stepping on me   <BRK> cousin patiently worked back from a nearly yearlong absence after getting hurt in january   with new orleans  calling it one of the hardest thing he ha gone through emotionally and physically in his career  he made his warrior debut jan    on the road against the clipper  showing quickly he would make a big impact on both end of the floor  <BRK> the four time all star center s shooting stroke returned in a hurry  for him  finally getting back wa largely conditioning and gaining strength in the leg to handle the rigor  pace and low post pounding of an nba game again  <BRK>  what doe he call it  the resurgence   stephen curry said       we like his fire  in term of the playoff  it s going to be amazing  it s his first run  it s going to be good   <BRK> the   year old cousin steadily found a groove and more minute in coach steve kerr s rotation  he no longer glare at the coach for taking him out of game  <BRK>  he ha been so much fun to coach   kerr said   and i wouldn t have said that before he came back when he wa rehabbing  he wa not that much fun to coach  he would agree with that  he wa so frustrated from the injury and from not being able to play and the length of his rehab  since he returned and since he s grown comfortable with the injury  with the comeback and since his confidence ha grown  he s been amazing to coach  <BRK>  he s a fantastic human being  a great teammate  you see his frustration and his passion on the court so people automatically sort of attach label to him  what i see is passion and emotion because he want to win   <BRK> teammate shaun livingston can only imagine what cousin  first playoff will mean after a nine year wait  and after all the hour of rehab  livingston ha lived through the grueling recovery from a major injury like cousin just endured  <BRK>  we re all going to be excited for him  and he s going to be excited   livingston said   i expect him to have a great playoff because he show up big in big game   <BRK> livingston s left leg could have been amputated   year ago  and the knee injury he suffered while with the clipper in   wa so serious nobody knew if he d walk again let alone play basketball  going for a layup  livingston s leg buckled backward  parallel to the court  when he fell in a freak accident  <BRK> so  he can certainly relate to cousin  comeback challenge  livingston offered an encouraging word whenever cousin seemed to need that boost or encouragement  <BRK>  it s pretty gratifying to see that      it feel good to see somebody that  you go through the struggle and then you re able to come back and have success at this level   livingston said   put in a lot of work  more importantly what is fulfilling to see is to see the hard work pay off  because i remember the hard work he s put in  getting to the gym early  getting his routine in  he s put in a lot of work into his body so he could come out and play and perform on the court   <BRK> cousin ha taken his offensive game to another level  finding a rhythm in golden state s offense and finding the open teammate with solid ball movement  before his return  cousin insisted he understood how thing might be in a starting lineup of all star   it s obvious i won t be taking a many shot a i have in the pat   he said  <BRK> he is dangerous from anywhere  shooting the    moving well and drawing defender to him  one of the nba s most dominant big men when healthy  he is taking charge on the defensive end and altering shot  <BRK>  i never doubt demarcus  he s another guy that s got great pride  great competitor   nugget coach michael malone said   he s always just wanted to be a part of a winning team and a winning organization  now he ha that here  he s a guy that he often get overlooked because of the amount of talent and depth this team  <BRK>  you worry about this team at the   point line  well demarcus is a guy that in the playoff you can go to and pound the ball inside into the post  he s going to score  get fouled  or create a double team and find an open teammate  what a great luxury to have   <BRK>
