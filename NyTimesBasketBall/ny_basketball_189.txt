<BRK><BRK>n c a a  tournament  day  <BRK>by ben shpigel<BRK>the scare came one after another on thursday  paroxysm of bracket busting possibility that stimulated hope of buzzer beating upset and overtime delight  those traditional trapping of march  the scare came early and late  they hovered and they lingered  and then  ala  they faded <BRK>instead of a mayhem packed opening to the n c a a  tournament  what unfolded across the four venue wa not quite boring but rather anticlimax  for all the close game and potential for chaos  only four lower seeded team won  and one   no    murray state  which throttled no    marquette       wa about a fahionable a an upset pick a a burberry raincoat <BRK>in the evening session  the first four game featured two that were effectively over at halftime  or before  no    kentucky thrashed no    abilene christian       in the midwest region  while no    gonzaga clobbered no    fairleigh dickinson       out west <BRK>another no     new mexico state  could have joined the racer in the next round had capitalized on what could be kindly described a late incompetence no    auburn  which escaped with a     victory in the midwest region  the tiger  coach  bruce pearl  might have used other choice word in private to explain how his team   which ha won nine consecutive game  including the southeatern conference tournament   nearly bungled an   point lead with le than two minute remaining <BRK> we obviouly panicked   pearl said   and made our share of mistake which could have cost u the game  <BRK>the aggies  who had not lost since jan    and finished the seaon      drew to within   point with six second left  then  the blooper reel unspooled  in that span  auburn allowed a  j  harris to reach the baket unchallenged  fouled terrell brown on a   pointer  awarding him three free throw  swatted the rebound of brown s lat free throw out of bound  giving new mexico state possession with     second left  and on the ensuing inbound play failed to cover trevelin queen  who airballed an uncontested   pointer a time expired <BRK>for his part  harris  even though he could have tied the score with a layup  passed the ball to brown  he said  because he wa open <BRK>a brown  the aggies  best   point specialist  releaed the shot  auburn s bryce brown slammed into him  with terrell brown on the foul line  auburn guard j von mccormick put his hand to his throat  making the universal symbol for choke <BRK> i saw in his face he wa pretty scared   mccormick said <BRK>in the aftermath  new mexico state coach chris jan said he understood that harris would be second guessed for kicking out the ball to brown instead of trying for a layup himself <BRK> obviouly at that point  it is out of your control and you have to trut your player and player make play   jan said   if he doe make all three free throw or make the three  it is an ali farokhmanesh moment    northern iowa s farokhmanesh once beat kansa  then a no    seed  with a   pointer    and that will be remembered forever  that s what happens in the n c a a  tournament  i trut my player  player make play  and it didn t work out for u this particular time  <BRK>pearl said he told the tiger afterward that no matter who they play next   that would be no    kansa  which pounded no    northeatern       would be just a good a the aggies <BRK>such parity every year tends to infiltrate the tournament  minimizing the gap between mid major darling like belmont and big   behemoth like maryland  no    belmont  which qualified for the tournament a an at large team after losing in the ohio valley conference final to murray state  led at halftime  and late in the second half  before losing it eat region game       to the sixth seeded terrapin <BRK> there s a reason they re the second highest scoring team in the country   maryland coach mark turgeon said   they re almost impossible to guard  <BRK>almost impossible  maryland exploited it size advantage   jalen smith had   point and   rebound  while bruno fernando added   and     to score the first   point after halftime  but belmont got to within a point in the closing second  playing for a final shot  the bruin tried executing a back door play to dylan windler  who led the team with   point  hounding guard grayson murphy  maryland s eric ayala deflected the pas  and darryl morsell  grabbing the ball  wa fouled with     second left <BRK> coach were screaming   back door    morsell said   i kind of knew it wa coming  <BRK>ja morant   the once underrecruited high school guard who ha become an n b a  lottery lock   had   point    rebound and   asist a murray state  the  th seed in the west  thumped marquette <BRK>morant s triple double wa the first in the n c a a  tournament since draymond green  the golden state warrior star  did it with michigan state in    three teammate joined him with double digit point total  led the freshman tevin brown  who scored   point <BRK>it wa morant s performance  though  that will be remembered  even if the victory wa plainly a team effort murray state  morant wa the first day s undeniable star  making pass of unsurpassed creativity   to the point that his teammate could not always handle them <BRK> you know  ja morant make a lot of plan look bad   said marquette coach steve wojciechowski  himself a former point guard  at duke   i mean  i ve been in this for a while  he s a good a any guard that i ve coached against  or played against  and i ve coached against and played against some outstanding one  <BRK>nearly a impressive   o k   maybe not   wa how  th seeded florida avoided an egregious collapse before winning       in the west  the gator scored the final seven point to silence the no    wolf pack  who had   comeback victory when down at leat   point since   and  after trailing   with   minute remaining  sliced florida s lead to   <BRK>villanova lost four critical member of it championship team to the n b a  draft afer last season  but the inexperienced wildcat managed not only to capture the big east title but also their opening round game thursday  outlasting st  mary s     in the south region  the no    wildcat endured the  th seeded gael  slow pace  playing at a tempo coach jay wright called  excruciating   to win for the  th time in   n c a a  tournament game  villanova anticipated a close game against st  mary s  and coming off the conference tournament  where the wildcat won their final two game a combined   point  they felt comfortable in those circumstance <BRK> st  mary s is one of the best in grinding out like that in close game   said guard phil booth  who led villanova with   point   you saw what they did against gonzaga in their conference tournament  so the big east really helped u for that  <BRK>l s u  never trailed against yale but still had to fend off a spirited second half surge to win       the fourth seeded tiger scored the game s first nine point and led   point in the second half before the no    bulldog pared that deficit to a few   with le than a minute remaining  skylar may  one of four tiger to score at leat   point  went   for   from the foul line in the final   second to boost l s u   which played a third straight game without it coach  will wade  who is suspended after being connected to a recruiting scandal <BRK>uncharacteristically poor shooting doomed yale  the bulldog entered thursday a one of division i s best shooting team but made only     percent of their attempt and  until drilling four in the final minute  only four of their first     pointer <BRK>no    minnesota recorded the tournament s first upset straying from it identity  the gopher  one of division i s worst outside shooting team  buried seventh seeded louisville       with a barrage of   pointer that left the cardinal dumbfounded <BRK>expecting the gopher to feed the ball inside  louisville struggled to adjust a minnesota instead drilled one   pointer after another    in all  after making his fifth  which put the gopher up     with under   minute left  the freshman gabe kalscheur  backpedaling  strummed his finger a if playing guitar   he can do whatever he want if he hit five three   minnesota coach richard pitino said <BRK>minnesota advance to play a familiar opponent  it big ten rival michigan state  which trampled the gopher   point in february in the team  only meeting this season  the second seeded spartan needed a late surge to stifle no    bradley      <BRK> i m proud of this team until i get back to the hotel and then it s going to be dog eat dog until saturday   michigan state coach tom izzo said <BRK>with maryland  michigan and purdue also winning thursday  the big ten wa off to a     start  ohio state  iowa and wisconsin will try to
