the final lineup of the night includ alex caruso  a   year old guard who spent most of the season in the n b a  s development g leagu <BRK>caruso know thing were not suppos to be this way  his mere presenc   in a crunchtim situat  no less   was a vivid sign that the season had gone sideway for the laker  who will be watch the playoff from various vacat destin <BRK>caruso also know that the laker are play fair meaningless game  includ sunday s     victori over the sacramento king  the laker       have nine more of these to go  start tuesday against the washington wizard  the buzz of lebron jame s first season as a laker is gone  the roster will be overhaul again this summer as the franchis  which has not been to the playoff sinc    rummag for solut <BRK> but for me   caruso said   these game are realli meaning  <BRK>the laker are search for motiv wherev they can find it  especi as they head toward an off season of uncertainti  coach luke walton s job status is tenuous at best  and   player on the current roster do not have guarante deal for next season  some of them  like caruso  are tri to showcas their skill in hope of acquir n b a  work next season <BRK> i think this littl stretch has been realli good   caruso said   becaus it s final allow me to put all that work i ve put in over the last two year and show how much i ve evolv as a player  that i m gain confid and make stride to get better and better   in   appear for the laker this season  caruso has shot     percent from the field  averag   point and     rebound <BRK>even player who figur to be a part of the franchis s futur are focus on person growth  a team is alway a collect of individu  but the laker  late season emphasi on  me  is particular understand <BRK> i need to use these game to develop myself and play with the ball more   the second year forward kyle kuzma said recent <BRK>the laker were not yet mathemat elimin from playoff content when they lost to the knick at madison squar garden on march     that would happen five day later   but kuzma stood his locker in a red leather jumpsuit after the game and spoke about the immedi futur <BRK> i m just tri to use these last      game   whatev we have   to just tri to develop good habit   he said   season s pretti much over  so that s the onli thing i can realli do  everyon know i m a good scorer and i can do that  i m just tri to complet my game  <BRK>then there are the injur player who have larg disappear from view  lonzo ball  brandon ingram  josh hart  for them  the end of this season is about rehab for the next one <BRK>after all the loss  injuri and general dysfunct  walton continu to preach the import of team play  same as ever <BRK> it start with our effort and how we play and how we compet   he said   and our guy have been do a nice job of that  even though we haven t been win game  whatev lineup we ve been put out there  they re give what they have  so that s the no    thing  <BRK>as for jame  these are his first truli inconsequenti game sinc his rooki season with the cleveland cavali  who finish well out of playoff content  but even then  he could use the end of the season as an opportun to hone his abil and gain experi for futur endeavor   such as eight consecut trip to the n b a  final <BRK>so it is a credit to jame  even as the greas fire of his first season with the laker smolder  that he is out there   tri  against the king  he finish with his  st career tripl doubl    point    assist    rebound  how doe he sustain the motiv <BRK> if he s out there on the court  he s go to give what he has   walton said   that s probabl a better question for him  but i m get to know him  and that s the type of person he is  he respect and love the game  so if he s go to play  he s go to give what he has  <BRK>jame said he appreci the fan who continu to show up  he also said he owe it to himself to play with genuin effort <BRK> i ve alway respect the basketbal god   jame said   and if i m on the floor  i got to tri to play as hard as i can or do someth to affect the game and not cheat the game  <BRK>still  time have chang for the laker  who have not been to the playoff sinc    befor that  they routin fixat on the western confer stand and the number of win they would need to make the playoff  now  the most import number in their univers is   percent   as in  their odd of win the n b a  draft lotteri <BRK>then again  the laker are not the onli team that has so littl at stake at this stage of the season  look no further than the king  whose push for a playoff berth has deterior in recent week  befor sunday s game  coach dave joerger held a brief news confer  no one had much to ask <BRK> i can give you some more stuff   he said   i mean  it s sunni out  it s spring  it smell
