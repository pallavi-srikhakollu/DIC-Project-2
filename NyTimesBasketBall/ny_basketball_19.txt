 <BRK>  <BRK> on pro basketball <BRK> by scott cacciola <BRK> los angeles   to celebrate their first home win in   day  the lakers on sunday dropped streamer that had been collecting dust from the ceiling at staple center  the final lineup of the night included alex caruso  a   year old guard who spent most of the season in the n b a  s developmental g league  <BRK> caruso know thing were not supposed to be this way  his mere presence   in a crunchtime situation  no le   wa a vivid sign that the season had gone sideways for the lakers  who will be watching the playoff from various vacation destination  <BRK> caruso also know that the lakers are playing fairly meaningless game  including sunday s     victory over the sacramento king  the lakers       have nine more of these to go  starting tuesday against the wahington wizard  the buzz of lebron james s first seaon a a laker is gone  the roster will be overhauled again this summer a the franchise  which ha not been to the playoff since    rummage for solution  <BRK>  but for me   caruso said   these game are really meaningful   <BRK> the lakers are searching for motivation wherever they can find it  especially a they head toward an off seaon of uncertainty  coach luke walton s job status is tenuous at best  and   player on the current roster do not have guaranteed deal for next seaon  some of them  like caruso  are trying to showcae their skill in hope of acquiring n b a  work next seaon  <BRK>  i think this little stretch ha been really good   caruso said   because it s finally allowed me to put all that work i ve put in over the lat two year and show how much i ve evolved a a player  that i m gaining confidence and making stride to get better and better   in   appearance for the lakers this seaon  caruso ha shot     percent from the field  averaging   point and     rebound  <BRK> even player who figure to be a part of the franchise s future are focusing on personal growth  a team is always a collection of individual  but the lakers  late season emphasis on  me  is particularly understandable  <BRK>  i need to use these game to develop myself and play with the ball more   the second year forward kyle kuzma said recently  <BRK> the lakers were not yet mathematically eliminated from playoff contention when they lost to the knicks at madison square garden on march     that would happen five day later   but kuzma stood his locker in a red leather jumpsuit after the game and spoke about the immediate future  <BRK>  i m just trying to use these last      game   whatever we have   to just try to develop good habit   he said   season s pretty much over  so that s the only thing i can really do  everyone know i m a good scorer and i can do that  i m just trying to complete my game   <BRK> then there are the injured player who have largely disappeared from view  lonzo ball  brandon ingram  josh hart  for them  the end of this season is about rehabbing for the next one  <BRK> after all the loss  injury and general dysfunction  walton continues to preach the importance of team play  same a ever  <BRK>  it start with our effort and how we play and how we compete   he said   and our guy have been doing a nice job of that  even though we haven t been winning game  whatever lineup we ve been putting out there  they re giving what they have  so that s the no    thing   <BRK> a for james  these are his first truly inconsequential game since his rookie seaon with the cleveland cavalier  who finished well out of playoff contention  but even then  he could use the end of the seaon a an opportunity to hone his ability and gain experience for future endeavor   such a eight consecutive trip to the n b a  final  <BRK> so it is a credit to james  even a the greae fire of his first seaon with the lakers smolder  that he is out there   trying  against the king  he finished with his  st career triple double    point    asists    rebound  how doe he sustain the motivation  <BRK>  if he s out there on the court  he s going to give what he ha   walton said   that s probably a better question for him  but i m getting to know him  and that s the type of person he is  he respect and love the game  so if he s going to play  he s going to give what he ha   <BRK> james said he appreciated the fan who continued to show up  he also said he owed it to himself to play with genuine effort  <BRK>  i ve always respected the baketball god   james said   and if i m on the floor  i got to try to play a hard a i can or do something to affect the game and not cheat the game   <BRK> still  time have changed for the lakers  who have not been to the playoff since    before that  they routinely fixated on the western conference standing and the number of win they would need to make the playoff  now  the most important number in their universe is   percent   a in  their odds of winning the n b a  draft lottery  <BRK> then again  the lakers are not the only team that ha so little at stake at this stage of the season  look no further than the king  whose push for a playoff berth ha deteriorated in recent week  before sunday s game  coach dave joerger held a brief news conference  no one had much to ask  <BRK>  i can give you some more stuff   he said   i mean  it s sunny out  it s spring  it smell like march madness  lent and the n b a  playoff  get the seedings  get it done  exciting time   <BRK> he paused again  <BRK>  nothing else   he asked  <BRK> nothing else  <BRK>  <BRK>
