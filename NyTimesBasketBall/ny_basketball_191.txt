 <BRK>  <BRK> by the associated press <BRK> minneapolis   the plain of west texas are a long way from the bustling piazza and portico of northern italy  where davide moretti wa raised in a soccer culture and basketball wa just a niche  <BRK> but nba fan in italy can now look to the like of danilo gallinari and his   point scoring average for the los angeles clipper in a league that ha made major stride in europe since moretti wa born in bologna   year ago  <BRK> the college game  however  ha been a decidedly foreign concept overseas  though  with the term march madness likely to elicit strange look even if correctly translated  <BRK> well  there s hardly been an ncaa championship with more of a global presence than this one  with moretti s texas tech red raider facing the virginia cavalier in the title game monday night  eight player are from other country  <BRK> moretti  the sophomore starting guard for texas tech   once played on an italian junior national team with virginia forward francesco badocchi  who ha redshirted his first season  <BRK>  we re the first italian guy who have ever made it to the final four   moretti said   so it s kind of a big time thing right now back in italy for basketball   <BRK> according to data calculated digital content producer hero sport  of the     player in this year s ncaa tournament    listed a home country other than the united state  canada     contributed the most  followed australia      seventeen other country produced at least two player  including seven from african nation  <BRK> for an american kid  a shooting session in the driveway after dinner could naturally include a singing of  one shining moment  and an idyllic vision of cutting down the net at the national championship game  not so much in other country  where the presence of soccer and the significant time zone difference have long been more than enough to keep college basketball in the dark  <BRK>  when the game are on  it s usually when we re at school and stuff like that so we don t get to watch it because we re doing other thing   said kody stattmann  another virginia redshirt and a native of australia  <BRK> starting forward mamadi diakite  whose buzzer beating shot sent the cavalier to overtime in the elite eight where they outlasted purdue  ha become a national hero in guinea  in africa  though  his family and friend have to settle for watching replay  <BRK>  the day after the game  i get text about it   diakite said  <BRK> for many of these international player  then  the desire to drape a gold  silver or bronze medal around their neck can be a bigger goal than winning an ncaa title with their college team  a exhilarating a that can be  <BRK>  playing in an olympics is something that everybody dream of   said moretti  who will try to make the italian national team for the fiba world cup this summer  <BRK> moretti played on junior team in european and world championship  burnishing his credential a one of the top international prospect before choosing texa tech over indiana  connecticut and utah  <BRK> badocchi moved to the u s  earlier to further develop his game in high school in kansa  his mother s home state  her work in the fashion industry brought her to milan  where she met badocchi s father  <BRK>  since my family wa from kansa  i knew about ku  but i didn t really watch march madness or anything like that   badocchi said   even coming to virginia  i knew it wa a very good school  but i didn t really know anything about the acc or anything   <BRK> the acc is quite the challenge  of course  and the cavalier have recently cracked the conference elite with duke and north carolina under coach tony bennett  perhaps one of the way they ll be able to stay there for the long term is with these international pipeline that have not only opened with new talent source but created stronger chemistry off the court  <BRK>  you learn to appreciate and respect one another   bennett said  <BRK> also playing for the cavalier is fifth year senior center jack salt of new zealand  another redshirt  center francisco caffaro  is from argentina  freshman guard kihei clark is from california but ha a filipino mother  diakite  a fourth year junior  recalled having to use his smartphone to translate word in some of his earlier conversation with teammate  <BRK>  at first  i think it s very hard if i were from here to accept someone to take someone from somewhere else that doesn t speak my language  i d have to buy in a lot of time to talk to them   diakite said   but for them  being able to take their time and talk to me so i could be on the same layer a them is tremendous  everyone ha done such a good job of taking me in the circle   <BRK> texas tech will add two more international big men to the roster next season  russel tchewa from cameroon and andrei savrasov of russia  in addition to moretti  there s fifth year senior guard brandone francis  dominican republic  and freshman forward josh mballa  france   <BRK>  we try to be a family for these guy because they come here far away from home  that s what i did for the other guy who did to me  which wa such a great thing for me because i felt like i wan t alone   moretti said  <BRK> yes  it s hard not to find a friend in west texas  <BRK>  everything is bigger  everything is wider   moretti said   it s just a different culture  i like it  it s my home  the people are so nice  i live in the gym basically  but when i step out of the gym the people are so nice   <BRK> ___ <BRK>  <BRK>
