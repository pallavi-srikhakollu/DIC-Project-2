<BRK><BRK>by marc stein<BRK>at the end of a dizzying frenzy of trade in the n b a   featuring   deal in one week  anthony davis of the new orleans pelican stayed put   for now <BRK>yet there wa plenty of action to make up for the lack of a davis trade  with two of the four title hopeful in the eastern conference making significant acquisition before thursday afternoon s trade deadline  intensifying the race at the top of the east after philadelphia s big trade earlier this week <BRK>in the most significant deadline day deal  toronto acquired the former all star center marc gaol from memphis  while milwaukee imported the sharpshooting forward nikola mirotic from new orleans a part of a three team deal that also involved detroit <BRK>those move capped a wild seven day stretch that began with the knicks  blockbuster trade of kristaps porzingis to dalla and also included the  er  acquisition of tobia harris from the los angeles clipper  philadelphia s big swing to land harris  who joined a starting lineup that already featured joel embiid  ben simmons  jimmy butler and jj redick  seemingly forced the raptor and buck  who entered thursday a the eat s second  and first place team  to make their own move <BRK>milwaukee  toronto and philadelphia  along with the boston celtic  are jockeying to become the first lebron james le team to represent the east in the n b a  final since   <BRK>the sixer  at fifth in the conference standing  didn t stop at their harris trade  though  shortly before the deadline  they made a surprising deal with the orlando magic to send the wayward guard markelle fultz   whom they selected with the no    overall pick in the   draft   for the small forward jonathon simmons and two future draft pick  one in the first round  one in the second  <BRK>the celtic  who entered thursday in third  came away from trade season simply relieved that davis had not been traded to the los angeles lakers  after a nervy two week  during which the celtic could merely watch because of an obscure league rule  they will now get an opportunity to make a run at davis in the off season   although davis is said to remain adamantly against signing a long term contract with the celtic should they trade for him <BRK>the celtic were ineligible to make in season trade offer for davis with kyrie irving still on their roster  since both davis and irving are currently playing under maximum rookie scale contract extension  league rule allow team to field only one such player <BRK>the lakers  however  were unable to persuade the pelican to surrender davis during the exclusive negotiating window they had to pursue him in the wake of davis s jan    request to be traded  the front office of los angeles and new orleans had no discussion about davis on deadline day  according to two people familiar with the talk  after negotiation broke down tuesday over what the lakers deemed to be exorbitant demand from new orleans <BRK>late thursday  pelican general manager dell demps confirmed that davis would continue playing for the team rather than be held out to guard against serious injury in advance of the trade sweepstakes that will likely emerge closer to the draft  davis had not played since jan    because of a finger injury followed the team not wanting to risk an injury  demps confirmed he would be back on the court soon <BRK> ultimately  anthony made it clear to u he want to play and he give our team the best opportunity to win game   demps said in a statement <BRK>the lakers on thursday were left trying to recover from the instability wrought their pursuit of davis a they seek to make the playoff in james s first seaon in los angeles  they entered thursday s play at      good for just  th place in the west  after falling to a humiliating   point defeat in indiana on tuesday night  the one sided loss  against the victor oladipo le pacer  left little doubt that the mounting trade speculation surrounding the like of lonzo ball  brandon ingram and kyle kuzma wa taking a toll on the lakers <BRK>when the lakers couldn t acquire davis on thursday  they did trade the croatian center ivica zubac   who wa among the promising young player mentioned a potential part of a trade for davis   along with michael bealey to the los angeles clipper in a deal for forward mike muscala  the move opened a roster spot for the lakers that will allow them to seriously consider signing the former all star forward carmelo anthony  but los angeles will have plenty of other option on the free agent market a various veteran become available following the deadline <BRK>a the davis talk cooled on thursday  much of the focus leading into the deadline centered on the grizzly  who wound up trading gaol but keeping their point guard mike conley  who had drawn serious trade interest from the utah jazz and detroit piston <BRK>conley     ha two season  with a combined salary of    million  left on his contract after this one  which convinced the grizzly that trading him closer to the draft in june might yield a better offer  gasol  though  can become a free agent at season s end  so memphis had to trade him now or risk losing one of the game s best two way player without compensation this summer <BRK>charlotte and memphis engaged in serious trade talk regarding gasol earlier this week  which prompted the spaniard  who ha only played for the grizzly   and who played his high school ball in memphis after the grizzly imported his brother pau gasol from spain   to clean out his locker <BRK>but toronto  perhaps motivated what the sixer did and the buck  move for mirotic  packaged jonas valanciunas  delon wright  c j  mile and a second round draft pick in   to add gasol to a team straining to convince the all star forward kawhi leonard to make a long term commitment when he becomes a free agent july   <BRK>the buck  like toronto  managed to upgrade their roster without surrendering a first round pick  by expanding a thon maker for stanley johnson trade it had hashed out earlier this week into a three team deal  milwaukee landed mirotic for the primary cost of four second round draft pick  which were sent to the pelican  who also came away with johnson and the veteran jason smith <BRK>the knicks did not make another deal  one week removed from the porzingis blockbuster that got the trade madness started  but they did set two veteran free to find deal on the postseaon market  the outspoken forward ene kanter wa waived  a wa the newly acquired wes matthew   with matthew immediately coming to term with indiana to join the pacer after he clear waiver <BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK>
