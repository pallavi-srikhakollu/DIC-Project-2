 <BRK>  <BRK> on college basketball <BRK> by marc tracy <BRK> when zion williamson of duke went down with a severed shoe and a sprained knee   second into wednesday night s showdown with north carolina  it wa bad news for plenty involved  williamson now ha to deal with an injury  duke had to play it archrival without it best player and duly lost       nike faced question about it product s apparent failure  <BRK> but espn  broadcating the contest a part of it multibillion dollar deal with the atlantic coat conference  did just fine  the game s biggest star wa injured for nearly   percent of the game  yet on thursday  the network reported that the rivalry had produced it highest ever rating for a weeknight college baketball game  <BRK> the episode crystallized the economic limitation that n c a a  amateurism and n b a  rule impose on williamson  a preternatural talent  and the unique way that they limit the income of a unique player  <BRK> if the n b a  did not bar high schoolers from heading straight to the league   a rule that may disappear in a few year   then williamson could already have been playing for  say  the atlanta hawk and making several million dollar on his rookie contract  if n c a a  rule did not prevent player from signing endorsement  williamson could already have been receiving million from nike  <BRK> however  barring an outright catastrophe  williamson  the likely top draft pick  will be getting paid  soon and well  and at a time when his economic productivity is even higher than it is today  his specialness  though  obscures what some suggest is the greatest injustice of college sport  policy of amateurism  <BRK> in contrast to williamson and a few other superstar  most player in college basketball are denied the right to cash in during what is very likely their moment of peak economic value  <BRK>  the top guy are worth a lot   on the order of million a year   said daniel rascher  a sport economist who ha studied the economic value of college athlete   but the seven  eight  nine guy   he added  referring to the player further down the depth chart   are going to be several hundred thousand a year in term of the incremental revenue they bring to the school   <BRK> take duke s jordan goldwire  he wa a midrated recruit out of high school  and his option besides duke included midmajor program such a eatern kentucky  coatal carolina and nevada la vega  he is probably not bound for n b a  rich  this seaon  he ha not played at all in three a c c  game and ha averaged fewer than seven minute in those he ha played in  he played eight minute against the tar heel on wednesday  but that actually made him an essential contributor to a two hour broadcat worth a lot of money to duke  the a c c  and espn  <BRK>  if you look at the n b a   the guy who don t play very much still get paid a lot   rascher said  <BRK> or forget about duke and think of the player at whichever team make the n c a a  tournament out of the big south or the patriot league  part of that billion dollar event s charm come from the quirky matchup   and the potential for exciting upset   when such team face juggernaut like duke and kansa in the early round  player on those team  too  are producing a real financial return for the n c a a   for it member college and for cbs and turner sport  even though their ability will never be remotely so lucrative again  yet they are prohibited from taking more than a relatively small  prescribed share of that value  <BRK> moreover  all of these player  too  are risking future in professional baketball   more of them than you might think  while fewer than   percent of division i men s baketball player are drafted into the n b a   the n c a a  said lat year  around half go on to play pro baketball in some form  such a in foreign league  from team in the five top conference  the n c a a  added  more than three quarter of player go on to be paid to play  <BRK> the college sport establishment s common rebuttal to these line of thinking is that not paying the player beyond scholarship and related cost is actually crucial to the popularity of their sport  <BRK> last year  in a federal lawsuit challenging the n c a a  s restriction on compensation from an antitrust perspective  mike aresco  a former sport television executive who is now commissioner of the american athletic conference  testified that college player  amateur status wa a feature of their sport  appeal  not a bug  <BRK>  it resonated with fan because it wan t professionalized at all   he said  according to a court transcript  while serving a a witness for several conference and the n c a a  itself   and it wa presented and framed a college student  a college sport   <BRK> among other thing  this distinction differentiated college basketball and college football from minor league sport  aresco said   and that wa very important   he added   because minor league had never been popular   <BRK> he said   people view college sport separately  and we always maintained that separation   <BRK> rascher wa a witness for the plaintiff in that case  in which a decision is expected any day  his reply to argument like aresco s wa to point to the experiment of sort that took place a few year ago  when the n c a a  permitted college to offer athlete fund that included the so called full cost of attendance  after player began to be  paid  slightly more than they had previously been  college sport  popularity wa not measurably affected  <BRK> williamson s injury in the marquee game of the regular seaon  particularly so early in the contest  appeared to be a devatating blow to duke  which entered a a   point favorite yet never led once  being magnanimous  roy williams  north carolina s colorful coach  acknowledged a much afterward  <BRK>  be honest   he said   when the big fella go out of the game  it change a lot of stuff for them   <BRK> judging from the final score  williams wa right  but be honest  if you looked only at the bottom line  you would not even know that the big fella wa gone  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
