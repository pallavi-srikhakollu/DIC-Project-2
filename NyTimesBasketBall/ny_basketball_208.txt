atkinson said  <BRK> not in april  <BRK> russell  levert and spencer dinwiddie gave the sixer fit off the dribble  buried open look from   point range    of    and smoked a sixer team that resembled one straight out of the early process era  <BRK> russell got the first win of his playoff career and the last laugh  scoring   point in the third quarter and leading the net to one of the biggest win since they moved to brooklyn  it came day after los angeles lakers executive magic johnson  who dumped russell on the net  resigned  russell  who scored   point in the second half  can safely scroll through his phone to see his net are trending  <BRK> the  er might want to keep their phone on lock  <BRK> sixer benchwarmer amir johnson wa caught tv camera sitting on the bench and scrolling through his phone late in the fourth quarter and the sixer down big  johnson showed all star joel embiid whatever message wa on the phone and then slid it into his warmup pant pocket  <BRK> embiid said johnson received an update on a sick daughter  sixer coach brett brown called johnson s action  completely unacceptable   <BRK> so wa philadelphia s performance  <BRK> jimmy butler scored   point and saved the sixer  widely considered a favorite to at least reach the east semi  from losing    embiid slogged his way through   forgettable minute on his bum left knee  simmons wa a postseason dud against russell  his high school teammate  <BRK> the sixth seeded net turned philly in the city of     boo   and that s just counting the one echoing throughout the well fargo center   a they phoned in one of their worst effort of the seaon  <BRK> sixer starter simmons  tobias harris and jj redick combined to shoot   of   from the floor for   point  the sixer missed   of     pointer  <BRK>  we all got to do a better job  u  the fan  we have to bring the fun   embiid said  <BRK> poised for a postseaon breakthrough  russell flourished and hit a string of jumper in the third that never let the sixer seriously chip away at the lead  levert s third   in the fourth made it a   point game and there wa no looking back   at leat not for russell a he raised his arm in celebration a he headed down the tunnel into brooklyn s locker room  <BRK>  i trut our offense  we got great mind behind it   rusell said   coach set u up earlier this season with a routine and recipe for the offense and it s been flowing ever since   <BRK> embiid wa introduced to a roaring standing ovation and heard chant of  mvp   and  trust the process  when he opened the game with two free throw  <BRK> but he just wan t ready to play at an all star level for any serious length of time  he wa hit with a technical when he shoved jared dudley to the ground and went back to the locker room for more treatment with about   minute left in the first half  he scored   point   including   free throw   and had   rebound  <BRK> butler kept the sixer in the game with a sensational first half that showed why the franchise surrendered so much to land the four time all star  he buried a   at the horn to send the sixer into the break down      he wa   of   and scored   point while the rest of the sixer shot   of   for   point  <BRK> embiid ha always fancied himself a   point shooter  and with tendinitis in his left knee that cost him most of the final month of the season rendering him immobile  he decided to camp out a bit more beyond the arc  he missed all five  s in the half   and the sixer missed their first    <BRK>  i thought that joel looked like he hadn t played for a while yet wa still dominant   brown said  <BRK> with or without a healthy embiid  the net were about unstoppable for much of the half with the sixer clearly not ready to play  dinwiddie and demarre carroll hit consecutive  s during a     run  levert hit two straight  s for a   point lead and the sixer   who had been the darling of the city during the process   were soundly booed off the court     fan ticked off at a supposed east contender  <BRK> tip in <BRK> net  c jarrett allen wa whistled for foul on philadelphia s first two possession  <BRK>  er  butler and tobias harris are both eligible for free agency and could stick around after they were acquired in mid season trade  team owner josh harris said both player could be re signed   it s really hard to get good player of their caliber  now that we ve attracted them into our system  we re going to work really hard at keeping them around for a while   harris said  <BRK> vote of confidence  <BRK> harris said brown wa a  great coach  but offered no assurance he would return to the bench for another season if the sixer failed to make a deep run in the playoff  <BRK>  we think he s the right leader to take u where we need to go in the playoff   harris said   i
