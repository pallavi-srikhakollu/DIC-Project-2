<BRK><BRK>on pro basketball<BRK>by scott cacciola<BRK>los angeles   on thursday morning  in the middle of a six game road trip that had produced it share of dud  knicks coach david fizdale started practice gathering his player for an announcement  kevin knox  a first year forward  had been named the n b a  s eastern conference rookie of the month for december <BRK>the news wa well received knox s teammate  emmanuel mudiay and mario hezonja rubbed knox s head a frank ntilikina made a halfhearted attempt to jump on his back  knox appeared genuinely surprised   and pleaed  the award seemed to validate his hard work while offering the knicks       a reprieve from a seaon that wa long ago sacrificed to the twin god of player development and the draft lottery <BRK>such sacrifice  of course  have become a franchise specialty <BRK> i still have a lot of work to do   knox said <BRK>and so do the knicks  who arrived to face the los angeles lakers       at staple center on friday night having lost eight straight <BRK>but then  another flicker of joy  the knicks left with a     victory that they described a cathartic  even if the lakers were without lebron james  kyle kuzma and rajon rondo  all sidelined with injury <BRK>at this point  the knicks care little for such technicality  james l  dolan  the team owner  wa in town for the game and visited the locker room afterward to congratulate the team <BRK> when we win  we celebrate like it s the super bowl   fizdale said   why not  <BRK>the knicks were right to savor the win  who know when the next one will come  they still need to visit the portland trail blazer and the golden state warrior before returning to new york on friday  and one game will neither change the trajectory of their season nor mask their daily challenge <BRK>but it wa important in it own way <BRK> we ll try to run with the momentum   tim hardaway jr  said <BRK>the knicks have an odd roster made up of veteran on expiring contract and inexperienced player who are still learning the business of pro basketball  and that mix  which is almost a     split  ha caused some problem  fizdale said  not among player in the locker room    they like each other   he said   but in term of the team s on court chemistry <BRK>before the knicks arrived in los angeles  the first half of their road trip featured a   point loss to the milwaukee buck  a   point loss to the utah jazz and a   point loss to the denver nugget <BRK> we are so young and we have so many guy in contract year fighting for their life that i ve got to get this group to move the ball   fizdale said   the number say that when we pas the ball  we win  and when we don t pas  we lose  <BRK>he went on to acknowledge the inevitable  friction  between player who are vying for their next deal  and may feel more urgency to produce  and those who have the luxury of being included in the team s long term plan  for the most part  fizdale ha been favoring the young player with promise <BRK> that s just part of this league  and that s the juggling act that i have to handle   fizdale said   am i always going to be right  no  but will i always be upfront and honest about where we are and what we re doing  yes  <BRK>ene kanter  one of the aforementioned veteran who will be a free agent this summer  ha gone public with his displeasure over his diminished role  kanter got an opportunity off the bench against the lakers and delivered  finishing with   point and   rebound <BRK> i don t want no free money   kanter said   this organization pay me money to go out and play a hard a i can and just fight  so i m going to give my everything  <BRK>kanter  though  is not the only one to voice frustration  hardaway  who figure to be a part of the team s future  ha alluded to the toll of losing  to the thankless process of a perpetual rebuild  he doe not subscribe to the idea that the knicks should be tanking game to increase their odds of getting the top pick in the draft lottery <BRK> i m a competitor   hardaway said   none of u got here losing ballgame for our respective ball club when we were in college or in high school  everybody wa winner  everybody wanted to win  jut to be in this situation is tough  but it build character  <BRK>one of the bright spot ha been the improved play of knox  who averaged     point and   rebound while shooting     percent from   point range during december <BRK>against the lakers  knox made back to back   pointer early in the first quarter  then sliced through the lane for a dunk and a   point lead  the game wa barely six minute old  james  in a dark blazer  watched with a dour expression from behind the home bench   he is expected to miss at least another week because of a groin injury   the knicks  after giving up their lead  held on late  thanks to some solid defense <BRK>knox finished with   point in   minute  which is the sort of workload to which he is becoming accustomed <BRK> we talked about building him into a premier n b a  player who can play both end of the floor   fizdale said   and we re trying to give him a taste of what that entail  it s not necessarily the minute you play  but what you re doing with those minute from an effort standpoint  from a competitive standpoint  how many calorie are you burning  <BRK>for one night  the burn wa worth it  the knicks can only hope it is a sign of thing to come <BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK>
