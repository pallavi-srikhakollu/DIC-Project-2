 <BRK>  <BRK> on pro basketball <BRK> by scott cacciola <BRK> los angeles   the evolution of giannis antetokounmpo into a global star ha been playing out for six season  it manifest in soaring dunk  or blocked shot from the weak side that defy logic  or wraparound pass to an open shooter  or crossover dribble that leave defender reeling in his impossibly long limbed wake  <BRK> but pat connaughton  a reserve guard  did not have the opportunity to witness antetokounmpo s feat on a daily basis until last summer  when he signed with the milwaukee buck and joined his new teammate for scrimmage ahead of training camp  <BRK>  you d see him do something ridiculous  and i d be looking around and nobody would be reacting   connaughton recalled   like   did you guy not just see that    <BRK> for the player who have been around antetokounmpo the longest  there may be an element of genius fatigue at work   not that they take him for granted  malcolm brogdon  a third year guard  tried to provide some context for connaughton at one of those early scrimmage  <BRK>  you ll get used to it after a while   brogdon told him   it happens all the time   <BRK> antetokounmpo     ha turned the sublime into the routine  but the novelty ha not worn off for n b a  fan  who have made him appointment viewing this season  and the buck have shaped themselves into contender following his lead  on top of that  nearly two year after kobe bryant  the retired los angeles lakers guard  challenged antetokounmpo to win the league s most valuable player award  he may be on the verge of upending the eastern conference to do so  <BRK>  everything you see about him or hear about him is how hard he work   lakers coach luke walton said   and how great he want to be   <BRK> the buck improved their league best record to     after coming from behind to defeat the lakers on friday night at staple center  antetokounmpo  who ha been dealing with right knee soreness  finished with   point and   rebound in the buck      win  which qualified a a quiet effort for him  but he had his moment  <BRK> early in the fourth quarter  he sized up mike muscala  his   foot   defender  at the top of the perimeter  he took a couple of hard dribble into the paint  threw his right shoulder into muscala to knock him off balance  then dunked over him with his left hand  <BRK>  he draw so much attention   buck coach mike budenholzer said  <BRK> it wa a play that helped ignite the buck  who enjoyed an eventful day  after point guard eric bledsoe agreed to a four year     million contract extension in the afternoon  he roasted the lakers for a season high   point  in addition  pau gasol wa expected to join the team after securing a buyout from the san antonio spur  <BRK>  unbelievable guy   antetokounmpo said of gasol   he s been to the final  he ha so much experience  i think he s definitely going to help u   <BRK> the buck are readying for a playoff run with antetokounmpo a their focal point  entering their game against the utah jazz on saturday night  antetokounmpo wa averaging     point      rebound and     asists while shooting     percent from the field  <BRK>  when the season started  we knew we had something special   we had a great team   he said   but to be honest with you  no  i never thought we were going to have the best record in the n b a  <BRK>  but i think we ve worked hard for it  we go out there and show up for every game  and we try to win every game   <BRK> there is no apt historical comparison for antetokounmpo because the league ha never seen anyone quite like him  he is too long and too strong  too quick and too skilled  a   foot   power forward who can defend point guard at one end and post up the league s stoutest center at the other  a for antetokounmpo s unique athleticism  connaughton considers him to be something of a hybrid of kevin durant of the golden state warrior and lebron james of the lakers  <BRK>  he s got the length of k d    connaughton said   but now he s at the point where he s got the strength of lebron   or at least he s on that trajectory  and that speaks volume about his work ethic and his desire to be the best that he can be  because not a lot of guy with that talent work that hard   <BRK> connaughton  whose playing time ha fluctuated this seaon  often go to the team s practice facility on off day for extra shooting and conditioning work  antetokounmpo  connaughton said  is always there  too  he is a gym rat in the second year of a four year     million contract  connaughton joined the buck after three seaon with the portland trail blazer  and he said antetokounmpo play with the same motor   the same mind set   a damian lillard  the blazer  all star point guard  <BRK>  obviously dame is a different player  but i think they share an inner desire   connaughton said   it ha nothing to do with the outside  it ha nothing to do with the medium  the attention or the press  like  they re in it for their own reason   the right reason  in my opinion   <BRK> whenever budenholzer is aked about it  which is often these day  he make a compelling cae for antetokounmpo a the n b a  s most valuable player   and he cite his defense a exhibit a  antetokounmpo is so dynamic on offense  budenholzer said  that it tends to overshadow everything else is doe  sure enough  he had three blocked shot against the lakers  <BRK> antetokounmpo is not going to create headline with bold prediction   after friday s win  he repeated familiar mantra about taking it  day day  and continuing to  work hard    but the buck must be thinking big  all around them  powerhouse team are struggling  even the warrior  the two time defending champion  have had issue  <BRK> few thought the buck would be this good this quickly  but everyone wa saying the same thing about antetokounmpo when he entered the league at age    suddenly  the future is now  <BRK>  <BRK>
