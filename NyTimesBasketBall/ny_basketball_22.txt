the weak side that defi logic  or wraparound pass to an open shooter  or crossov dribbl that leav defend reel in his imposs long limb wake <BRK>but pat connaughton  a reserv guard  did not have the opportun to wit antetokounmpo s feat on a daili basi until last summer  when he sign with the milwauke buck and join his new teammat for scrimmag ahead of train camp <BRK> you d see him do someth ridicul  and i d be look around and nobodi would be react   connaughton recal   like   did you guy not just see that   <BRK>for the player who have been around antetokounmpo the longest  there may be an element of genius fatigu at work   not that they take him for grant  malcolm brogdon  a third year guard  tri to provid some context for connaughton at one of those earli scrimmag <BRK> you ll get use to it after a while   brogdon told him   it happen all the time  <BRK>antetokounmpo     has turn the sublim into the routin  but the novelti has not worn off for n b a  fan  who have made him appoint view this season  and the buck have shape themselv into contend follow his lead  on top of that  near two year after kobe bryant  the retir los angel laker guard  challeng antetokounmpo to win the leagu s most valuabl player award  he may be on the verg of upend the eastern confer to do so <BRK> everyth you see about him or hear about him is how hard he work   laker coach luke walton said   and how great he want to be  <BRK>the buck improv their leagu best record to     after come from behind to defeat the laker on friday night at stapl center  antetokounmpo  who has been deal with right knee sore  finish with   point and   rebound in the buck      win  which qualifi as a quiet effort for him  but he had his moment <BRK>earli in the fourth quarter  he size up mike muscala  his   foot   defend  at the top of the perimet  he took a coupl of hard dribbl into the paint  threw his right shoulder into muscala to knock him off balanc  then dunk over him with his left hand <BRK> he draw so much attent   buck coach mike budenholz said <BRK>it was a play that help ignit the buck  who enjoy an event day  after point guard eric bledso agre to a four year     million contract extens in the afternoon  he roast the laker for a season high   point  in addit  pau gasol was expect to join the team after secur a buyout from the san antonio spur <BRK> unbeliev guy   antetokounmpo said of gasol   he s been to the final  he has so much experi  i think he s definit go to help us  <BRK>the buck are readi for a playoff run with antetokounmpo as their focal point  enter their game against the utah jazz on saturday night  antetokounmpo was averag     point      rebound and     assist while shoot     percent from the field <BRK> when the season start  we knew we had someth special   we had a great team   he said   but to be honest with you  no  i never thought we were go to have the best record in the n b a <BRK> but i think we ve work hard for it  we go out there and show up for everi game  and we tri to win everi game  <BRK>there is no apt histor comparison for antetokounmpo becaus the leagu has never seen anyon quit like him  he is too long and too strong  too quick and too skill  a   foot   power forward who can defend point guard at one end and post up the leagu s stoutest center at the other  as for antetokounmpo s uniqu athletic  connaughton consid him to be someth of a hybrid of kevin durant of the golden state warrior and lebron jame of the laker <BRK> he s got the length of k d    connaughton said   but now he s at the point where he s got the strength of lebron   or at least he s on that trajectori  and that speak volum about his work ethic and his desir to be the best that he can be  becaus not a lot of guy with that talent work that hard  <BRK>connaughton  whose play time has fluctuat this season  often goe to the team s practic facil on off day for extra shoot and condit work  antetokounmpo  connaughton said  is alway there  too  he is a gym rat in the second year of a four year     million contract  connaughton join the buck after three season with the portland trail blazer  and he said antetokounmpo play with the same motor   the same mind set   as damian lillard  the blazer  all star point guard <BRK> obvious dame is a differ player  but i think they share an inner desir   connaughton said   it has noth to do with the outsid  it has noth to do with the media  the attent or the press  like  they re in it for their own reason   the right reason  in my opinion  <BRK>whenev budenholz is ask about it  which is often these day  he make a compel case for antetokounmpo as the n b a  s most valuabl player   and he cite his defens as exhibit a  antetokounmpo is so dynam on offens  budenholz said  that it tend to overshadow everyth els is doe  sure enough  he had three block shot against the laker <BRK>antetokounmpo is not go to creat headlin with bold predict   after friday s win  he repeat familiar mantra about take it  day day  and continu to  work hard    but the buck must be think big  all around them  powerhous team are struggl  even the warrior  the two time defend champion  have had issu <BRK>few thought the buck would be this good this quick  but everyon was say the same thing about antetokounmpo when he enter the leagu at age    sudden  the futur is now <BRK><BRK>
