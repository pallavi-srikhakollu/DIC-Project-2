the miami heat     on wednesday night to finish     and clinch the no    seed in the eastern conference  <BRK> with close friend lebron james  chris paul and carmelo anthony leading the cheer from their courtside seat  wade had his fifth career triple double in three quarter  he fittingly secured it with a pas to udonis haslem  his teammate of   year who play sparingly now and made his only start of the season  <BRK>  i wa like  i don t know why  but everybody feel like now you ve got to go out and score   in your last game because kobe did it   said wade  wearing a sparkling gold jacket and gold sneaker   so hopefully i took the bar all the way back down and say let s go get a triple double  that s easier   <BRK> a night after scoring   point in his final game in miami  wade showed one more time that he s walking away with his skill intact  <BRK> he played   minute  dribbling out the shot clock the final time he had the ball before checking out with   second remaining  then it wa time for a lengthy postgame celebration on the court with teammate and friend  <BRK>  the man went out with a triple double  don t let that go unnoticed  he had a triple double   all star d angelo rusell said   he is a guy that paved the way for a lot of u  he s been with that franchise for that long period of time  he s mr  miami   <BRK> russell had   point on seven   pointer for the net  who will face the third seeded philadelphia  er beginning this weekend in their first postseason appearance since    one that seemed unlikely when they were     in december  but they went     from there for their first winning record since going     in       when they were knocked out wade s heat in the second round  <BRK>  special night   net coach kenny atkinson said   pretty amazing season so far   <BRK> the game mattered only to the net  who quickly ended any fear of finishing seventh and having to face the toronto raptor in the first round  <BRK> but that wa secondary to a last chance to celebrate wade  the three time nba champion who wa ending his  th and final nba season  <BRK> he wa loudly cheered from the moment he emerged alone from the tunnel for pregame layup  fan   egged on at one point paul and anthony   chanted  we want wade  we want wade   when he wa on the bench  even though the   year old guard had played a season high   minute tuesday and coach erik spoelstra warned before the game that it probably wouldn t be that way again  <BRK> but there wa no keeping wade down for long  it took him a little bit to get going  a jarrett allen added wade to the list of star whose shot he s blocked this seaon   a list that included james  <BRK>  i loved seeing cp and melo over there getting the crowd going to get dwyane back in there and dwyane come from the old school nba   spoelstra said   that wa pre load management  so we were not load managing him tonight and i wa not talking to my sport scientist whether he could go  even though i walked in and saw him on that training table an hour before the game and he did not look fit to go  at all  but he s cut from a different cloth   <BRK> the heat hoped the final game would matter  but the net and orlando magic had clinched spot over the weekend to leave only one spot left coming into the last week  miami wa eliminated from contention for it despite it victory tuesday  <BRK>  for me  i m happy with this season   wade said   unfortunately for our organization and our team  we weren t able to put ourselves in a position to win enough game to be in the playoff  but for what i wanted for this season  i m happy to say that i completed that   <BRK> tip in <BRK> heat  haslem finished with   point and   rebound      wade passed elgin baylor      point  to move into  th place on the nba s career list  he finished with      <BRK> net  starter joe harris  toe  and demarre carroll  right wrist  sat out  though atkinson said they would be ready for the playoff opener      shabazz napier scored   point off the bench  <BRK> the last jersey <BRK> wade ha been exchanging jersey with player after game this season  but there wa one missing  anthony  who helped persuade wade to return this season  didn t play long this season before parting way with houston  so wade gave his final one to him  <BRK>  i didn t get an opportunity to play against melo this year and exchange jersey with him   wade said   that
