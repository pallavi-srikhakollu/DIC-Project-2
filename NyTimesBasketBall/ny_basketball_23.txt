 <BRK>  <BRK> on college basketball <BRK> by marc tracy <BRK> minneapolis   this final four is the fifth anniversary of one of the most effective  if inadvertent  instance of athlete activism in college sport  <BRK> this wa when the connecticut star shabazz napier  speaking to the news medium shortly before the   national championship game  said that he sometimes did not have enough to eat  <BRK>  there are hungry night that i go to bed and i m starving   he said  <BRK> within week  the n c a a  s board of director for division i voted to lift restriction on how much team could feed their player  no longer would there be bizarre hairsplitting over what wa and wa not a meal  notoriously  serving peanut did not count  while serving peanut butter did   now team can and do routinely give athlete feast  <BRK> this common sense reform had been in the work and probably would have occurred eventually  but the stark comment a high profile player at the n c a a  s signature event ensured the nearly immediate change and boatload of attention on the n c a a  s power over college athlete  <BRK> it is fruitful to remember the efficacy of napier s comment  because we are at a moment when it appears that further reform to college sport  much maligned policy of amateurism will come only from within  the player will have the foremost and maybe even exclusive power to agitate for change  <BRK> what would have happened if zion williamson had said  after his nike shoe exploded  jeopardizing his career  that enough wa enough  that he no longer would wear a shoe for nothing while his coach wa at least indirectly paid million nike  and that no other player should put up with this hypocrisy  either  <BRK>  the power is with labor and the player   said kain colter  the former northwestern quarterback who led a unionization drive among his teammate several year ago  <BRK> this wa most obviously displayed in    when missouri football player threatened to sit out a game unless the university president stepped down or wa fired  he stepped down  that the boycott concerned the campus s racial climate rather than the player  compensation ought not conceal the reality of what happened  the player   unpaid  un unionized   flexed their muscle  and the system gave in  <BRK> vesting power in athlete to reform sport is not historically aberrant  from jackie robinson withstanding taunt  threat and worse to break major league baseball s color line  to baseball player striking in the  s and   s to gain and keep full fledged free agency  to the track standout edwin moses devising benefit for olympic athlete  athlete have often been the one bringing about change  their leverage is unmatched  they are the one the fan pay to see  and therefore the one who ultimately have the power over profit  <BRK> and they are the only one with a steady interest in  well  their own interest  <BRK> consider what else ha happened since napier s comment  <BRK> colter s unionization effort  which a national labor relation board regional director endorsed week before napier s final four  wa squashed the overall board  <BRK> the antitrust lawsuit that might have allowed player to profit off the use of their likeness in video game and other medium ended in an extremely limited victory for player  <BRK> lat month  a second antitrust suit  which sought to explode the n c a a  s ban on compensation  concluded at the district court level with a technical victory for player that looked a much like a victory for the establishment  a federal judge ruled that the n c a a  could continue to limit payment to player that were not directly related to education  <BRK>  the court are not a forum where you re going to get relief   said don yee  a sport lawyer and player right advocate  <BRK> for yee  who also happens to be tom brady s agent  the solution is  private entrepreneurialism   he is planning a small professional football league that would field player not yet eligible for the n f l   which generally requires player to be three year removed from high school   it would be developmental  like college football  but unlike college football  average pay would be       <BRK> a planned summer basketball league  the historical basketball league  would pay scholarship for it college level player while enabling them to sell their name  image and likeness to sponsor  the n b a  s development league plan to offer higher salary  the probable dissolution of the one and done rule in the next few year will again permit the most talented high school graduate to jump straight to the n b a  instead of having to spend at least a year in college  <BRK> a few state  notably north carolina and california  have bill floating around that would allow athlete to be paid if  say  a video game us their name and likeness  <BRK> all these effort are well intentioned  but if past is prologue  the system will not be successfully reformed in such patchwork fashion  <BRK> nor is the college sport establishment likely to change it mind of it own volition  <BRK> at a news conference in minneapolis last week  the n c a a  president  mark emmert  said that he had sought to increase athlete participation in college sport  governance  <BRK>  i m a lifelong academic   he said   i grew up with that tradition  and i never worked at a school that didn t have student on their board  and they were full voting board member  they voted on my contract  and i think that s just perfectly appropriate   <BRK> there are athlete serving on several important council  but there is not one on the n c a a  board of governor  no athlete vote on emmert s contract  which wa extended late last year through    <BRK> tim nevius  a onetime n c a a  investigator whose experience led him to turn on the system  belief the answer lie with player activism  last month  he announced a new organization  the college athlete advocacy initiative  that plan to pair his business representing athlete before the n c a a  with trying to advocate for broader reform in coordination with player  <BRK> he acknowledged in an interview the challenge  including the relatively short time span that college athlete actually are college athlete  a well a their current lack of formal bargaining power  but he insisted that player action wa the surest avenue to change  <BRK>  there are power here that the athlete have   he said   and we have to simply have them realize it and help them take the power into their own hand   <BRK> ro gold unwude  a turner sport analyst and former stanford basketball player  said last month that she expected to hear more from college athlete about how they felt about their position in the pecking order  <BRK>  that s the way our culture is  where we all are telling our story on social medium platform   she said  <BRK>  if you re really struggling or hungry   she added   that experience will come out   <BRK> apathy will come out a well  though  beyond the structural obstacle to athlete deciding the system is unfair and determining to act to change it  a player could validly decide that he is happy receiving what he currently get  <BRK> napier  who is now a reserve on the net and who through a spokesman declined to comment for this article  said more during his  hungry night  speech heard  round the world  even though it received le publicity  <BRK> he noted that there were other wrong  player  jersey were sold to fan  and the player did not receive a cut  more basically  he said  the player were not paid  <BRK> it wa  he suggested  wrong  probably  <BRK>  something can change  something should change   napier said five year ago   but if it doesn t  at the end of the day  we ve been doing this for so long   <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
