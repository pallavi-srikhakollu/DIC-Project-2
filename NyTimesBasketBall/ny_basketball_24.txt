<BRK><BRK>by howard megdal<BRK>the hiring of the w n b a  point guard kristi toliver a a full time asistant coach with the n b a  s wahington wizard while she is still an active player wa widely applauded a a notable new achievement for woman in coaching <BRK>it followed the san antonio spur  hiring of becky hammon  and other woman like nancy lieberman and jenny boucek also joining n b a  coaching staff <BRK> with anything  you need to see it to be it   said briann january  a guard for the phoenix mercury and  in her off season  an assistant woman s basketball coach at arizona state   i see it now because of becky  because of kristi  i see the opportunity that is out there to take that next step in this professional area  <BRK>for many player  the move showed n b a  team tapping into a longstanding  significant pipeline of female talent <BRK> i think a lot of woman in general are missing out on a lot of good opportunity in which we can be extremely beneficial to any team  to any organization  no matter our gender   said alana beard  a veteran los angeles spark guard often mentioned a a coaching candidate her peer <BRK>beard cited the meager pay toliver is to receive this seaon   just      because of limit in the w n b a  s collective bargaining agreement   a an  extremely important  issue for the league to address in negotiation for a new agreement  the goal would be making a barrier that ha long been permeable on one side   men into woman s baketball on the coaching side   into a free exchange of talent  regardless of gender  baed on opportunity <BRK>many  if not most  w n b a  player  who are paid significantly le than their male counterpart  cannot afford to spend their off season working for so little pay  their basketball skill are worth much more   into the million of dollar   in service of woman s league overseas <BRK> all of those thing on a coach s plate to take care of  to do that for      for an entire n b a  season is crazy   january said   i d like to break that down and do the math  like how much that is a game or how much that is a day  that would just be insult to injury  <BRK>yet some people  including commentator on internet site and men s basketball fan in real life  contend these woman should be happy to have opportunity at all <BRK>this attitude rankles many w n b a  player   that even toliver s shot  let alone chance for other woman with considerable experience playing and in many cae coaching  is often thought of a a one sided benefit for those who are hired <BRK>but in many cae  the n b a  came calling after seeing the woman excelling on their own  toliver s work with the mystic helped bring her to the attention of wizard coach scott brook  just a hammon got her opportunity in san antonio because she wa employed the silver star  then owned the same group a the spur  and her w n b a  coach  dan hughes  talked her up to spur coach gregg popovich <BRK> i had a chance to put two party together that i knew would work   hughes  now the head coach of the seattle storm  said   i knew becky  and i also knew pop  and i knew that pop  we had a lot of year of conversation about becky  he had seen her play when i first brought her to san antonio  so to me it wa an opportunity to merge two people that would benefit from each other  <BRK>toliver ha opened up that discussion in significant way  which she said wa a large part of her reasoning for taking the job in the first place  in hughes s eye  it is nothing le than the overdue elimination of whatever combination of sexism and inertia ha prevented the men s basketball world from taking advantage of all the talent amassed on the woman s side of the sport  the next step toward n b a  team and w n b a  team and men s and woman s college basketball program all hiring from the same pool of candidate <BRK>a hughes see it  it s time  not because these woman deserve a chance  but because every baketball team need more coach like hammon  toliver and those who will follow <BRK> i want a world someday where people judge coach on how good a coach they truly are   hughes said   doesn t matter if they re male or female  doesn t matter their background  they can say he s a coach or she s a coach  and we can use them  <BRK>every w n b a  player who stay home instead of playing overseas in her off season  the athlete said  is potentially one more person around which to promote the league year round  and that player get to rest  too  the grind of playing   month a year ha led to w n b a  player like diana taurasi and angel mccoughtry taking season off <BRK> you always want to protect your product   january said   and the majority of our product is being run down and beaten up year round playing this game  so when they come back around to play in the w n b a   you have half of your player injured  playing through nagging thing  we still find a way to have a high talent and high level of basketball  which is crazy to me <BRK> we just have some really strong woman  but that need to be a discussion  what can we do to provide other opportunity for woman to make income and prepare for the future on a real life scale  something they can live on  something that make sense  <BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK>
