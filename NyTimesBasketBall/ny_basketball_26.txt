connecticut faithful  that is  <BRK>and a her mother explained  ogunbowale engenders a two way connection  something of particular import for w n b a  team hoping to win both on the court and at the box office <BRK>liamani segura  the   year old girl who sang the national anthem at the title game  wanted a picture with ogunbowale  segura s father worried ogunbowale wouldn t want to take one after such a difficult loss  but  a segura s father later told yolanda  arike approached segura on her own for that photograph <BRK> so that s the type of person she is   yolanda said of her daughter   the person who  in the midst of that pain  she took her time to do that  <BRK>and so while few expected ogunbowale to be the first overall pick on wednesday night  everyone wanted to hear from her  a she
