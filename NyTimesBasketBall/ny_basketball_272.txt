san francisco starting next season <BRK> we ve got one more before we can seal up the no    seed and take care of that goal   warrior star stephen curry said   these next three game are just about

portland  but the nugget are sitting nikola jokic  paul millsap and jamal murray to rest  which certainly help out the blazer <BRK>houston will be a very big favorite over phoenix  and the rocket

unless the thunder want to see golden state in the first round  they likely need to win this one <BRK>  charlotte at detroit  piston aren t a desperate a the hornet  who need a     finish and help to get in  detroit can still get no    seed <BRK>  brooklyn at indiana  net went to  th on saturday  and will finish there if they win out  pacer know they re likely going to be the   seed <BRK>  phoenix
