 <BRK>  <BRK> on college basketball <BRK> by marc tracy <BRK> if the opinion published friday night in a landmark college sport antitrust case were a novel  then it villain would be the n c a a  <BRK> in a novella length   page opinion  united state district court judge claudia wilken criticizes  berates  even mock the n c a a  for it refusal to allow college to compensate player for their valuable labor beyond a scholarship and related cost of attendance  all in the name of something they call amateurism  <BRK>  defendant nowhere define the nature of the amateurism they claim consumer insist upon   said wilken  referring to the n c a a  and several of it richest  most prominent conference  <BRK> even if they had  wilken continued  she pointed to numerous exception when player could  effectively  be paid  player are paid  beyond scholarship  all the time  in untold million of dollar invested in training facility  in gift for participating in bowl game  in fund available to purchase loss of value insurance  <BRK>  the rule that permit  limit or forbid student athlete compensation and benefit do not follow any coherent definition of amateurism   she said  <BRK> the decision stem from a long running case in which a group of college athlete sued the n c a a  and   athletic conference that participate in the top level of basketball and football  they contended that the ruling body of college sport had colluded to enact a system that unfairly limit the compensation they receive when they are attending and competing for their university  the n c a a  and the conference argue that those limit are essential for promoting amateurism and enhancing the value of college sport and undergraduate education  <BRK> in her decision  wilken seems to say that those rule  did restrain trade   producing  significant anticompetitive effect   <BRK>  the clerk   wilken added on the final page  with the majestic understatement of a good literary denouement   shall enter judgment for the plaintiff class   <BRK> so why doesn t it feel a if the group of athlete who pursued the litigation to end the n c a a  s rule won the cae  why did they and their star sport labor lawyer jeffrey kessler not get the outcome they most fervently sought  <BRK> despite finding that the n c a a  wa violating federal law  wilken turned away the plaintiff  main proposed remedy  which wa also the logical one  to lift the supposedly lawbreaking cap on compensation  that mean the continuation of a status quo where so many player feel they are working basically for free  how s that  <BRK>  when you apply a uniquely muddled set of law to a unique industry  this is the kind of ruling you get   said gabe feldman  who directs tulane s sport law program and teach antitrust law  the unique muddle to which he wa referring   <BRK> the upshot of friday s ruling  pending a likely appeal  is that the n c a a  may continue to cap payment to athlete after all   with the limited exception of expense that are educational in nature  think computer  or cost related to internship  or postgraduate scholarship  <BRK> don t think  stipend of       or       or       because the player receiving it is good enough that he or she is worth even more than that to the college in increased ticket sale  and medium exposure and television right payment  <BRK> no wonder several of the defendant responded this weekend with the kind of equanimity one doe not expect from party that technically lost a case  <BRK> the decision  reaffirms the fundamental principle of the collegiate athletic model and of amateurism   pacific   commissioner larry scott said in a statement   student athlete are first and foremost student  who attend college to receive an education and to prepare themselves for success in life  while also pursuing athletic excellence   <BRK>  scott s statement is more aspirational than descriptive  there are basketball player who conclude their college career before finishing even a year of college   <BRK> similarly  the reaction from player  right advocate wa more muted than you might expect postvictory  <BRK>  this is progress  but it s just one step   ramogi huma  of the college athlete player asociation  said in a text message   this ruling still treat athlete a second clas citizen  no other student or citizen is subject to such harmful economic price fixing  especially one imposed a repeat antitrust violator that doe not have an antitrust exemption   <BRK> how can a judge rule that a law is being broken but allow the lawbreaking to continue  <BRK> according to feldman  the answer includes a much disputed antitrust principle known a the rule of reaon  in some caes   including this one   the rule call for anticompetitive activity to be overturned only if there is a different system that could provide the positive benefit of the anticompetitive system without suppressing other competition a much  <BRK> wilken determined that amateurism wa crucial to college sport  commercial appeal and allowed it to compete with professional sport  even if doing so required it to apparently violate antitrust law  <BRK>  the court doe credit the importance to consumer demand of maintaining a distinction between college sport and professional sport   she said  <BRK> court have given sport league a wide berth when it come to antitrust  feldman said   the argument is that sport are unique   <BRK> after all  sport cannot really exist unless  say    team are allowed to agree to the same rule in men s basketball  even though that might technically constitute collusion in any other realm of commerce  <BRK> wilken wa also following precedent  most of all  she wa following a precedent set the united state court of appeal for the ninth circuit   her circuit  <BRK> in an earlier cae  known a o bannon  the appellate court agreed with part of a wilken finding at the district court level that the n c a a  ban on compensating athlete for the commercial use of their name  image and likeness in thing like video game wa an antitrust violation  but the appellate judge overturned her proposal that athlete be able to receive up to      annually in exchange  the ninth circuit s reaoning wa that such payment were not  tethered to education   <BRK> you can draw a direct line between that phrae  from    and wilken s   ruling in this cae  that is how she solomonically decided that the n c a a  may restrict payment a long a they are noneducational  <BRK>  future plaintiff  if they challenge n c a a  rule  will look for a jurisdiction outside of the ninth circuit   feldman said  the ninth circuit  after all  ha now made it very clear it will defer to the n c a a  <BRK> another venue could rule in a more plaintiff friendly direction  kessler  the prominent sport lawyer  may now be able to push forward with a nearly identical case in federal district court in new jersey  <BRK> either way  the future of college athletics is now out of the hand of wilken  who for nearly a decade ha loomed over it  <BRK> her decision last friday may be a result of her understanding her power and it limit  numerous observer expected a more plaintiff friendly ruling based on the question she asked during trial  <BRK> yet here we are  with little change  <BRK>  this finding did not surprise me   said gerald gurney  a former head of the reform minded drake group  <BRK>  even though she may have wanted to completely agree with kessler s argument   gurney added   she did have some constraint   <BRK> opinionthe
