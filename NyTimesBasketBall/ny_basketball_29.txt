 <BRK>  <BRK> on pro basketball <BRK> by marc stein <BRK> the knicks  sudden trade sending kristaps porzingis  their franchise player  to the dallas maverick last week ha raised a swirl of question about the team s motivation  <BRK> good news  we have answer  <BRK> porzingis wa abruptly dispatched to dallas last thursday  along with tim hardaway jr   courtney lee and trey burke  for guard dennis smith jr   two future first round pick and the sizable expiring contract of deandre jordan and wes matthew  <BRK> let s dig into six of the biggest curiosity surrounding the departure of the knicks  beloved no     <BRK> steve mill  the knicks  president  cited worry that porzingis wa growing detached from the organization a a key factor in the team s decision to seek out trade for the best big man it ha seen since patrick ewing  <BRK> it turn out that the knicks spent much of january quietly canvasing the league for potential porzingis deal  according to a person familiar with the talk who wa not authorized to discus them publicly  they tried   unsuccessfully   to trade for untouchable such a utah s donovan mitchell and sacramento s de aaron fox  <BRK> but the knicks knew all along that the maverick had the wherewithal to meet many of their trade objective and  just a crucially  that dalla wa generally unfazed the torn anterior cruciate ligament porzingis suffered lat february  <BRK> in smith  dallas had a recent top   pick to offer  the maverick also proved willing to give up two future first round draft pick in a porzingis deal while absorbing the contract of hardaway and lee  the knicks were able to shed both of those deal because dallas had two huge expiring contract to send back  jordan and matthew  and had long been fond of hardaway despite his defensive deficiency  <BRK> perhaps you are a smith skeptic  or just a knicks skeptic  those are both understandable position  but a trade that return three quality asset and will create the kind of salary cap space this summer that the knicks must have to chase kevin durant and kyrie irving in free agency is no salary dump  <BRK> it is a gamble  true  but it is also an undeniable haul  <BRK> the maverick  interest in porzingis ha been an open secret to the knicks for year  one maverick official estimated that dallas approached the knicks  about a hundred time  before the team ever showed any willingness to discus trading him  <BRK> the knicks  for their part  had expressed interest in smith all seaon  the team  according to two people with knowledge of their talk  also had been discussing a hardaway for matthew trade for week before jan     which both side pinpoint a the first date the knicks were open to discussing a porzingis blockbuster  <BRK> the party  a a result  did not need long to build a trade framework  <BRK> it certainly did not hurt that the maverick made their lone madison square garden appearance of the season two night later  knicks general manager scott perry and his maverick counterpart  donnie nelson  met before the game in a garden hallway before taking their huddle behind closed door and summoning mill  <BRK> by night s end  smith had registered a triple double in a resounding dallas victory and the maverick were offering to seal the porzingis deal handshake  since mark cuban  the dallas owner  wa in the building  the knicks  however  asked for more time  <BRK> the reason  porzingis and his brother janis  the player s agent  had requested a thursday morning meeting  <BRK> when asked at a monday news conference to address his reported desire to be traded  porzingis passed  <BRK>  i would rather just focus on what s ahead of me than looking back   porzingis said  <BRK> a person with knowledge of the meeting  however  said it wa requested the porzingis brother   after they had canceled a similar meeting earlier in january   and that it lasted le than five minute  later in the day  according to the person  janis porzingis gave the knicks a list of four team he and kristaps had deemed acceptable trade destination  <BRK> the net and the los angeles clipper were among those four team  but dallas wa not  the knicks  meanwhile  were told porzingis wa prepared to leave the team and continue his knee rehabilitation in spain if he wa not moved thursday s   p m  trade deadline  <BRK> it wa not long after receiving the four team list that the knicks notified the maverick they would do the deal  <BRK> the knicks were convinced that no team besides dallas would take the hardaway and lee contract and package a player of smith s caliber with first round draft pick  <BRK> the knicks also were fearful that letting the dallas offer linger  or engaging other team in the week leading up to the trade deadline  would enable the porzingis camp to scare off the maverick or other potential suitor threatening to sign long term only with team like the net or the clipper  <BRK> in a radio interview monday with     fm in dallas  cuban said   shopping a deal is a lot more complicated than it sound   <BRK> risky a it would be given his uncertain health  porzingis ha the option to play next seaon for a mere      million and become an unrestricted free agent in july    the knicks  mounting fear that he would exercise that option  or say he wa only willing to sign a one year deal with a player option in year    are largely what convinced team official they had to pursue trade  <BRK> but the maverick are one of those dice rolling team  like boston  houston and most recently oklahoma city when it traded for paul george  that bet on themselves in these situation  dallas is already expressing confidence it can get porzingis s signature on a five year     million contract this summer  <BRK> porzingis ha pre existing relationship with dirk nowitzki and luka doncic  the maverick  rising star from slovenia  and neither maverick coach rick carlisle nor cuban ha been bashful about comparing a doncic porzingis partnership to the nowitzki steve nash duo that wa busted up after just six season  nash wa allowed to sign with phoenix in july    after which both nowitzki and nash won most valuable player honor separately  <BRK>  it wa my mistake to not keep dirk and steve together longer   cuban said monday night   i won t make the same mistake with luka and k p   <BRK> it is simply not possible to answer this today  not without knowing  for starter  how the knicks will fare in free agency   and how porzingis will bounce back from his knee injury  <BRK> but i can tell you this  in my discussion with rival team executive  i have heard from many more who praise the trade than those who question how much the knicks received in return  <BRK> also  the threat of the knicks persuading durant to leave one of the most dominant team in league history  based on the latest vibe emanating from the bay area  ha never felt more real to the warrior themselves  <BRK> the knicks have received considerable criticism for smearing porzingis on his way out  and let s face it  believe it when i see it scoffing at the notion that the game s biggest name would be willing to play for the knicks  when they are still owned and operated james dolan  is fully expected given how the last two decade have gone since the knicks  trip to the n b a  final in    <BRK> yet there is far more to like than dislike about the deal  even if porzingis becomes everything dalla dream he can be  the knicks move forward with masive financial flexibility and a young core of smith  kevin knox  allonzo trier and frank ntilikina  a well a seven first round pick over the next five year   chip they can either build around or offer in trade for someone starry like anthony davis  <BRK> processing all that should bring knicks loving new yorkers some winter warmth  <BRK>  <BRK>
