were victimized the defendant  attempt to secure them top talent  albeit while putting them at risk of n c a a  penalty  <BRK> if he thought that anyone would conceive what he did here a a crime  he would never have done it   code s lawyer  mark moore  said of his client <BRK>comparing the situation in the case to a legal principle called the  doctrine of unclean hand   moore suggested that

itself exonerating   the  everybody s doing it  argument  in short  is not a get out of jail free card   he said <BRK>but the judge also recognized that the alleged behavior of university employee like assistant coach and  perhaps  the interest of the university themselves complicated the theory of the case   on which a jury convicted   that the university were victim <BRK>referring to brian
