<BRK><BRK>on pro basketball<BRK>by marc stein<BRK>los angeles   there wa a moment during the golden state warrior  morning walk through on friday that shaun livingston  even after his   seen it all season in the n b a   felt a need to pause in admiration of what wa happening <BRK>so livingston stared out onto the floor at staple center and tried to process that demarcus cousin had indeed joined the starry quartet of stephen curry  kevin durant  klay thompson and draymond green to run through some defensive instruction   a a unit <BRK> i m not going to lie   livingston said   i saw the five of them together and for a second  i wa like   wow  that s a fantasy squad    <BRK>the rest of the warrior would go on to enjoy their own fantay becomes reality moment friday night  finally making his debut with the two time reigning champion  after nearly a year in injury exile  cousin frankly looked a joyful a we ve ever seen him in an n b a  game  logging four effective stint for a total of   minute   second in a     road rout of the los angeles clipper <BRK>there were a few awkward drive to the rim  more than a few of his familiar grumble to the referee and six foul in those   minute  but cousin also racked up an impressive   point    rebound and   assist  despite cousin s rust and apparent lack of conditioning  golden state outscored the clipper   point in his time on the floor before he fouled out <BRK> this is his night   curry said afterward <BRK>it certainly wa  the   foot   inch cousin hammered home a vicious dunk for his first baket a a warrior  ran the floor with aplomb  hounded the various clipper he guarded one on one into   for   shooting  found a cutting curry for a layup with a nifty bounce pas out of the post  took a charge against a driving tobia harris and  most notably  drained three   pointer <BRK>two of those   s  early in the fourth quarter   really broke the whole game open   warrior coach steve kerr said <BRK>most of all  cousin smiled  he smiled and laughed a lot  he soaked in a celebratory water dousing on live tv from curry and thompson  proudly awarded the game ball to his mother  monique  and came away from his first real game action in   day proclaiming it  probably one of the best day of my life  <BRK> like a kid on christmas   cousin said <BRK>and that might be the most ominous aspect of cousin s long anticipated bow with the juggernaut he joined on a bargain deal via free agency last summer  that one year deal  worth just      million  came amid leaguewide concern about how cousin would respond to a torn achilles  tendon in his left foot  historically one of the sport s most devastating injury  the resultant skepticism wiped out most of his free agent market <BRK>yet cousin  just one game into the warrior experiment  already look content and comfortable with this group <BRK>if that continues <BRK> thing should only get better from here   curry said <BRK>said kerr of cousin s teammate   they all love him  he s a really good teammate  he s an emotional guy  but he s loved  <BRK>even with a playful nickname like boogie  there have been few happy occaion in the pro for cousin  who ha played more n b a  game     than any other active player without a tate of the postseaon and had been sidelined since he shredded his achilles  a a member of the new orleans pelican on jan       <BRK>but his desire to find a productive role with the franchise that ha won three title over the past four season wa very clear on friday night  playing in short burst to start every quarter  cousin     still found the time to flash every facet of the versatile skill set that  when it neutralizes the emotional side that kerr referenced  ha long made him one of the league s most tantalizing talent <BRK> he s going to help them   clipper coach doc river said forlornly   he doe so many thing  <BRK>in the  th game of what curry himself described a a  very dramatic  seaon for the warrior  cousin s return also helped golden state shed some of the aftertate from it lat visit here to play the clipper   when a naty argument on the bench between durant and green led to green s one game suspension without pay and considerable tension afterward <BRK>those scene seemed particularly dated on friday even a curry cat a wary eye on all the gushing sure to emerge in coming day about how mighty golden state now look with all five of it reigning all star in uniform <BRK> we re not going to drink all the kool aid   curry promised  insisting that the integration of cousin remains  a work in progress   <BRK>still  no n b a  team ha been able to trot out a lineup featuring five all star from the previous season since the     boston celtic  well aware of such history  kerr tried before tipoff to convince his player to tune out the external noise <BRK> there s going to be instant judgment  analysis and criticism   kerr said after the morning shootaround   we re either going to be  at the end of the night  unbeatable or in big trouble  <BRK>asked after friday s emphatic triumph if it wa thus safe to proclaim his team unbeatable  kerr joked   yes  please go ahead  season s over  <BRK>while thing aren t quite that hopeless for the league s other   team  it sure seems a though a new seaon just started for the warrior  who are back atop the western conference despite a     record that isn t a gaudy a usual  the clipper might have been short handed without the injured lou williams and with a hobbled danilo gallinari  but the warrior  ability to slot cousin in among their marquee foursome or mix him in with trusted reserve such a livingston and andre iguodala quickly made them look a dangerous a they ever have during their championship run <BRK>noting that he wasn t being double teamed no matter what the lineup on the floor were  cousin called it  a first  in his career <BRK> i can get used to this   he said <BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK>
