giannis or harden for m v p   who make the warrior better  steph or k d   marc stein considers these question and more in the latest edition of his newsletter <BRK>milwaukee s giannis antetokounmpo is a leading candidate for this season s most valuable player award creditcreditmorry gash associated press<BRK><BRK>by marc stein<BRK> want to get this newsletter from marc stein each week   for free  sign up here  <BRK>a the     regular seaon dribble to a close  with just two night and   of     game to go  voter leaguewide are finalizing their year end award ballot in six major category  <BRK>i am no longer one of them  because the new york time doe not permit it reporter to vote for such award  but it s still a useful exercise a we take stock of the seaon to break down each race and who i would have picked <BRK>official selection are due friday night and there is simply no wrong answer when choosing between antetokounmpo and houston s james harden for the top spot on the five man m v p  ballot <BRK>i have always approached this category trying to identify who had the best overall seaon   baed on a subjective and imprecise mixture of individual and team success   rather than paying attention to the noise about which player is most widely regarded a the game s best   or the best two way player   or any other such designation <BRK>so who had the better     seaon  i would go  ever so narrowly  with giannis  on top of all his individual superlative  antetokounmpo ha been the face and chief culture setter in the buck  transformation from   win underachiever to the best team in the league  regular seaon edition   and his candidacy get bonus point on our scorecard because milwaukee  for eatern conference supremacy  had to beat out a trio of worthy challenger who were all projected a superior before the seaon <BRK>harden would be tremendously unlucky to finish second in m v p  balloting for the third time in five season  but i think that s where this is headed  he is going to be the first scoring champion      point per game  to win the scoring title more than eight point per game since michael jordan did over dominique wilkins in      and i tend to agree with houston coach mike d antoni s contention that harden is the only player capable of hauling the injury riddled rocket to   victory out of the     hole they were in  harden simply ha the misfortune of doing all that damage in a season that belonged to antetokounmpo and the buck <BRK>it feel a though i have been writing and tweeting about doncic and his atlanta hawk counterpart trae young all seaon  i suspect i will be writing about the two of them for the next decade plus  and i m fine with that <BRK>doncic ha had the start to finish stronger campaign and continued to look like a franchise player even though the maverick steadily increased his year   workload after trading away four fifth of their starting lineup in february  the trade brought in kristaps porzingis and better position dallas to build out a supporting cast tailored to their electric european import <BRK>young ha delivered even more impressive post all star break production      point per game and     assist per game  for a scrappy hawk team with a passable record of     since it dismal     start   and an increasingly bright future <BRK>doncic is going to win the race  but young overcame his own worrisome launch to make it a competition   and a rivalry that should have staying power   with his second half surge <BRK>doncic will be remembered a the only rookie in n b a  history not named oscar robertson to average at leat   point    rebound and   asists  and young can take solace in being almost a unfortunate a harden if he doesn t win the hardware  it s quite a compliment when you think about it <BRK>had the indiana pacer won   game in a season in which victor oladipo wa healthy enough to play only    nate mcmillan would have the résumé to deny the buck  budenholzer  i m not sure mcmillan is mile off with   win <BRK>doc river of the los angeles clipper  like mcmillan  is another victim of bad timing  river han t had a team overachieve like these starless clipper since his rookie seaon on the bench with orlando in     when the magic won a wholly unexpected   game in a seaon billed a a placeholder before a splahy free agent summer that ultimately landed grant hill and tracy mcgrady in the magic kingdom <BRK>but milwaukee s improvement in budenholzer s first season ha been so dramatic that i can t see how he doesn t win his second coach of the year trophy  perhaps some voter will try to convince themselves that the buck would be getting too much love if they vote for both giannis for m v p  and bud for this honor  but we re talking about the league s only   win team   and the runaway champion in average point differential for the season          and the only team in the league to rank in the top five in both offensive and defensive efficiency <BRK>antetokounmpo is the biggest reason all that is possible  general manager jon horst is likewise on an impressive run of roster move  but budenholzer s impact ha been undeniable <BRK>honorable mention  along with mcmillan and river  denver s mike malone  brooklyn s kenny atkinson  portland s terry stotts  orlando s steve clifford  detroit s dwane casey  golden state s steve kerr and  of course  san antonio s gregg popovich <BRK>manu ginobili  who just had his familiar no    retired the san antonio spur  used to be synonymous with sixth man excellence to me  ditto for jamal crawford <BRK>yet i d say williams wear that crown now <BRK>the clipper  designated scorer won this award lat seaon and stand a a huge favorite to join crawford a the league s only three time winner   despite the challenge he s getting from teammate montrezl harrell <BRK>someone from the clipper ha to win some year end recognition in light of the cinderella season they ve assembled  williams make the most sense over a quality field that also feature harrell  indiana s domantas sabonis  brooklyn s spencer dinwiddie  new orleans  julius randle and san antonio s davis bertans <BRK>a the self proclaimed overseer of the all lefty team  it pain me to snub both d angelo russell of the net and sacramento s de aaron fox in this category <BRK>but i ve been saying for year that ultra high former draft pick like russell and second year player like fox are not going to be most improved candidate for me  russell made a tremendous  inspiring leap to all star status in brooklyn this seaon  but the wow factor partly stem from the fact that he fell so far short of expectation in his first three seaon  fox  meanwhile  made the sort of year   to year   leap sacramento wa counting on from someone it billed a a franchise cornerstone <BRK>no one expected siakam to become an impact player at both end and a borderline all star who helped the raptor to post   win amid the   game kawhi leonard missed for various reason of injury and precaution <BRK>the nostalgic sap in me  truth be told  wanted to go with minnesota s resurgent derrick rose  but d rose only wound up being healthy enough to appear in   game   and a a former m v p  he s more of a comeback player of the year than a most improved candidate  the n b a  s specific instruction in this category read a follows   this award is designed to honor an up and coming player who ha made a dramatic improvement from the previous seaon or seaons  it is not intended to be given to a player who ha made a  comeback    <BRK>siakam  in other word  is perfect  he s a former no    overall pick who zoomed from role player to foundational player   either beside leonard or in a post kawhi world should leonard flee canada in free agency this summer <BRK>antetokounmpo is a leading candidate here  too  a is oklahoma city s paul george and indiana s myles turner  but the buck  at leat on this mythical ballot  will have to settle for two of the six top prize <BRK>three would have been too many  especially since utah s gobert remains such a dominant deterrent at the rim in his role a the anchor for a defense that officially rank no    but is essentially on par with milwaukee s <BRK> marc stein s newsletter will have the latest on the n b a  playoff  which start saturday  sign up here  <BRK>you ak  i answer  every week in this space  i ll field three question posed via email at marcstein newsletter nytimes com   pleae include your first and lat name  a well a the city you re writing in from  and make sure the subject line read  corner three   <BRK>q  deandre ayton han t had a terrible rookie year  but it ha paled in comparison to what we ve seen from luka doncic and trae young  what do you think ayton need to improve on   and will he ever match luka or trae s potential    henry roth  scottsdale  ariz  <BRK>stein  it speaks to how far the sun have faded from prominence that ayton  a the no    overall pick lat june  got so little attention given the number he posted      point and     rebound per game  <BRK>the leaguewide facination with doncic and young is also a factor  a you mentioned  but ayton wa overlooked in the extreme this seaon  sun fan should be hoping that the snub help motivate ayton in year    because consistency and sustained energy have been issue for him so far <BRK>from a technical standpoint  ayton ha to develop into more of a rim protector  with his mobility and athleticism  phoenix should be able to build a defense around him  he s not close to elite yet at that end <BRK>but it would also be unfair to ignore that ayton wa frequently forced to start alongside two other rookie on a squad that still doesn t have a starter level n b a  point guard <BRK>q  dirk nowitzki han t come out and said he is retiring  but everyone else seems to be saying it  at first i didn t believe adam silver would have put dirk in the all star game if he didn t have it on good authority that dirk would soon retire  but could this actually not be his final year  it look like dirk s ankle ha finally recovered from surgery and he s moving a lot better  why not play one more season with luka doncic and kristaps porzingis and try to go out with a playoff berth    sharad acharya<BRK>stein  this much i can tell you  dirk joining dwyane wade in the all star game a a so called  commissioner s pick  ha nothing to do with nowitzki s retirement plan  a dirk stated before  during and after his trip to charlotte  this wa his all star swan song no matter what  even if he decided to play next seaon <BRK>i think there have been time since the all star break when an encouraged nowitzki ha imagined himself carrying on  he s been a huge porzingis fan for year and would naturally love to experience the doncic porzingis tandem  but the reality is that season no    ha been a bigger challenge physically than he ever imagined <BRK>is it really worth putting his body through the rigor of yet another nine month ride  the cae against coming back is much stronger than the cae for it  which is why you ve heard the like of mark cuban and steve nah give interview in recent day that make it sound a though the end is near <BRK>q  i d like to hear your thought on how stephen curry make everyone else on the floor better and how that may not necessarily be the case with kevin durant    michael dortheimer<BRK>stein  anyone who belief this must not have watched the last two n b a  final <BRK>steph is golden state s no    playmaker and a true revolutionary when it come to the way his seemingly limitless shooting range bend defense <BRK>but there s a reason durant ha won back to back m v p  trophy in the final  he s the best finisher in the game and wa the best player on the floor on the game s grandest stage two year in a row <BRK>the warrior are     in the playoff since durant arrived  who would dare say he doesn t make all of the other warrior better just being out there <BRK>curry ha the ball in his hand more  which surely fuel the perception you describe  but durant command more double team than any other warrior and is a great paser both out of the post and in pick and roll situation  there is no shortage of coach and scout around the league who regard him a an elite playmaker <BRK>this is the fifth time in the knicks    season history that they ve had the league s worst record  the first three time  there were fewer than   team in the league           in an eight team league            in a nine team league  and          in a nine team league   the knicks were also at the bottom of a   team league in     at      <BRK>at     so far this season  the knicks will post the lowest win total in franchise history unless they win at least one of their final two game  <BRK>utah s rudy gobert is poised to finish this season with more dunk than anyone else  with   dunk to antetokounmpo s   for milwaukee  gobert  though  ha played in all   of utah s game this season  antetokounmpo ha missed   of the buck    game to date  <BRK>antetokounmpo s buck finished  th in defensive rating last season  they ve climbed   spot this season to rank no    overall entering tuesday s play  allowing     point per   possession  <BRK>jason terry s   regular season game alongside dirk are the most of any teammate in nowitzki s   season in dallas  j j  barea rank second  and no    among active maverick  with   regular season game  the maverick say nowitzki ha had   teammate <BRK>this is the  th consecutive season  according to the peerless data maintained basketball reference com  during which the
