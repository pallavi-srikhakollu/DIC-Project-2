gianni or harden for m v p   who make the warrior better  steph or k d   marc stein consid these question and more in the latest edit of his newslett <BRK>milwauke s gianni antetokounmpo is a lead candid for this season s most valuabl player award creditcreditmorri gash associ press<BRK><BRK>by marc stein<BRK> want to get this newslett from marc stein each week   for free  sign up here  <BRK>as the     regular season dribbl to a close  with just two night and   of     game to go  voter leaguewid are final their year end award ballot in six major categori  <BRK>i am no longer one of them  becaus the new york time doe not permit it report to vote for such award  but it s still a use exercis as we take stock of the season to break down each race and who i would have pick <BRK>offici select are due friday night and there is simpli no wrong answer when choos between antetokounmpo and houston s jame harden for the top spot on the five man m v p  ballot <BRK>i have alway approach this categori tri to identifi who had the best overal season   base on a subject and imprecis mixtur of individu and team success   rather than pay attent to the nois about which player is most wide regard as the game s best   or the best two way player   or ani other such design <BRK>so who had the better     season  i would go  ever so narrowli  with gianni  on top of all his individu superl  antetokounmpo has been the face and chief cultur setter in the buck  transform from   win underachiev to the best team in the leagu  regular season edit   and his candidaci get bonus point on our scorecard becaus milwauke  for eastern confer supremaci  had to beat out a trio of worthi challeng who were all project as superior befor the season <BRK>harden would be tremend unlucki to finish second in m v p  ballot for the third time in five season  but i think that s where this is head  he is go to be the first score champion      point per game  to win the score titl more than eight point per game sinc michael jordan did over dominiqu wilkin in      and i tend to agre with houston coach mike d antoni s content that harden is the onli player capabl of haul the injuri riddl rocket to   victori out of the     hole they were in  harden simpli has the misfortun of do all that damag in a season that belong to antetokounmpo and the buck <BRK>it feel as though i have been write and tweet about doncic and his atlanta hawk counterpart trae young all season  i suspect i will be write about the two of them for the next decad plus  and i m fine with that <BRK>doncic has had the start to finish stronger campaign and continu to look like a franchis player even though the maverick steadili increas his year   workload after trade away four fifth of their start lineup in februari  the trade brought in kristap porzingi and better posit dalla to build out a support cast tailor to their electr european import <BRK>young has deliv even more impress post all star break product      point per game and     assist per game  for a scrappi hawk team with a passabl record of     sinc it dismal     start   and an increas bright futur <BRK>doncic is go to win the race  but young overcam his own worrisom launch to make it a competit   and a rivalri that should have stay power   with his second half surg <BRK>doncic will be rememb as the onli rooki in n b a  histori not name oscar robertson to averag at least   point    rebound and   assist  and young can take solac in be almost as unfortun as harden if he doesn t win the hardwar  it s quit a compliment when you think about it <BRK>had the indiana pacer won   game in a season in which victor oladipo was healthi enough to play onli    nate mcmillan would have the résumé to deni the buck  budenholz  i m not sure mcmillan is mile off with   win <BRK>doc river of the los angel clipper  like mcmillan  is anoth victim of bad time  river hasn t had a team overachiev like these starless clipper sinc his rooki season on the bench with orlando in     when the magic won a wholli unexpect   game in a season bill as a placehold befor a splashi free agent summer that ultim land grant hill and traci mcgradi in the magic kingdom <BRK>but milwauke s improv in budenholz s first season has been so dramat that i can t see how he doesn t win his second coach of the year trophi  perhap some voter will tri to convinc themselv that the buck would be get too much love if they vote for both gianni for m v p  and bud for this honor  but we re talk about the leagu s onli   win team   and the runaway champion in averag point differenti for the season          and the onli team in the leagu to rank in the top five in both offens and defens effici <BRK>antetokounmpo is the biggest reason all that is possibl  general manag jon horst is likewis on an impress run of roster move  but budenholz s impact has been undeni <BRK>honor mention  along with mcmillan and river  denver s mike malon  brooklyn s kenni atkinson  portland s terri stott  orlando s steve clifford  detroit s dwane casey  golden state s steve kerr and  of cours  san antonio s gregg popovich <BRK>manu ginobili  who just had his familiar no    retir the san antonio spur  use to be synonym with sixth man excel to me  ditto for jamal crawford <BRK>yet i d say william wear that crown now <BRK>the clipper  design scorer won this award last season and stand as a huge favorit to join crawford as the leagu s onli three time winner   despit the challeng he s get from teammat montrezl harrel <BRK>someon from the clipper has to win some year end recognit in light of the cinderella season they ve assembl  william make the most sens over a qualiti field that also featur harrel  indiana s domanta saboni  brooklyn s spencer dinwiddi  new orlean  julius randl and san antonio s davi bertan <BRK>as the self proclaim overs of the all lefti team  it pain me to snub both d angelo russel of the net and sacramento s de aaron fox in this categori <BRK>but i ve been say for year that ultra high former draft pick like russel and second year player like fox are not go to be most improv candid for me  russel made a tremend  inspir leap to all star status in brooklyn this season  but the wow factor part stem from the fact that he fell so far short of expect in his first three season  fox  meanwhil  made the sort of year   to year   leap sacramento was count on from someon it bill as a franchis cornerston <BRK>no one expect siakam to becom an impact player at both end and a borderlin all star who help the raptor to post   win amid the   game kawhi leonard miss for various reason of injuri and precaut <BRK>the nostalg sap in me  truth be told  want to go with minnesota s resurg derrick rose  but d rose onli wound up be healthi enough to appear in   game   and as a former m v p  he s more of a comeback player of the year than a most improv candid  the n b a  s specif instruct in this categori read as follow   this award is design to honor an up and come player who has made a dramat improv from the previous season or season  it is not intend to be given to a player who has made a  comeback    <BRK>siakam  in other word  is perfect  he s a former no    overal pick who zoom from role player to foundat player   either besid leonard or in a post kawhi world should leonard flee canada in free agenc this summer <BRK>antetokounmpo is a lead candid here  too  as is oklahoma citi s paul georg and indiana s myle turner  but the buck  at least on this mythic ballot  will have to settl for two of the six top prize <BRK>three would have been too mani  especi sinc utah s gobert remain such a domin deterr at the rim in his role as the anchor for a defens that offici rank no    but is essenti on par with milwauke s <BRK> marc stein s newslett will have the latest on the n b a  playoff  which start saturday  sign up here  <BRK>you ask  i answer  everi week in this space  i ll field three question pose via email at marcstein newslett nytim com   pleas includ your first and last name  as well as the citi you re write in from  and make sure the subject line read  corner three   <BRK>q  deandr ayton hasn t had a terribl rooki year  but it has pale in comparison to what we ve seen from luka doncic and trae young  what do you think ayton need to improv on   and will he ever match luka or trae s potenti    henri roth  scottsdal  ariz  <BRK>stein  it speak to how far the sun have fade from promin that ayton  as the no    overal pick last june  got so littl attent given the number he post      point and     rebound per game  <BRK>the leaguewid fascin with doncic and young is also a factor  as you mention  but ayton was overlook in the extrem this season  sun fan should be hope that the snub help motiv ayton in year    becaus consist and sustain energi have been issu for him so far <BRK>from a technic standpoint  ayton has to develop into more of a rim protector  with his mobil and athletic  phoenix should be abl to build a defens around him  he s not close to elit yet at that end <BRK>but it would also be unfair to ignor that ayton was frequent forc to start alongsid two other rooki on a squad that still doesn t have a starter level n b a  point guard <BRK>q  dirk nowitzki hasn t come out and said he is retir  but everyon els seem to be say it  at first i didn t believ adam silver would have put dirk in the all star game if he didn t have it on good author that dirk would soon retir  but could this actual not be his final year  it look like dirk s ankl has final recov from surgeri and he s move a lot better  whi not play one more season with luka doncic and kristap porzingi and tri to go out with a playoff berth    sharad acharya<BRK>stein  this much i can tell you  dirk join dwyan wade in the all star game as a so call  commission s pick  has noth to do with nowitzki s retir plan  as dirk state befor  dure and after his trip to charlott  this was his all star swan song no matter what  even if he decid to play next season <BRK>i think there have been time sinc the all star break when an encourag nowitzki has imagin himself carri on  he s been a huge porzingi fan for year and would natur love to experi the doncic porzingi tandem  but the realiti is that season no    has been a bigger challeng physic than he ever imagin <BRK>is it realli worth put his bodi through the rigor of yet anoth nine month ride  the case against come back is much stronger than the case for it  which is whi you ve heard the like of mark cuban and steve nash give interview in recent day that make it sound as though the end is near <BRK>q  i d like to hear your thought on how stephen curri make everyon els on the floor better and how that may not necessarili be the case with kevin durant    michael dortheim<BRK>stein  anyon who believ this must not have watch the last two n b a  final <BRK>steph is golden state s no    playmak and a true revolutionari when it come to the way his seem limitless shoot rang bend defens <BRK>but there s a reason durant has won back to back m v p  trophi in the final  he s the best finish in the game and was the best player on the floor on the game s grandest stage two year in a row <BRK>the warrior are     in the playoff sinc durant arriv  who would dare say he doesn t make all of the other warrior better just be out there <BRK>curri has the ball in his hand more  which sure fuel the percept you describ  but durant command more doubl team than ani other warrior and is a great passer both out of the post and in pick and roll situat  there is no shortag of coach and scout around the leagu who regard him as an elit playmak <BRK>this is the fifth time in the knick    season histori that they ve had the leagu s worst record  the first three time  there were fewer than   team in the leagu           in an eight team leagu            in a nine team leagu  and          in a nine team leagu   the knick were also at the bottom of a   team leagu in     at      <BRK>at     so far this season  the knick will post the lowest win total in franchis histori unless they win at least one of their final two game  <BRK>utah s rudi gobert is pois to finish this season with more dunk than anyon els  with   dunk to antetokounmpo s   for milwauke  gobert  though  has play in all   of utah s game this season  antetokounmpo has miss   of
