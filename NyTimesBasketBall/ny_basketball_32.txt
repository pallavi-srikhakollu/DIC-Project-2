<BRK><BRK>by kelly whiteside<BRK>knicks coach david fizdale pulled at the edge of his graying beard a he dissected his team s latest blowout loss  leading a team that is now      the worst record in the n b a   fizdale ha had to search hard for trace of sunshine <BRK>a he answered question from reporter at a recent postgame news conference  the frame of his trademark glases looked a broken a the franchise itself  the damaged black frame were held together a glop of glue  fizdale had cracked them earlier in the seaon <BRK>it is eay to say now  but with   game remaining the knicks seem to have been lost from the start  they began the seaon with the youngest roster in the n b a   with an average age of le than     year old  development became the mantra with fizdale  who in his first seaon a the knicks head coach ha frequently referred to his player a  kid   inexperience  a revolving door rotation  and the absence of kristaps porzingis   the star forward who ha been out injured since february     compounded the losing <BRK>now  after last week s trade that sent porzingis to the dallas maverick ended any hope that he might return to save the season  the knicks could be in danger of finishing with the worst record in franchise history  the low mark wa a     record during the     season  they have lost   in a row    of the last   and a franchise record   consecutive game at home  not surprisingly  they were  th in the league in offensive rating and  th in defensive rating entering monday night s game <BRK>of course  knicks fan have become inured to the losing   this will be the team s sixth consecutive season without a winning record  other than the     season  when the knicks reached the eastern conference semifinal  it ha been nearly two decade since the team advanced beyond the first round of the playoff <BRK>newcomer like kevin knox  mitchell robinson and allonzo trier may be the future  but injury and inconsistency have marred the present  knox  the   foot   forward chosen ninth over all in last year s draft  is one of the youngest player in the league  at    in december he earned eastern conference rookie of the month honor  but his     shooting percentage need to improve <BRK>the knicks took a gamble on the   foot   robinson when they selected him in the second round of june s draft   th over all  he wa the only player in last year s draft who did not play in college  overseas or in the n b a  s developmental league  instead  robinson took a year off from organized basketball after high school to get ready for the draft <BRK>trier  a   foot   guard  went undrafted after three season at arizona  but his early impressive play led to a two year     million deal with the knicks <BRK>the knicks  front office ha been lauded for it savvy pick in last year s draft and it recent acquisition of reclamation project  that acumen will be tested in june  the knicks  who own a first round draft pick  will have the chance to select an impact player with their winning by losing approach <BRK>the more they lose  the better their chance are of landing duke s zion williamson or another highly coveted prospect  still  it is not a slam dunk   even if the knicks fail to win   game this year  being the worst team in the n b a  used to provide a greater advantage in the draft lottery  because the league changed the rule to deter team from tanking  the bottom three team now share the same   percent odds of winning the no    pick  previously  the worst team held a   percent chance <BRK> obviously  you always want to win  every game we play we re trying to win   fizdale ha said <BRK>but what if the knicks actually did start winning  boosted the three player acquired in the porzingis trade with dallas  the knicks gained the promising guard dennis smith jr   who wa a first round draft pick in    and the expiring contract of the veteran deandre jordan and wesley matthew  plus two future first round pick  porzingis  tim hardaway jr   courtney lee and trey burke were shipped to the maverick <BRK>the knicks  newcomer knew only a few of the team s offensive play before making their debut against memphis on sunday  with smith jr  and jordan starting  both made standout play early  smith scored his first basket on a drive into the lane with an up and under layup and added another in a fast break opportunity  jordan registered a block  followed an alley oop dunk off an assist from smith  all this competent basketball made some knicks fan nervous  leading to some angst ridden gallows humor on social medium <BRK>the knicks held on for the loss      <BRK>with smith and jordan in the starting lineup  the knicks have continued their season theme of roster roulette  fizdale ha stitched together   five man lineup that have played   or more minute together this season  but of those group  only five lineup have played   or more minute together <BRK>consider center ene kanter  who started   game but lost his starting job a the team decided to focu on developing it younger player  he did not go quietly to the end of the bench   i ll go out and do my job and help my team win   he said in late december   if we re winning  it s good  but if we re losing it s a problem  if this adjutment is going to get u a win  cool  but if not  there s a problem  <BRK>but lately the most vocal cheer at madison square garden ha been   we want kanter   a he sits on the bench  after four consecutive game in which he did not play  kanter entered the game against dalla lat week  went to his knee and kissed the midcourt garden logo  he explained later that he wanted to show his love for the fan since it could be one of his final game a a knick  with the trade deadline looming <BRK>in the second quarter against memphis on sunday  fizdale looked down the bench and called for  dennis   referring to the newly acquired point guard dennis smith jr  kanter  however  heard  ene  and started for the scorer s table until he wa stopped the assistant coach keith smart <BRK> he wanted to run all the way to the scorer s table  make it a bigger spectacle   fizdale said  but the damage  a it is with the knicks  wa already done <BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK>
