<BRK><BRK>by daniel victor<BRK>in his two year a president of baketball operation for the los angeles lakers  magic johnson presided over a team a chaotic and playoff free a the one he d inherited <BRK>the lakers succeeded in stockpiling talent   including the franchise altering signing of lebron james   but failed in putting together complementary piece  or attracting the second major star johnson openly said he wa chasing <BRK> magic johnson stunned the basketball world suddenly stepping down on tuesday  <BRK>here s a look back at johnson s high and low point while running the team <BRK>in february    four seaon into the team s longest ever playoff drought  the lakers reshuffled their front office firing the general manager  mitch kupchak  and installing johnson a it president  le than a month later  rob pelinka  a longtime agent  wa hired a the general manager  reporting to johnson <BRK>officially and unofficially  johnson had remained tied to the team since he retired in    he owned a share of the team from   to    and after that he wa an honorary vice president   a title the team took away from him after he violated the league s tampering rule tweeting about free agent <BRK>three week before he wa hired in his new role  he had returned to the lakers a an adviser to jeanie bus  the team s president and co owner  she would soon clean house while promoting johnson <BRK> everyone associated with the lakers will now be pulling in the same direction  the direction established earvin and myself   she said  using johnson s given name   we are determined to get back to competing to win n b a  championship again  <BRK>the first major test of the new regime had decidedly mixed result <BRK>day before the draft  johnson shed the costly contract of timofey mozgov giving up on d angelo russell  whom the team had selected second over all just two year earlier  in return for the duo  the brooklyn net gave up brook lopez and the  th pick in the draft  which turned into the promising kyle kuzma  but russell ha blossomed this year with the net  earning an all star appearance while leading brooklyn back to the playoff <BRK>russell s departure opened the point guard spot for lonzo ball  who ha flahed two way potential but largely fallen short of his lofty expectation a the second pick in the draft  in addition to kuzma  the lakers struck gold with josh hart  who wa selected  th and ha become a core piece <BRK>johnson made no secret of his intent to draw the game s biggest star to los angeles  with an eye toward what wa expected to be a major   off season  the team largely punted on the   off season to preserve it salary cap space in    signing kentavious caldwell pope to a one year deal <BRK>at the   trade deadline  the lakers shed the contract of jordan clarkson and larry nance jr   opening more cap space  johnson said the trade indicated the lakers would have the cap space and the ability to land two star player  either trade or free agency <BRK> i wouldn t have made the move if i wasn t confident   he said at the time <BRK>signing lebron james to a long term contract in   wa exactly the kind of result the lakers had planned for and needed  setting expectation that they would return to the playoff and compete for a championship  but the free agent the lakers signed to surround him   caldwell pope  rajon rondo  lance stephenson  javale mcgee and michael beasley   immediately puzzled some observer <BRK>an optimist would have called them playoff tested veteran  others saw it differently  a cast of nonshooters and big personality who would have a questionable fit next to james and the lakers  young talent <BRK>the hodgepodge crew wa assembled partly because the team struck out on it bigger target  after year of speculation that paul george would return to his hometown  he instead opted to re sign with oklahoma city  the san antonio spur sent kawhi leonard east to the toronto raptor  demarcus cousin signed a bargain  one year deal with the golden state warrior <BRK>once the season arrived  the lakers blew it in dramatic fashion  extending their record playoff drought  but they preserved cap space for the   off season  giving them another chance to add a star <BRK>there could be little doubt the lakers would be interested in anthony davis a soon a he became available  james and davis share an agent  and the lakers were long believed to be davis s most committed suitor <BRK>but when the all star center made a public trade request in late january  he created a debacle for johnson and the lakers  the player in the lakers  young core   ball  kuzma  hart and brandon ingram  the second overall pick from the   draft   were constantly named in leaked trade offer <BRK>the pelican made an effort to head off any potential tampering when they announced davis s trade request   we have also requested the league to strictly enforce the tampering rule associated with this transaction   the team said in a statement <BRK>in addition to davis s connection to the lakers  los angeles had a well known history of tampering  dating back to johnson s tweet before he took over <BRK>johnson wa not very subtle about recruiting george during a   appearance on  jimmy kimmel live   during which he wa asked what he would do if he saw the player socially <BRK> we re going to say hi because we know each other  you just can t say   hey  i want you to come to the lakers   even though i ll be wink winking like   you know what that mean  right    <BRK>the episode earned johnson a warning from the n b a   and the team wa later fined      for what the league deemed impermissible contact between pelinka and george s agent <BRK>in june    johnson wa fined      for his comment about giannis antetokounmpo after praising the buck star <BRK>in february  the sixer  ben simmons   who play a an oversize point guard  like johnson did   requested a meeting with johnson to get playing tip  prompting johnson to publicly praise the former rookie of the year  but the league ultimately determined johnson had not broken tampering rule <BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK>
