<BRK><BRK>james and antetokounmpo will pick from a pool of   player for this year s n b a  all star game  to get them started  we did a mock version of the draft  <BRK>by benjamin hoffman and scott cacciola<BRK>lebron james and giannis antetokounmpo will have their work cut out for them when they make their pick a captain in just the second n b a  all star draft   and the first to be televised  the tak is their prize for receiving the most vote in their conference   james in the west  and antetokounmpo in the eat   during all star balloting from fan  medium and player <BRK>to help them out  we stepped in a captain for a mock draft in our bid to build the perfect team  we have aked marc stein  our venerable n b a  reporter and columnist  to weigh in on which of u came away with a winner <BRK>the rule are the same a those that will be employed on thursday <BRK>each team must first select a starting lineup from the eight other starter a selected the fan  medium and player  <BRK>the    nbaallstar starter    lebronjames  giannisantetokounmpo  joelembiid  kyrieirving  kembawalker stephencurry  jamesharden  paulgeorge  kevindurant kawhileonard pic twitter com aycxldckg <BRK>the second round will feature the   reserve  and the third round will feature the game s two veteran ambassador  dirk nowitzki of the dallas maverick and dwyane wade of the miami heat  <BRK>team lebron  scott cacciola  will pick first in the first and third round  and team giannis  benjamin hoffman  will pick first among the reserve  <BRK>round one   starter<BRK>team lebron<BRK>cacciola  if i m channeling my inner lebron  i m rewarding harden for his ridiculous first half of the season making him the first pick  and i m going to expect him to take no fewer than   stepback  s from just inside half court <BRK>team giannis<BRK>hoffman  there are argument to be made for other player  but once you consider giannis s skill set  there is no one more complementary than curry  with the space created curry s outside shooting   he s actually gotten more bold with long   pointer  if you can believe it   the lane will be wide open for the dunk that will get giannis named the game s most valuable player <BRK>team lebron<BRK>cacciola  wait a second  ben  i didn t know we were treating this like an actual game with actual strategy  that change everything  or doe it  putting aside personal rivalry  with my second pick  i m taking kevin durant because he  too  is really good at basketball  i also want to reunite him with harden  his former teammate  and let them fight over the ball <BRK>team giannis<BRK>hoffman  i m not loving the size disparity so far   harden is officially only three inch taller than curry but is also somehow at least two foot taller than curry   so i ll take the biggest guy in the starter pool  but based on my stated goal of designing a team to get giannis the m v p  award  i would be careful about having these two on the floor together all that much unless we start to fall behind <BRK>team lebron<BRK>cacciola  i need a defensive stopper  while i acknowledge that a cae could be made for paul george a the league s top defender this seaon  is there any question that leonard will approach this game the same way he doe a mid march clah with the buck  the guy doe not turn off the intensity   ever  so i m having him guard all five guy at once  because i already know that no one else will even pretend to play defense <BRK>team giannis<BRK>hoffman  there s a legitimate argument that you have the best four player on the court so far  and despite my belief that my guy are perfect to play with each other  i m getting a little nervous  the obvious play here would be to counter the kawhi pick with george  but i want to avoid the lebron kyrie pairing because i ve seen how dangerous it can be <BRK>team lebron<BRK>cacciola  i m going with more size and more versatility with my final pick among the starter  and i think you re in trouble  ben  a quick aside  george ha been incredible for the thunder this season  and he look like a man playing with an untroubled conscience   and without the distraction of free agency and looming future decision  if you take a look at this current batch of all star  that make george something of a rare breed <BRK>team giannis<BRK>hoffman  o k   so i didn t actually have a choice to make here  but if there s going to be one guy left in a gym waiting to be picked  it s pretty good for it to be a guy who had a   point game earlier this season and who happens to be playing in his home arena  my team is small and fast so far  but over all there s a star power gap that i m going to have to make up for in the reserve  which i will do from the start stealing anthony davis  before actual lebron steal him from the actual pelican  <BRK>team lebron  james harden  kevin durant  kawhi leonard  paul george<BRK>team giannis  stephen curry  joel embiid  kyrie irving  kemba walker<BRK>round two   reserve<BRK>team giannis<BRK>team lebron<BRK>team giannis<BRK>hoffman  it s almost entirely a function of format  but a guy who will most likely finish second to harden in m v p  voting going with the  th pick is a little weird  jokic doe a lot of thing well  he s a passing savant  he s a good rebounder  he shoot better than you probably think and he provides some size without sacrificing the fluid ball movement i ll have to hope can be built through my starter <BRK>team lebron<BRK>team giannis<BRK>team lebron<BRK>cacciola  i m not exactly sure what it mean that westbrook is the  th overall pick in our mock draft  maybe it mean that the league is so rich with top tier talent that it s not even shocking that a former m v p  who is  again  averaging a triple double slipped to the middle of the second round  but here we are <BRK>team giannis<BRK>team lebron<BRK>team giannis<BRK>team lebron<BRK>team giannis<BRK>team lebron<BRK>team giannis<BRK>team lebron<BRK>round three   ambassador<BRK>team lebron<BRK>cacciola  this is the most obvious pick in the entire draft this side of anthony davis  wade and james go way back  well before the banana boat day  and wade ha already made it abundantly clear that james better pick him  with retirement around the bend for wade  the game will be full of nostalgia   not only for wade  but for the partnership he formed with james  and chris bosh  in miami when superstar conglomerate were still a novel concept <BRK>team giannis<BRK>hoffman  one of the greatest scorer in n b a  history  dirk can t really move around much  and other than getting in the game to launch a jumper or two he s not a lot of added value on the court  but off the court he s still one of the funniest player in the league  taking a look at team lebron  my bench may need some moment of levity in what could turn into an ugly game <BRK>can i mock your pick instead of treating this like an actual game with something a mainstream a a prediction  we are looking for free agency clue in thursday s draft   not baketball decision  i suppose i will go with team lebron cacciola over team giannis hoffman if i m forced to choose  but what we really want to know is  will lebron draft irving  and or davis  he always ha a down the road plan in mind <BRK>benjamin hoffman is a senior staff editor and regular contributor to the keeping score column in sport  he joined the
