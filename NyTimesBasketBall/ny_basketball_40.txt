cacciola<BRK>lebron jame and gianni antetokounmpo will have their work cut out for them when they make their pick as captain in just the second n b a  all star draft   and the first to be televis  the task is their prize for receiv the most vote in their confer   jame in the west  and antetokounmpo in the east   dure all star ballot from fan  media and player <BRK>to help them out  we step in as captain for a mock draft in our bid to build the perfect team  we have ask marc stein  our vener n b a  report and columnist  to weigh in on which of us came away with a winner <BRK>the rule are the same as those that will be employ on thursday <BRK>each team must first select a start lineup from the eight other starter as select the fan  media and player  <BRK>the    nbaallstar starter    lebronjam  giannisantetokounmpo  joelembiid  kyrieirv  kembawalk stephencurri  jamesharden  paulgeorg  kevindur kawhileonard pic twitter com aycxldckg <BRK>the second round will featur the   reserv  and the third round will featur the game s two veteran ambassador  dirk nowitzki of the dalla maverick and dwyan wade of the miami heat  <BRK>team lebron  scott cacciola  will pick first in the first and third round  and team gianni  benjamin hoffman  will pick first among the reserv  <BRK>round one   starter<BRK>team lebron<BRK>cacciola  if i m channel my inner lebron  i m reward harden for his ridicul first half of the season make him the first pick  and i m go to expect him to take no fewer than   stepback  s from just insid half court <BRK>team gianni<BRK>hoffman  there are argument to be made for other player  but onc you consid gianni s skill set  there is no one more complementari than curri  with the space creat curri s outsid shoot   he s actual gotten more bold with long   pointer  if you can believ it   the lane will be wide open for the dunk that will get gianni name the game s most valuabl player <BRK>team lebron<BRK>cacciola  wait a second  ben  i didn t know we were treat this like an actual game with actual strategi  that chang everyth  or doe it  put asid person rivalri  with my second pick  i m take kevin durant becaus he  too  is realli good at basketbal  i also want to reunit him with harden  his former teammat  and let them fight over the ball <BRK>team gianni<BRK>hoffman  i m not love the size dispar so far   harden is offici onli three inch taller than curri but is also somehow at least two feet taller than curri   so i ll take the biggest guy in the starter pool  but base on my state goal of design a team to get gianni the m v p  award  i would be care about have these two on the floor togeth all that much unless we start to fall behind <BRK>team lebron<BRK>cacciola  i need a defens stopper  while i acknowledg that a case could be made for paul georg as the leagu s top defend this season  is there ani question that leonard will approach this game the same way he doe a mid march clash with the buck  the guy doe not turn off the intens   ever  so i m have him guard all five guy at onc  becaus i alreadi know that no one els will even pretend to play defens <BRK>team gianni<BRK>hoffman  there s a legitim argument that you have the best four player on the court so far  and despit my belief that my guy are perfect to play with each other  i m get a littl nervous  the obvious play here would be to counter the kawhi pick with georg  but i want to avoid the lebron kyri pair becaus i ve seen how danger it can be <BRK>team lebron<BRK>cacciola  i m go with more size and more versatil with my final pick among the starter  and i think you re in troubl  ben  a quick asid  georg has been incred for the thunder this season  and he look like a man play with an untroubld conscienc   and without the distract of free agenc and loom futur decis  if you take a look at this current batch of all star  that make georg someth of a rare breed <BRK>team gianni<BRK>hoffman  o k   so i didn t actual have a choic to make here  but if there s go to be one guy left in a gym wait to be pick  it s pretti good for it to be a guy who had a   point game earlier this season and who happen to be play in his home arena  my team is small and fast so far  but over all there s a star power gap that i m go to have to make up for in the reserv  which i will do from the start steal anthoni davi  befor actual lebron steal him from the actual pelican  <BRK>team lebron  jame harden  kevin durant  kawhi leonard  paul georg<BRK>team gianni  stephen curri  joel embiid  kyri irv  kemba walker<BRK>round two   reserv<BRK>team gianni<BRK>team lebron<BRK>team gianni<BRK>hoffman  it s almost entir a function of format  but a guy who will most like finish second to harden in m v p  vote go with the  th pick is a littl weird  jokic doe a lot of thing well  he s a pass savant  he s a good rebound  he shoot better than you probabl think and he provid some size without sacrif the fluid ball movement i ll have to hope can be built through my starter <BRK>team lebron<BRK>team gianni<BRK>team lebron<BRK>cacciola  i m not exact sure what it mean that westbrook is the  th overal pick in our mock draft  mayb it mean that the leagu is so rich with top tier talent that it s not even shock that a former m v p  who is  again  averag a tripl doubl slip to the middl of the second round  but here we are <BRK>team gianni<BRK>team lebron<BRK>team gianni<BRK>team lebron<BRK>team gianni<BRK>team lebron<BRK>team gianni<BRK>team lebron<BRK>round three   ambassador<BRK>team lebron<BRK>cacciola  this is the most obvious pick in the entir draft this side of anthoni davi  wade and jame go way back  well befor the banana boat day  and wade has alreadi made it abund clear that jame better pick him  with retir around the bend for wade  the game will be full of nostalgia   not onli for wade  but for the partnership he form with jame  and chris bosh  in miami when superstar conglomer were still a novel concept <BRK>team gianni<BRK>hoffman  one of the greatest scorer in n b a  histori  dirk can t realli move around much  and other than get in the game to launch a jumper or two he s not a lot of ad valu on the court  but off the court he s still one of the funniest player in the leagu  take a look at team lebron  my bench may need some moment of leviti in what could turn into an ugli game <BRK>can i mock your pick instead of treat this like an actual game with someth as mainstream as a predict  we are look for free agenc clue in thursday s draft   not basketbal decis  i suppos i will go with team lebron cacciola over team gianni hoffman if i m forc to choos  but what we realli want to know is  will lebron draft irv  and or davi  he alway has a down the road plan in mind <BRK>benjamin hoffman is a senior staff editor and regular
