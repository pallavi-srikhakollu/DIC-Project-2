 <BRK>  <BRK> by marc stein <BRK>  want to read more from marc stein  sign up for his free  weekly n b a  newsletter clicking here   <BRK> four of the six best record in the n b a  belonged to eastern conference team through saturday night s play  <BRK> the golden state warrior  meanwhile  reached the   game midpoint of the schedule on a pedestrian  for them    win pace  <BRK> the first half of the regular seaon  in other word  ha defied most preseaon prognostication and requires special examination to properly sort out the   to   landscape  so it is an ideal time to reconvene what is known a the committee  of one  and share my team by team progress report in the form of n b a  power ranking  <BRK> the committee  a it ha since the     seaon  determines the order weighing what is happening in the present alongside each team s big picture outlook   with sprinkle of subjectivity and whimsy thrown in  <BRK> what used to be a weekly endeavor for me is only a once a seaon enterprise every january now  yet the goal  a always  is to provide a more up to date and detailed asessment than the standing do  <BRK>  record and statistic are current heading into sunday s game   <BRK>    toronto raptor       <BRK> the raptor were this season s first   win team  which is impressive when kawhi leonard and kyle lowry have been in uniform together only three time in toronto s last   game  the threat of the los angeles clipper signing leonard away in free agency is all too real for every basketball loving canadian  but the raptor may still assemble the best possible sale pitch  win the post lebron james eastern conference to get to the n b a  final and give leonard ample reason to stay  <BRK>    milwaukee buck       <BRK> giannis antetokounmpo supplanting james harden a the league s most valuable player  mike budenholzer emerging from the usual deep field to win n b a  coach of the year  milwaukee clinching the eat s no    seed heading into the playoff  any of those would have been fairly wild claim back in september  but suddenly they all seem possible halfway through the regular seaon schedule  the challenge now  milwaukee is just beginning the toughest two month of it schedule  <BRK>    golden state warrior       maybe the warrior do not inspire the fear they once did  maybe their defensive woe  having slipped to  th in defensive efficiency  are a sign of true vulnerability  or maybe  with demarcus cousin just day away from making his long awaited debut  golden state s season is about to start for real  i tend to believe it is the latter  in year   of a historic run  having seen firsthand how much this team can struggle with regular season motivation  <BRK>  read  demarcus cousin eye return a warrior prepare for   all star lineup  <BRK>    denver nugget       <BRK> the regular seaon is just under   day old  the plucky nugget  despite numerous injury  have held the top spot in the west   golden state s conference   for   of them  yet you would not know it given the limited attention these guy get  a n b a  know it alls wrestle with billing denver a a full fledged contender   or dismissing them a a team that can only do pre april damage  book this either way  nikola jokic is a lock to snag his first all star berth  <BRK>    oklahoma city       <BRK> remember the thunder s     start  neither do we  despite the seaon long absence of the ace defender andre roberson  oklahoma city lead the league in defensive rating  allowing just     point per   possession  and specializes in the physical style that ha troubled golden state in the pat  the thunder have undoubtedly benefited from what rank a the league s second eaiest schedule to date  but you would struggle to find a star duo meshing better than russell westbrook and paul george  <BRK>    houston rocket       <BRK> earlier this season  i responded to the rocket  disappointing start and chris paul s ongoing hamstring issue stopping just short of proclaiming the window to contention closed for james harden and co  houston is     since dec      with harden averaging a mere     point  and       point attempt   per game in that stretch  write the rocket off if you wish  but harden s brilliance  augmented a resurgent clint capela and the newcomer austin river  should give you pause  <BRK>    indiana pacer       <BRK> surprise no     only six team in the league  according to basketball reference com s projection  will finish the season with at least   win  surprise no     indiana is on that list  ahead of higher profile team like philadelphia and oklahoma city  despite the fact that the all star guard victor oladipo ha missed   game with a knee problem  coach nate mcmillan  continuity and a top two defense have the unfashionable pacer overachieving   again  <BRK>    san antonio spur       <BRK> this season s     start marked the first time gregg popovich ha ever sported a sub    record after   game and included a four game stretch in which the spur unfathomably suffered three loss in excess of   point  the ensuing turnaround  though  ha been no le remarkable  san antonio is     and rank no    in offensive efficiency and no    in defensive efficiency in that span  led the midrange maestro demar derozan and lamarcus aldridge flat out ignoring the league s   point revolution  <BRK>    boston celtic       <BRK> the number continue to say that the celtic are fine  they have a per game average point differential        that rank second only to milwaukee s         boston is also one of just four team  along with milwaukee  toronto and denver  to rank in the top   in both offensive  ninth  and defensive  fourth  efficiency  the problem  boston just followed up an impressive rout of indiana with loss in miami and orlando that suggested yet again that thing are not fine  <BRK>    philadelphia  er       <BRK> for all the creative tension that ha bubbled around the sixer since they acquired jimmy butler on nov     they have the fourth best overall record in that span       despite well chronicled concern about shooting and depth around philadelphia s star trio a well a the occaional squawking  butler s fit alongside joel embiid and ben simmons ha been le than seamle  a predicted  but stockpiling a much talent a possible and then trying to solve the puzzle is the n b a  way  <BRK>    utah jazz       <BRK> the jazz have risen to a more familiar no    in defensive efficiency and contend that their road heavy schedule  with   of the first   game away  ha contributed mightily to keeping them out of the west s top eight for much of the seaon  but to resemble the team most expert thought it would be  utah need donovan mitchell s january resurgence to lat  a well a a return to lat seaon s standard from joe ingles  <BRK>    portland trail blazer       <BRK> one of my faulty prediction from lat year aserted that   would be the year that the trail blazer finally broke up the damian lillard c j  mccollum partnership a a mean to build a more balanced roster  portland ha instead clung to the hope that jusuf nurkic will keep inching closer to becoming the consistent third wheel it ha needed for age  it is a better team than lat seaon s version but only marginally   and still vulnerable to athletic opposition  <BRK>    los angeles lakers       <BRK> winning without lebron james is hard  who knew  the lakers are     since james suffered a strained groin in a christma day rout of golden state  a a result  they have slid from a higher than expected no    to an uncomfortable no    in the west   thus resurrecting all the preseaon question about l a  s ability to make the playoff with  shall we say  such an eclectic roster  james appears likely  at    to miss more than the   game stephen curry lost to a similar injury in november  <BRK>    los angeles clipper       <BRK> i fear they are at high risk to slip out of the west s top eight  but the clipper would certainly slot in right at the top of the play hard ranking if there were such an industry  the feisty like of montrezl harrell and patrick beverley  flanking a better than ever tobias harris  continue to make the clipper more bizarrely competitive than anyone imagined heading into a summer in which they appear well positioned to make the loudest free agent noise in franchise history  <BRK>    sacramento king       <BRK> a bogdan bogdanovic buzzer beater to topple the lakers on dec    hiked the fat paced king  record to     and seemed to announce the blossoming tandem of de aaron fox and buddy hield a certifiable playoff material after a league high   consecutive seaons of missing out  sacramento then unraveled  enduring a     funk which included an embarrasing fall from ahead loss at phoenix when the sun were without devin booker  you cannot afford funk in the west  <BRK>    miami heat       <BRK> little emanating from south beach make sense  whether it is miami s ability to play    basketball despite missing out on butler via trade and having goran dragic healthy for just   game   or the fact this team is     against atlanta  it is unclear how long it will take miami to get back into the trade mix for a player of butler s caliber  but the retiring dwyane wade should have an opportunity to bid the game farewell from the playoff stage  <BRK>    brooklyn net       <BRK> the drop off from the eat s top five to team trying to secure the lat three playoff stop is a steep a pessimist feared  not that the net intend to apologize after the barren half decade they endured in the wake of their disatrous   trade with boston  while the knicks tank their way to a shot at zion williamson  new yorkers may get postseaon game after all  thanks to success story like spencer dinwiddie  d angelo russell  joe harris and jarrett allen  <BRK>    new orleans pelican       <BRK> it is a misnomer to say anthony davis ha no help  jrue holiday  nikola mirotic and julius randle are all accomplished player  the pelican  problem have been health  most notably injury for mirotic and the point guard elfrid payton  and difficulty in playing davis  mirotic and randle together even when they are all available  new orleans  a a result  is facing the biggest possible issue  scenario that force them to trade the brow grow more plausible the day  <BRK>    washington wizard       <BRK> indiana ha crashed the east s upper crust to give the conference it own fab five  but we were not exaggerating the drop off to the chaing pack  look no further than the nation s capital for proof  with the wizard still firmly in the playoff chae despite losing john wall to season ending heel surgery  recent win over oklahoma city  philadelphia and milwaukee should tell you that the wiz are not heeding some fan  call to tank  <BRK>    dallas maverick       <BRK> luka doncic ha a real shot to become the first rookie to achieve all star status since blake griffin in    which already make this a more successful season in dallas than many forecast  but the huge disparity between the maverick  play at home       and on the road        dirk nowitzki s health woe in what they hoped would be a heartwarming final season and j j  barea s season ending achilles tear  have combined to snuff out some of the joy  <BRK>  read  the maverick  key to keeping player fresh  blood sample  <BRK>    minnesota timberwolf       a regular reader know  glen taylor s pasive ownership style is a frequent source of consternation for the committee  but give taylor this  firing tom thibodeau when he did to replace him with the   year old ryan saunders  bizarre a the timing seemed  meant eating an estimated    million left on thibodeau s contract  if only taylor wa that decisive back in june or july when the wolf really needed to start dealing with butler s discontent  <BRK>    charlotte hornet       <BRK> the michael jordan owned hornet have all star weekend hosting duty in a month to assure the franchise and city a measure of prominence this season  but what they  especially jordan  really want is a playoff berth that is no mean certain given the limited scoring punch charlotte can field beyond it do everything guard kemba walker  it also doe not help that the hornet have already racked up a league high eight costly loss in one possession game  <BRK>    detroit piston       <BRK> since it hit my radar during an early seaon visit to motown  it ha been one of my favorite stats of the seaon  blake griffin lead the league in touch per game at      nikola jokic and harden are the only others in  s  but the number double a an illustration of the piston  shortcoming a much a it spotlight griffin s special ability a a power player to handle the ball like a guard  he is clearly compensating for multiple hole in the roster  <BRK>    memphis grizzly       <BRK> memphis ha nose dived from a west leading record of     on thanksgiving  losing   of   game while the former all star center marc gasol ha been submerged in a slump that ha shown few sign of relenting  the fade may not only cost the grizzly a playoff berth but also threaten to extend mike conley s career long wait for an all star berth  since team success is bound to be factored in to the vote of the medium panel and coach given the glut of worthy guard in the west  <BRK>    orlando magic       <BRK> the magic reeled off seven win in a nine game stretch in november under new coach steve clifford to spawn hope that competing for a spot in the inviting lower reach of the eat s playoff ladder wa feaible  two month later  apart from the career best seaon asembled the veteran big man nikola vucevic  orlando is back on course for a ninth successive trip to the lottery and remains a desperate a phoenix for an upgrade at point guard  <BRK>    atlanta hawk       <BRK> if the hawk finish where they are a the so called best of the worst  they will have a     percent shot at the no    overall pick in june in the n b a  s new lottery system  which flattens out the odds to   percent each for team with the three worst record  in the interim  trae young s development is the overwhelming focus  which make it difficult not to partake in obsessing over how young is shooting from the field      and   point range       <BRK>    phoenix sun       <BRK> deandre ayton s rookie of the year campaign would appear to be the only pleasant diversion for one of the league s longest suffering fan base amid phoenix s ninth straight non playoff season  booker s various health woe and the owner robert sarver s struggle to secure public financing for the renovation of the sun  downtown arena  yet i cannot say i love ayton s chance after witnessing up close how badly he wa outplayed the r o y  favorite doncic last week  <BRK>    new york knicks       <BRK> will the knicks really hold kristaps porzingis out for the entire season  will the knicks trade ene kanter  will the knicks get lucky in the june draft  those three question have dominated coach david fizdale s first season in new york while this franchise wait for it opportunity in july to see if it can really make the long awaited splash in free agency that many league observer legitimately expect after two mostly hapless decade  <BRK>    chicago bull       <BRK> jim boylen is still running some long practice  but thing have mellowed  at least somewhat  between the bull and their feisty new coach after the initial wave of wind sprint  push ups and disagreement  while boylen work to secure a return next season  it is all about development for the rest of this season for the few keeper on the roster   most notably lauri markkanen  zach lavine and wendell carter jr    and finding new home for jabari parker and robin lopez  <BRK>    cleveland cavalier       <BRK> in the four year between james s two stint with his home state franchise  cleveland somehow won the n b a  draft lottery three time     kyrie irving      anthony bennett  and    andrew wiggins   dream of getting lucky again and earning the right to select zion williamson may be the only source of comfort for cavalier fan to get through what surely must feel like the longest of winter watching such hopeless basketball  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
