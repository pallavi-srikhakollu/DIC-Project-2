<BRK><BRK>by marc stein<BRK>the text messag from his assist coach rex kalamian pop up on doc river s phone on an off night last week  but it contain no press strateg suggest for the los angel clipper  next game  no injuri updat or juici trade rumor  either <BRK>kalamian simpli felt an urgenc to let river know that it had happen again   anoth burst of the scoreboard overload that has domin this     n b a  season even more than the star laden golden state warrior <BRK>a laugh river recount how kalamian s summari point out that near everi winner that night  jan     score   to   point   it was like five team up there   river said <BRK>in truth it was onli four   indiana      atlanta      golden state     and philadelphia       but river s point was made  a leaguwid push team to shoot more   pointer and take more shot earlier in the shot clock than ever befor  combin with a freedom of movement crusad driven the leagu offic  has result in an offens boom render score in the  s routin   with few sign of it abat <BRK>the trend has not been met with univers approv  some of the game s biggest name  includ gregg popovich  charl barkley and stan van gundi  continu to regist concern that team are abandon too mani tradit offens principl in favor of rampant hoist  s <BRK>top defend like golden state s draymond green and denver s paul millsap have also charg that tighter refere has made it harder than ever to counter the offens wizardri of dynam new age scorer like houston s jame harden  who rumbl for   point wednesday night at madison squar garden to cap a five game streak in which harden averag a coloss     point <BRK>the review  though  have general been more posit than negat  the n b a  s   team are averag     point per game collect  up from     last season   repres the highest rate sinc      when it was a   team leagu that wasn t near as sophist in it defens concept and scout techniqu <BRK> the game is the most skill that i ve ever seen it   said river  who play in the n b a  from   to   and has been a head coach sinc     i like watch the game now  so i guess that s my answer  but it s a differ game  there s no doubt about it  <BRK>said millsap  who made four all star appear with atlanta befor join the nugget in juli     you can t realli touch guy now  so the foul are up    point shoot is definit up  and the score s up  <BRK>millsap  though  is not convinc that those thing are necessarili worrisom <BRK> it s fun for the fan to see   he said   it s fun to see good team get   point  so i m all for it  <BRK>as recent as three season ago  in      team manag to crack the   point barrier onli five time  that number rose to   last season  this season it has alreadi happen   time enter friday s play  which coincid with the leagu averag for   point attempt per game cross the   threshold for the first time in leagu histori at     <BRK>the leagu offic  howev  insist that inflat score further was not the aim when it announc that exist rule would be enforc with greater frequenc this season  the rule in question forbid player to  hold  push  charg into  imped the progress of an oppon   or take ani other measur that could be interpret as caus the player guard to be  rerout  <BRK>kiki vandewegh  the n b a  s execut vice presid for basketbal oper  said the push to enforc such violat with more vigil stem from longstand team complaint about physic away from the ball and in the post in an era when more and more coach have favor switch defens that call for defend to pass player off to a nearbi teammat instead of tri to fight through screen <BRK> those rule were alway there   vandewegh said <BRK>the freedom of movement movement gain steam last summer when coach like boston s brad steven and utah s quin snyder led the lobbi against the prolifer of switch defens creat too mani opportun  in vandewegh s word  for  hold and grab and physic play off the ball  <BRK>yet that s just one element of a cocktail that has chang the offens equat as wild as the n b a  wit in the     season  when the pair of steve nash and coach mike d antoni s fame seven second or less offens   abet the leagu s crackdown on hand check   began to revolution offens philosophi  the campaign to curtail physic play was among the factor that help transform nash from a mere all star point guard to a two time winner of the most valuabl player award <BRK>the warrior  led their splash brother backcourt of stephen curri and klay thompson  then took d antoni s freewheel approach to a new level in their first championship season in     averag       pointer and a leagu high     possess per   minut <BRK>the rocket  now coach d antoni  have sinc made golden state look compar restrain  averag       point shot per game last season and     per game this season  houston s devot to   pointer and layup  and prefer noth in between  at the behest of their analyt obsess general manag  daryl morey  is such that harden   co  are attempt more   pointer than   pointer as a team for the second consecut season <BRK>enter friday s game    team were averag at least     pointer per game  while pace is anoth area that has revv thing up dramat  team are averag     possess per   minut this season  which is onli     possess more than last season  but consid that the sun  highest pace averag in nash s peak year      possess per   minut in      would rank  th this season <BRK> my first year here  we were no    in the leagu in pace and it felt like we were run past everibodi everi night   golden state coach steve kerr said   this year i think we re play even faster than we did in      but we re middl of the pack  the whole leagu has shift in term of prioriti and style  <BRK>vandewegh is convinc that when the competit committe reconven next month dure all star weekend in charlott to assess how the game is be play and offici  there will be more prais than grumbl <BRK> i still remain the complaint depart   vandewegh said   but most of the feedback i get is   the game look better    <BRK>kerr is among the frequent objector despit the fact his team seem benefit as much as ani from a free flow game  he contend offens player are not punish enough on travel call and when push off on drive to the basket  which fuel kerr s content that it has  never been more difficult to guard in the n b a  than it is right now  <BRK> i d like to see a balanc where the rule are still gear toward these high score  becaus i think a lot of peopl enjoy that  but you ve got to give the defens a chanc   kerr said   we re give so much of an advantag to the offens player  <BRK>propon of the   pointer laud it comeback potenc  in term of wipe out big deficit quick  but there s no dodg the fact that blowout are on the rise  there have been   game alreadi this season decid   point or more   compar to just   total last season and a record   in     <BRK> i think a lot of peopl  mayb in the n b a  offic and some of the media  just equat score with excit   stan van gundi  the espn analyst and former miami  orlando and detroit coach  said on a recent nbc sport  habershow  podcast   close  competit game  regardless of style of play  are alway excit <BRK> i think we re head in the wrong direct  we re o k  right now  where are we go to be in five year  is everybodi go to shoot   or    s a game  <BRK>there has been no louder critic of the direct offens are trend than popovich  who routin use the word  bore  to describ the prolifer of shot behind the   point line  san antonio s       point attempt per game  which rank last in the leagu  would have rank no    as recent as the     season <BRK> everybodi penetr to shoot  s  so the art of the game is sort of get lost   popovich said last week   and everybodi doe the same thing becaus the analyt drive it  where shoot these  s seem to be the smart thing to do <BRK> so you end a game and the first stat you look at is if one team shot  s well and the other one didn t  game over   you don t have to look at rebound  turnov  anyth els  that tell the whole tale  and that s pretti bore  <BRK>popovich was then ask if the spur  leagu low total of   point attempt is strateg design  in respons to the lost  art   or more aproduct of san antonio s roster  which featur two elit midrang scorer in lamarcus aldridg and demar derozan but no point guard adept at get into the paint and collaps defens <BRK> if we were abl to get more  s   popovich admit grim   we would  <BRK>scott cacciola and victor mather contribut report <BRK><BRK>
