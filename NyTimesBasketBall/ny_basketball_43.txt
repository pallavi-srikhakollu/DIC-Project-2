<BRK><BRK>by marc stein<BRK>the text message from his assistant coach rex kalamian popped up on doc river s phone on an off night last week  but it contained no pressing strategic suggestion for the los angeles clipper  next game  no injury update or juicy trade rumor  either <BRK>kalamian simply felt an urgency to let river know that it had happened again   another burst of the scoreboard overload that ha dominated this     n b a  season even more than the star laden golden state warrior <BRK>a laughing river recounted how kalamian s summary pointed out that nearly every winner that night  jan     scored   to   point   it wa like five team up there   river said <BRK>in truth it wa only four   indiana      atlanta      golden state     and philadelphia       but river s point wa made  a leaguewide push team to shoot more   pointer and take more shot earlier in the shot clock than ever before  combined with a freedom of movement crusade driven the league office  ha resulted in an offensive boom rendering score in the  s routine   with few sign of it abating <BRK>the trend ha not been met with universal approval  some of the game s biggest name  including gregg popovich  charles barkley and stan van gundy  continue to register concern that team are abandoning too many traditional offensive principle in favor of rampantly hoisting  s <BRK>top defender like golden state s draymond green and denver s paul millsap have also charged that tighter refereeing ha made it harder than ever to counter the offensive wizardry of dynamic new age scorer like houston s james harden  who rumbled for   point wednesday night at madison square garden to cap a five game streak in which harden averaged a colossal     point <BRK>the review  though  have generally been more positive than negative  the n b a  s   team are averaging     point per game collectively  up from     lat seaon   representing the highest rate since      when it wa a   team league that wan t nearly a sophisticated in it defensive concept and scouting technique <BRK> the game is the most skilled that i ve ever seen it   said river  who played in the n b a  from   to   and ha been a head coach since     i like watching the game now  so i guess that s my answer  but it s a different game  there s no doubt about it  <BRK>said millsap  who made four all star appearance with atlanta before joining the nugget in july     you can t really touch guy now  so the foul are up    point shooting is definitely up  and the scoring s up  <BRK>millsap  though  is not convinced that those thing are necessarily worrisome <BRK> it s fun for the fan to see   he said   it s fun to see good team get   point  so i m all for it  <BRK>a recently a three seaons ago  in      team managed to crack the   point barrier only five time  that number rose to   lat seaon  this seaon it ha already happened   time entering friday s play  which coincides with the league average for   point attempt per game crossing the   threshold for the first time in league history at     <BRK>the league office  however  insists that inflating score further wa not the aim when it announced that existing rule would be enforced with greater frequency this seaon  the rule in question forbid player to  hold  push  charge into  impede the progress of an opponent   or take any other meaure that could be interpreted a causing the player guarded to be  rerouted  <BRK>kiki vandeweghe  the n b a  s executive vice president for basketball operation  said the push to enforce such violation with more vigilance stemmed from longstanding team complaint about physicality away from the ball and in the post in an era when more and more coach have favored switching defense that call for defender to pas player off to a nearby teammate instead of trying to fight through screen <BRK> those rule were always there   vandeweghe said <BRK>the freedom of movement movement gained steam last summer when coach like boston s brad stevens and utah s quin snyder led the lobbying against the proliferation of switching defense creating too many opportunity  in vandeweghe s word  for  holding and grabbing and physical play off the ball  <BRK>yet that s just one element of a cocktail that ha changed the offensive equation a wildly a the n b a  witnessed in the     seaon  when the pairing of steve nah and coach mike d antoni s famed seven second or le offense   abetted the league s crackdown on hand checking   began to revolutionize offensive philosophy  the campaign to curtail physical play wa among the factor that helped transform nah from a mere all star point guard to a two time winner of the most valuable player award <BRK>the warrior  led their splash brother backcourt of stephen curry and klay thompson  then took d antoni s freewheeling approach to a new level in their first championship season in     averaging       pointer and a league high     possession per   minute <BRK>the rocket  now coached d antoni  have since made golden state look comparatively restrained  averaging       point shot per game lat seaon and     per game this seaon  houston s devotion to   pointer and layup  and preferably nothing in between  at the behest of their analytics obsessed general manager  daryl morey  is such that harden   co  are attempting more   pointer than   pointer a a team for the second consecutive seaon <BRK>entering friday s game    team were averaging at least     pointer per game  while pace is another area that ha revved thing up dramatically  team are averaging     possession per   minute this season  which is only     possession more than last season  but consider that the sun  highest pace average in nash s peak year      possession per   minute in      would rank  th this season <BRK> my first year here  we were no    in the league in pace and it felt like we were running past everybody every night   golden state coach steve kerr said   this year i think we re playing even faster than we did in      but we re middle of the pack  the whole league ha shifted in term of priority and style  <BRK>vandeweghe is convinced that when the competition committee reconvenes next month during all star weekend in charlotte to ass how the game is being played and officiated  there will be more praise than grumble <BRK> i still remain the complaint department   vandeweghe said   but most of the feedback i get is   the game look better    <BRK>kerr is among the frequent objector despite the fact his team seemingly benefit a much a any from a free flowing game  he contends offensive player are not punished enough on traveling call and when pushing off on drive to the baket  which fuel kerr s contention that it ha  never been more difficult to guard in the n b a  than it is right now  <BRK> i d like to see a balance where the rule are still geared toward these high score  because i think a lot of people enjoy that  but you ve got to give the defense a chance   kerr said   we re giving so much of an advantage to the offensive player  <BRK>proponent of the   pointer laud it comeback potency  in term of wiping out big deficit quickly  but there s no dodging the fact that blowout are on the rise  there have been   game already this season decided   point or more   compared to just   total last season and a record   in     <BRK> i think a lot of people  maybe in the n b a  office and some of the medium  just equate scoring with excitement   stan van gundy  the espn analyst and former miami  orlando and detroit coach  said on a recent nbc sport  habershow  podcast   close  competitive game  regardless of style of play  are always exciting <BRK> i think we re headed in the wrong direction  we re o k  right now  where are we going to be in five year  is everybody going to shoot   or    s a game  <BRK>there ha been no louder critic of the direction offense are trending than popovich  who routinely us the word  boring  to describe the proliferation of shot behind the   point line  san antonio s       point attempt per game  which ranked lat in the league  would have ranked no    a recently a the     seaon <BRK> everybody penetrates to shoot  s  so the artfulness of the game is sort of getting lost   popovich said last week   and everybody doe the same thing because the analytics drive it  where shooting these  s seems to be the smart thing to do <BRK> so you end a game and the first stat you look at is if one team shot  s well and the other one didn t  game over   you don t have to look at rebound  turnover  anything else  that tell the whole tale  and that s pretty boring  <BRK>popovich wa then asked if the spur  league low total of   point attempt is strategic design  in response to the lost  artfulness   or more aproduct of san antonio s roster  which feature two elite midrange scorer in lamarcus aldridge and demar derozan but no point guard adept at getting into the paint and collapsing defense <BRK> if we were able to get more  s   popovich admitted grimly   we would  <BRK>scott cacciola and victor mather contributed reporting <BRK><BRK>
