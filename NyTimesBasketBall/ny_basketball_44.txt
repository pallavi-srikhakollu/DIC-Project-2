i think the shift i ve seen   coach billi donovan said   is a guy who s a lot more comfort  <BRK>georg has been limit recent shoulder sore  and oklahoma citi has slip a bit in the stand  but the thunder are capabl of be a forc in the playoff  and they appear to be a close knit group  one reason  oklahoma citi is not exact flush with  extracurricular   as georg put it  so the player tend to linger at the practic facil  they spend a lot of time togeth  which has help build chemistri <BRK> and if one person has to go do someth  there s alway someon els who s like   i ll tag along with you    georg said   that s kind of been the cultur here  <BRK>georg was trade to the thunder befor the start of last season  after he told the indiana pacer that he would not sign a contract extens  most figur that oklahoma citi would be a pit stop for georg  who grew up in palmdal  calif   about   mile north of los angel  more to the point  he had told the pacer that he want to be ship to the laker <BRK>indiana balk and instead dealt him to oklahoma citi  where georg averag     point and     rebound last season  after oklahoma citi lost in the first round of the playoff  georg was a free agent  he could have gone near anywher  includ to the laker <BRK> i had so mani phone call and peopl ask me what he would do when it was all still up in the air   tom hegr  his former coach at knight high school  said in a telephon interview   but i person felt that he would stay with the thunder  i just didn t think he would bail on someth befor he gave it a legitim chanc  <BRK>hegr also said he suspect that oklahoma citi itself had someth to do with georg s decis  even now  after six all star appear  georg is a small town guy and a self describ  homebodi  <BRK>back in his high school day  georg and his father would occasion ask hegr if the team was plan to practic over the weekend  hegr knew that meant they were think about go fish  they had their favorit spot  hugh lake  lake elsinor  lopez lake  littl rock reservoir <BRK> i alway thought that was pretti cool   hegr said <BRK>georg has never play in a major market  not in high school  palmdal   not in colleg  fresno state   and not in the n b a   which may not be a coincid  when he was with the pacer  georg live in a suburban communiti with a larg lake  where he kept a boat  he fish there  too <BRK>at the same time  his exit from indiana affect him  it was the first time he felt dislik the mass  and he was someon who had alway tri hard to avoid disappoint or hurt peopl  said steve cleveland  his former coach at fresno state <BRK>when georg told cleveland that he was enter the n b a  draft after two season at fresno state  he was apologet   and so were his parent  who kept apolog even after georg began to star for the pacer <BRK> i had to say   stop it    cleveland said   but that s the type of peopl they are  <BRK>he ad   i ve never realli ask him this  but i m sure leav indiana was a pretti sensit deal for him  and i don t think he want to go through all that stress again  <BRK>it is not hard to find big time player who have come unglu at time becaus of their impend free agenc  kevin durant of the
