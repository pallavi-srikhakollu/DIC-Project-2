<BRK><BRK>by scott cacciola<BRK>paul george ha a small freshwater pond behind his house in oklahoma city that he stock with bas  crappie and bluegill  whenever he ha a couple of hour to spare from his responsibility a a do everything forward for the n b a  s thunder  he head out back with his fishing rod  he releaes what he catch   for now  anyway <BRK> waiting for them to get a little bigger   he said <BRK>george ha time  last summer  on the first night of free agency  he agreed to re sign with the thunder on a four year     million deal  the news emanated from a house party that russell westbrook  his superstar teammate  wa hosting for george  who did not even entertain meeting with rival team  he wa sticking with the thunder <BRK>in doing so  george made clear that he wa banking on his partnership with westbrook while offering endorsement of the organization and of oklahoma city s leisurely pace  he can fish  he can raise his two young child in a quiet neighborhood  and he can focus on basketball  knowing that his future is with the thunder <BRK> you can give your everything to one organization  and you know the direction that you re going   george said in a recent interview   there s so much that player have to deal with that i don t think people quite recognize  a lot of them are the same issue that everybody else deal with  but this take a lot of the burden off my shoulder  <BRK>there is something to be said for  relatively  stress free living  a several other star careen toward free agency this summer   and grapple with the accompanying distraction with varying degree of success   george     ha been playing the best baketball of his life <BRK>he is averaging     point      rebound and     assist  all career high  while shooting   percent from the field and     percent from   point range  he is at least in the conversation for his first n b a  most valuable player award <BRK> i think the shift i ve seen   coach billy donovan said   is a guy who s a lot more comfortable  <BRK>george ha been limited recently shoulder soreness  and oklahoma city ha slipped a bit in the standing  but the thunder are capable of being a force in the playoff  and they appear to be a close knit group  one reaon  oklahoma city is not exactly flush with  extracurriculars   a george put it  so the player tend to linger at the practice facility  they spend a lot of time together  which ha helped build chemistry <BRK> and if one person ha to go do something  there s always someone else who s like   i ll tag along with you    george said   that s kind of been the culture here  <BRK>george wa traded to the thunder before the start of last season  after he told the indiana pacer that he would not sign a contract extension  most figured that oklahoma city would be a pit stop for george  who grew up in palmdale  calif   about   mile north of los angeles  more to the point  he had told the pacer that he wanted to be shipped to the lakers <BRK>indiana balked and instead dealt him to oklahoma city  where george averaged     point and     rebound last season  after oklahoma city lost in the first round of the playoff  george wa a free agent  he could have gone nearly anywhere  including to the lakers <BRK> i had so many phone call and people asking me what he would do when it wa all still up in the air   tom hegre  his former coach at knight high school  said in a telephone interview   but i personally felt that he would stay with the thunder  i just didn t think he would bail on something before he gave it a legitimate chance  <BRK>hegre also said he suspected that oklahoma city itself had something to do with george s decision  even now  after six all star appearance  george is a small town guy and a self described  homebody  <BRK>back in his high school day  george and his father would occasionally ask hegre if the team wa planning to practice over the weekend  hegre knew that meant they were thinking about going fishing  they had their favorite spot  hughes lake  lake elsinore  lopez lake  little rock reservoir <BRK> i always thought that wa pretty cool   hegre said <BRK>george ha never played in a major market  not in high school  palmdale   not in college  fresno state   and not in the n b a   which may not be a coincidence  when he wa with the pacer  george lived in a suburban community with a large lake  where he kept a boat  he fished there  too <BRK>at the same time  his exit from indiana affected him  it wa the first time he felt disliked the mass  and he wa someone who had always tried hard to avoid disappointing or hurting people  said steve cleveland  his former coach at fresno state <BRK>when george told cleveland that he wa entering the n b a  draft after two season at fresno state  he wa apologetic   and so were his parent  who kept apologizing even after george began to star for the pacer <BRK> i had to say   stop it    cleveland said   but that s the type of people they are  <BRK>he added   i ve never really asked him this  but i m sure leaving indiana wa a pretty sensitive deal for him  and i don t think he wanted to go through all that stress again  <BRK>it is not hard to find big time player who have come unglued at time because of their impending free agency  kevin durant of the golden state warrior boycotted the news medium for a couple of week  kyrie irving of the boston celtic ha complained about the steep price of celebrity  for his part  george blamed  the press  for being a disruptive force in locker room <BRK> everything get blown up   he said   everything is a big deal  <BRK>it is no small feat  then  that george ha found a home with the thunder   and calm water in oklahoma city <BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK>
