 <BRK>  <BRK> by kelly whiteside <BRK> a net guard joe harris walk the cobblestone street outside the team s practice facility in sunset park  no one seems to notice  <BRK>  most of the time  i blend in   he said   i kind of look like i work in a brooklyn coffee shop   <BRK> harris s journey from unemployed castoff to indispensable starter mirror the rise of the net  a team reconstructed through savvy draft pick and second chance signing  without a marquee star  the net have won   of their last   game  and they are on a six game winning streak against opponent in the stronger western conference  <BRK> the net had   victory last season  now  despite a loss in boston on monday  they have the sixth best record in the eastern conference        and playoff talk is brewing  the injury riddled team ha weathered the loss of caris levert  out with a foot injury since november  and now is without spencer dinwiddie  a strong candidate for the sixth man of the year award  who may be out until mid march with a thumb injury  in dinwiddie s absence  the next man up net will look to g league call ups and increased scoring from everyone  <BRK>  i almost look at joe a one of the poster boy for the brooklyn net   the veteran demarre carroll said   he came in  wan t really guaranteed his first year  got on the team  worked his butt off  each year  he s gotten better  his number  his play  his confidence prof it   <BRK> three year ago  harris  then with the cleveland cavalier  had the worst day of his basketball life  in a period of a few hour  he had foot surgery  wa traded to orlando and wa immediately waived  he wa out of the league for six month before the net signed him to a minimum contract for le than    million in    last summer  he signed a two year     million deal to remain with the net  <BRK>  his story is about opportunity and development on a team starting to improve   coach kenny atkinson said   given where he came from  it s a romantic story  a beautiful story  everything about him   his humility  the fact that he ride the subway everywhere   is why everybody love joe   <BRK> harris s romance with the game began in chelan  wash   where his father coached high school basketball  in fourth grade  harris came home one afternoon and asked his mother if he could write his basketball goal on his bedroom wall  she assumed he would scribble them on paper and tape them up  instead  he took a marker and wrote directly on the wall and ceiling  the writing remain in his childhood bedroom  frozen in the amber of a   year old s penmanship  <BRK> given that chelan is a small town with only two gym  the worst time of the year wa when the court were being refinished  leaving harris nowhere to play  one time after an interminable wait  a   year old harris ran onto the court  slid on his stomach and kissed the floor   baby  i m back   he screamed  <BRK>  that pretty much sum me up a a kid   harris said   i just love baketball   <BRK> to the right of his childhood bed is his favorite quotation from john wooden  which he easily recites from memory   success is a peace of mind which is a direct result of self satisfaction in knowing that you did your best to become the best you are capable of becoming   <BRK> there are also line from charles barkley  julius erving  kareem abdul jabbar  larry bird and others  a well a a list of goal  the lat goal on the list   become a pro   <BRK> after playing four year at virginia  harris wa drafted in the second round cleveland in    he played sparingly for two season on the lebron james led cavalier  a few month after he wa released  he watched cleveland win it first n b a  title  <BRK> this season  harris wa averaging     point a game through sunday and had the third best   point shooting percentage in the n b a       percent   among player with at least   field goal attempt this season  he wa eighth at     in effective field goal percentage  trailing only golden state s stephen curry       among guard and wing player  according to basketball reference com  <BRK>  we want him to shoot more bad shot because he s such a great shooter  but he won t because he s such a good guy   atkinson said  <BRK> the pace and space era of the n b a  ha made a player like harris  a sharpshooter who creates space on the floor and strike when opportunity arises  more valuable  <BRK>  the game ha slowed down for him   atkinson said   his first two year he wa making turnover  not reading situation right  he used to be a defensive liability  and now we put him sometimes on the best shooter  <BRK>  i m pleased that he s played beyond his contract  for a guy who wasn t even in the league  he became a stalwart  a guy you can count on   <BRK> casual sport fan may struggle to name a player on the net  particularly one who is a regular   well  joe  the team shot an amusing video spoofing harris s accuracy in hope of earning him a spot in the all star   point shooting contest  <BRK> harris visited spot around brooklyn   he tossed orange into a shopping cart  lofted egg into a hot frying pan and shot some coin into a tip jar  <BRK>  joey bucket  he deserves to be in the contest   carroll said when asked about his teammate  throughout game  harris is serenaded    jo ey buck ets    the superfans in the brooklyn brigade section of barclays center  it s one of many nickname  others include lumber joe and beef jerky joe  <BRK> beef jerky joe   like the sasquatch from the commercial   harris said with a laugh  <BRK> though harris ha blended into brooklyn  in truth he is an accidental hipster  on a walk to the food hall at the industry city development in sunset park  he wa wearing black because it just happens to be the net  team color  his slightly slouchy knit cap wa pulled low to fight the chilly gust from the brooklyn waterfront  the lumberjack beard wa a remnant of a no shave off season  <BRK> every net player except jared dudley life in brooklyn  a throwback to when the dodger were brooklyn s team and the player raised their child in the borough and car pooled to ebbets field  <BRK> harris walk to barclays center on game day  after practice  atkinson frequently see him with his backpack  headed to the subway  <BRK>  he signed a big contract  you d think he d get a car service   atkinson said   but that s him  and that s u  we ve had a little success  but we re still humble   <BRK> in the food hall  there s everything a local might expect  like korean comfort food and an all avocado restaurant  harris stopped for a cup of   well  you know  not a nitro  cold brew or pour over  mind you  <BRK>  how do you like it   the barista asked harris  <BRK>  black   he said  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
