 <BRK>  <BRK> in two week  the n c a a  s primary legislative body  the division i council  will vote on a measure that could severely restrict graduate transfer  <BRK> by billy witz <BRK> minneapolis   when matt mooney wa refurbishing used baketball shoe and selling them out of the trunk of his car in high school  that entrepreneurial streak looked a if it would carry him further than baketball  at the time  he had only one division i scholarship offer  <BRK> when tariq owen wa at a renowned prep school  a a bouncy  loose limbed  four star recruit  an n b a  career seemed le like a pipe dream than a reaonable career path  college would serve a finishing school  <BRK> but several year  and university  later  there they were lat weekend in anaheim  calif   with fist clenched and arm raised triumphantly overhead  a unlikely teammate   and improbable one seaon catalyst   in helping texa tech reach the final four for the first time  <BRK> mooney and owen arrived at texa tech le than a year ago a a le heralded type of one and done player  having taken advantage of the n c a a  s graduate transfer rule  which allows athlete who have earned a degree and have eligibility remaining to switch college without having to sit out a year  <BRK> the graduate transfer rule  the rare n c a a  regulation that give leverage to the athlete  ha been used hundred of player since it wa relaxed in    and at a moment when athletic admission graft  shoe company payola and question about whether a transcendent  and unpaid  figure like zion williamson should even risk playing college baketball at all  the graduate transfer rule cat the beleaguered n c a a  a reaonable and almost munificent  <BRK> it is also a rule that may not last much longer  <BRK> in two week  the n c a a  s primary legislative body  the division i council  will vote on a measure that could severely restrict graduate transfer  the proposed rule change would require that college accepting graduate transfer be docked a scholarship the next year if the transfer doe not earn his secondary degree within a year  <BRK> so a graduate transfer have continued to increae   there were   this seaon in men s baketball  according to the website gradtransfertracker  including a handful who were key contributor on n c a a  tournament team   and a program have found value in them a a quick fix that suit both team and player  the new rule is seeking to discourage them effectively adding a tax on program that accept such player  <BRK>  that s really draconian   rodney fort  a sport economist and professor of sport management at the university of michigan  said of the rule change   this is like losing a scholarship from an n c a a  penalty   <BRK> the proposal  which could go into effect a soon a aug     would apply to only three sport   football  woman s baketball and men s baketball   but appears particularly aimed at men s baketball  football team  with   scholarship  are far more capable of coping with the loss of a single scholarship than a men s baketball squad  which ha    and there are roughly twice a many graduate transfer each year in men s baketball a in woman s baketball  <BRK> justin sell  the athletic director at south dakota state who led the division i transfer working group that developed the proposal  said that too often graduate transfer in men s basketball and football had little interest in obtaining graduate degree  <BRK>  we really want to protect against the football player who is done and leaf in december and the basketball player who is done and leaf in march   sell said   a lot of student are looking to use it to play another year  who s seriously there for the master s   <BRK> sell said that the committee surveyed athletic director  faculty representative  senior woman administrator  coach and athlete over   month  still  the fingerprint of baketball coach in the working group s recommendation were not hard to miss  the lone men s baketball voice on the committee wa st  joseph s coach phil martelli  who in a widely publicized   cae blocked one of his graduating player from transferring refusing to sign a releae  partially a a result of that cae  releaes are no longer required   martelli  who wa fired st  joseph s lat month  declined to comment through a university spokesman   <BRK> the rule itelf seems to have come straight from the mouth of kentucky coach john calipari  who suggested to espn in     long before the committee began it work   that  if the kid get his grad degree in one year  fine  if he doesn t  you ve got to use the scholarship for two year   <BRK> sell conceded objection about practicality  many graduate program take two year to complete  and fairness  the rule doe not apply to athlete who compete a graduate student without transferring  were fair  but said his group s intent wa to  manage behavior   <BRK>  when you re trying to manage behavior and put together policy and rule in trying to create ethical behavior and integrity  there are challenge to that   sell said   it s really hard to police integrity   <BRK> but the rule change leaf no room to ass the motivation of player who  degree in hand  seek new horizon with their remaining eligibility  the ivy league  for example  doe not allow it team to play graduate student  that led the former yale guard makai mason   who had missed his junior season with a broken foot   to help baylor to the n c a a  tournament this spring  the rule also gave the former stanford player reid travis the opening he needed to take his n b a  hope  and his final year of eligibility  to kentucky for some postgraduate basketball education  <BRK> geno crandall  who had begun his college career at north dakota  ended it a a reserve guard at gonzaga this spring  <BRK>  i kind of wanted a different experience   said crandall  who said he had sought out mooney  whom he had met when mooney wa at south dakota  for advice on the transfer process  crandall is working toward a master s degree in organizational leadership at gonzaga but said he took a lighter course load  two class per semester  so that he could focus on basketball  <BRK>  honestly  i m actually enjoying it a lot more than i did undergrad   crandall said before the zag lost to mooney s red raider in the west region final last weekend   there s a lot more discussion that go into it  a lot more adult feel  this is more tailored to what you find interesting   <BRK> gonzaga s crandall said he wa only vaguely aware of the proposed restriction on graduate transfer  but he did not like the idea that a rule change might deny future player the path he had chosen  <BRK>  whether it s good or bad  the n c a a  try to take a lot of control away from player   he said   you commit to a school and they tell you they want you to play and help you get your degree  so i feel like once you get your degree your obligation are kind of fulfilled   <BRK> nearly   percent of division i men s basketball player who arrive from high school will transfer the end of their sophomore year  according to n c a a  data from   to    owen and mooney  now in the final four  were in that group  <BRK> owen left tennessee after his freshman year when it coach wa fired  he transferred to st  john s  where he earned a degree in sport management  mooney left air force  unhappy with the military lifestyle  for south dakota  where he got a degree in innovation and entrepreneurship  he wa content to remain there for his final year until his coach  craig smith  left for utah state last april  <BRK> with eligibility left because of their transfer  owen and mooney hit the graduate transfer market seeking the same thing   a place where they could win  neither had been to the n c a a  tournament  and burnish their skill for a possible pro career  texas tech turned out to be a perfect match  a program on the rise with a respected coach  chris beard  and a roster that wa a perfect fit for owen  a   foot   shot blocker and finisher  and mooney  a ball hawking point guard who could find his shot  <BRK>  this is an environment where i knew i d be able to work and i d be coached hard   owen said   i like being in environment where you ve got something to prove   <BRK> at texas tech  owen     and mooney     are enrolled in a master s program for interdisciplinary study  taking three class in the fall and spring that are tailored to their interest  mooney is taking two of his class online  <BRK>  my primary focus is basketball  to try to set myself up for the pro   said mooney  who is studying educational leadership   academic aren t a huge priority right now  but you ve still got to take care of it  i ve got my degree   that s what s most important   <BRK> he added   i didn t leave place because i wasn t satisfied with playing time or thing like that  i definitely didn t want it to go this way  i didn t want to go to three different school  i wanted to go to one school  play there four year  have a great career and have a home to go back to and graduate  but sometimes life doesn t work out that way   <BRK> an earlier version of this article misidentified the university at which geno crandall began his college basketball career  it wa north dakota  not north dakota state  <BRK>  <BRK>
