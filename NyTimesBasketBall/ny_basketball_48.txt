point from howard  for his team to continue to advance  howard  who on wednesday wa named the big east s player of the year  will need to keep making his assortment of fallback jumper    pointer and twisting drive to the basket  that is the basketball burden howard  a   foot   junior guard  carry onto the court  but it is not why the image on the wall make him uncomfortable <BRK> a lot of what i want to be remembered for here at marquette is not for what i ve done on the court  but what i ve done off   howard said   i think my impact is made bigger when i do something for somebody else  <BRK>like talking about why he see a therapist <BRK>marquette  like many university  offer mental health service to student who request them  howard  unlike many college athlete  is eager to discus his experience <BRK>for about a year  he ha been seeing a licensed clinical social worker trained in psychotherapy  someone he and his family refer to a a sport psychologist  that suggests someone versed in the mental side of athletic performance <BRK>but howard said he sought help for balancing the daily demand of college life  managing clas work and outside interest with baketball  his weekly therapy session are continuing  he said  with more and more athlete publicly discussing their mental health struggle  from the olympian michael phelps and gracie gold to the n b a  star kevin love  howard said he felt he owed it to anyone reluctant to ak for help to lend his voice a well <BRK> a lot of people in my position wouldn t want to say anything   howard said   it s a duty of mine  to be in the position i m in  to be able to raise awareness of these kind of issue going on in our sport  i would be doing a disservice to the people around me and the people in the same situation a me if i didn t speak up  <BRK>that is not the only instance in which howard s leadership extends beyond basketball and his team  together with the lacrosse player nick singleton  howard founded a fellowship of christian athlete chapter on campus after they returned from a spring trip to build basketball court in costa rica with a group of marquette athlete  howard is also one of two student athlete on the   member n c a a  division i men s basketball oversight committee <BRK> given all the success that he ha  he still ha  to me  a servant s heart   coach steve wojciechowski said <BRK>three year ago

averaged     point and set marquette s single game scoring record    point  in an overtime victory at providence  after the game  friar coach ed cooley described howard a superman <BRK>but near the end of that season  with increasing attention on his play and marquette s  howard said he felt overwhelmed  his parent  chuck and noemi  sensed something wa wrong when they visited him for a game  so did wojciechowski and the golden eagle  staff  howard seemed quieter  more withdrawn <BRK>chuck howard  formerly the athletics performance director at grand canyon university in phoenix  figured marquette had mental health service available for athlete  the family discussed howard s engaging with them with the basketball staff <BRK> that wa something we felt like would be helpful for markus  having an outlet to talk to somebody about what he s feeling  thinking  and all the thing that are coming at him   wojciechowski said   we encouraged it  we encourage anything that is going to help our guy become better people  because better people make better player  <BRK>howard agreed <BRK> mainly  it s getting how thing away from the court impact me on the court   he said   we can see what might be causing a problem  then try to fix it to where it doesn t even come into contact when i do start playing  so i can have a free mind when i play <BRK> a a student athlete  you think your life revolves around the game  that s not the cae  i want to talk about all apects of life so i can grow in all apects of life  not just in my sport  i feel like if i m the best version of myself  i can give the best version of myself to other people  so i want to be able to do that on the court and off  <BRK>at time  chuck howard said  markus had to be prodded to go to session   now it s been a consistent thing for him   chuck howard said   it s really been helpful  and he felt led to speak about it  it s not something we pushed him to do or asked him to do  he just felt led because he saw the benefit of what it did for him  <BRK>until the last few game  howard ha been an even better version of the player he wa last year <BRK>howard broke his single game scoring record   and set a big east mark   with   point in a     overtime victory at creighton on jan     a game in which he made     pointer in   attempt  in game through monday  howard led the big east and ranked sixth nationally in division i in scoring  at   point a game  he wa making       pointer a game  also sixth best  and his     free throw percentage ranked ninth in the country <BRK>howard honed his shooting in intense summer session directed his older brother desmond  a former college player  their unconventional drill feature pull up jumper from a step inside half court  and arcing shot over folded bleacher

you just have to give him the ball and watch him work  work his magic  it s cool to see where he s grown and where he can still grow  <BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK>
