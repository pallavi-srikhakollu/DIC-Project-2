he had become  that guy   the player left wide open during pickup basketball  so he enlisted the help of his   year old son s coach  <BRK> creditcredit <BRK>  <BRK> by nik mittal <BRK> photograph and video jonah markowitz <BRK> i wa   year old when my parent   both graduate student from india   moved from married student housing to a little home in raleigh  n c   with a baketball hoop in the backyard  even a an immigrant from south aia  i knew what that hoop meant  <BRK> basketball is a religion in north carolina  and i quickly became a disciple  when i wa    the n c  state wolfpack won the n c a a  championship in heart stopping fashion  i still remember my dad taking me to the center of campus for the midnight celebration and being transfixed the sheer size and emotion of it  <BRK> my love for the game soon became an obsession  i taught myself to shoot in the backyard and played against the neighborhood kid  i learned to make up for my disadvantage on the court   both real  i m definitely undersized  and perceived  no one expected a short indian kid to be any good    through hustle and perfecting a low left handed heave that i used whenever i could beat my man into the lane  <BRK> my crowning achievement came in the final second of a little league championship game  when i went to the free throw line with my team down a point  both shot clanked around the rim but went in  <BRK> in college  watching the sport became equally addictive   especially now that i wa at unc chapel hill  my senior year  the tar heel won their fourth n c a a  championship  <BRK> now  at age    i am a new york city dad who watch carolina basketball obsessively with his three son and who  after a   year hiatus  thanks to a couple of knee surgery  decided to play pickup again  but on the court recently  i came to a shocking realization  <BRK> my ugly but effective left handed heave wa no longer effective  i had become the player in the pickup game who everyone leaf open from a distance  <BRK> call it ego  but i really didn t want to be that guy  so i turned to the only expert i knew   my   year old son s basketball coach  <BRK> macky bergman     run steady bucket  a nonprofit that teach more than     boy and girl from around the city  coach macky  a everyone call him  is a product of new york city baketball   he wa a star player at bronx science and played four year at the university of rochester  he asured me that anyone could learn to shoot if they put the time in  <BRK> but could a middle aged  undersized father of three really remake his jump shot and become a solid pickup basketball player again  <BRK> coach macky and i met in early october on a typical outdoor court   fenced in blacktop  metal backboard  rim with no net   on second avenue and  th street  it wa   a m  on a weekday  so the place wa vacant  except for a grouing tenant who lived near the court and aked u to practice a far away from his home a possible  this somewhat safe space meant i could relax a little  although the pressure wa still on  a both macky and the time photographer  sent to track my progress  were both former college player  <BRK> we began with a shooting test  a series of midrange and   point jumper while moving between five spot on the court  i did this   time  shooting   free throw after each round  by the end i wa drenched in sweat  <BRK> the result weren t great     percent from the free throw line    percent on   point jumper and an abysmal   percent from the   point line  a for my self taught shooting technique  which even my son  kavi  had described a  pretty ugly   coach macky decided we would have to start over from scratch  <BRK> in our first few session  we set about eraing the muscle memory of   to develop proper form  we started a close to the baket a possible   almost directly under the rim  <BRK> the ball wa to be perched just above my eye  on the fingertip of my left hand  directly underneath the right angle at the bend of my elbow  my guide hand would hold the right side of the ball  <BRK> for my lower body  knee bent  foot shoulder width apart  weight on the ball of my foot  then i wa to push the ball up   not out   release and follow through  finger pointed down  <BRK>  on the follow through  kobe sometimes join his thumb and index finger  and his guide hand point at the basket   macky would say   steph curry s guide hand flip out and his arm come together   <BRK> the more shot i took   the goal wa   baket in a row   the more i could feel myself adapting  set  shoot  follow through  take one step forward and catch the ball a it come through the net  repeat  it wa surprisingly meditative  before i knew it  i had made it all the way to   shot in a row  <BRK> but macky had identified some weakness  <BRK> for one  i wa landing with one leg practically a foot in front of the other  macky had me stick a soccer ball between my leg and practice a series of jump shot while squeezing it between my knee  <BRK> this wa surprisingly hard   either i d brick the shot  or the soccer ball would pop out   until i focused on taking really small jump  landing like i wa on train track  kavi even sort of complimented me  calling this an  advanced drill  that only the teenager do  <BRK> coach macky encouraged me to attend his weekly shooting clinic at a high school on the lower east side with about two dozen of his other student  they were all between   and   year old  including my son  <BRK> i tried to blend in standing with the coach  that didn t last long  when macky assigned me to work with one of them  torrence ested  the first thing coach torrence said to me wa   i got you old man   <BRK> when i asked kavi who he thought wa more embarrassed the whole venture   me or him   his vague reply spoke volume   tough to say   he responded  <BRK> for the final lesson  coach macky moved me out to the   point line  i d never been comfortable shooting the three  because my old jump shot wa a heave that began at the chest  it wa all arm and no leg  <BRK> a it turned out  i d been learning how to be a better   point shooter all along  proper technique and good arc make for a more accurate shot  regardless of distance  <BRK> the difference wa clear in my final set of drill  i shot above   percent from the free throw line    percent on my two pointer  and a remarkably improved   percent from   point range  <BRK> but improving my stats wa never really the point  i ve started hooping again at the mcburney ymca on west  th street and reconnecting with the sport i ve loved since i wa a kid practicing in the backyard  my jumper is still a work in progress  but i m not being left wide open on it anymore  <BRK> at a recent pickup session   with adult  this time   i wa shooting for the last spot in the next game and wa matched against the best shooter in our group  we both made our first two free throw  but on the third shot his bounced out  mine found the bottom of the net  <BRK> not quite the little league championship game  but i ll take it  <BRK>  <BRK>
