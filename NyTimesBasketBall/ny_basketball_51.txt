when i went to the free throw line with my team down a point  both shot clank around the rim but went in <BRK>in colleg  watch the sport becam equal addict   especi now that i was at unc chapel hill

the pickup game who everyon leav open from a distanc <BRK>call it ego  but i realli didn t want to be that guy  so i turn to the onli expert i knew   my   year old son s basketbal coach <BRK>macki bergman     run steadi bucket  a nonprofit that teach more than     boy and girl from around the citi  coach macki  as everyon call him  is a product of new york citi basketbal   he was a star player at bronx scienc and play four year at the univers of rochest  he assur me that anyon could learn to shoot if they put the time in <BRK>but could a middl age  unders father of three realli remak his jump shot and becom a solid pickup basketbal player again <BRK>coach macki and i met in earli octob on a typic outdoor court   fenc in blacktop  metal backboard  rim with no net   on second avenu and  th street  it was   a m  on a weekday  so the place was vacant  except for a grous tenant who live near the court and ask us to practic as far away from his home as possibl  this somewhat safe space meant i could relax a littl  although the pressur was still on  as both macki and the time photograph  sent to track my progress  were both former colleg player <BRK>we began with a shoot test  a seri of midrang and   point jumper while move between five spot on the court  i did this   time  shoot   free throw after each round  by the end i was drench in sweat <BRK>the result weren t great     percent from the free throw line    percent on   point jumper and an abysm   percent from the   point line  as for my self taught shoot techniqu  which even my son  kavi  had describ as  pretti ugli   coach macki decid we would have to start over from scratch <BRK>in our first few session  we set about eras the muscl memori of   to develop proper form  we start as close to the basket as possibl   almost direct under the rim <BRK>the ball was to be perch just abov my eye  on the fingertip of my left hand  direct underneath the right angl at the bend of my elbow  my guid hand would hold the right side of the ball <BRK>for my lower bodi  knee bent  feet shoulder width apart  weight on the ball of my feet  then i was to push the ball up   not out   releas and follow through  finger point down <BRK> on the follow through  kobe sometim join his thumb and index finger  and his guid hand point at the basket   macki would say   steph curri s guid hand flip out and his arm come togeth  <BRK>the more shot i took   the goal was   basket in a row   the more i could feel myself adapt  set  shoot  follow through  take one step forward and catch the ball as it come through the net  repeat  it was surpris medit  befor i knew it  i had made it all the way to   shot in a row <BRK>but macki had identifi some weak <BRK>for one  i was land with one leg practic a foot in front of the other  macki had me stick a soccer ball between my leg and practic a seri of jump shot while squeez it between my knee <BRK>this was surpris hard   either i d brick the shot  or the soccer ball would pop out   until i focus on take realli small jump  land like i was on train track  kavi even sort of compliment me  call this an  advanc drill  that onli the teenag do <BRK>coach macki encourag me to attend his week shoot clinic at a high school on the lower east side with about two dozen of his other student  they were all between   and   year old  includ my son <BRK>i tri to blend in stand with the coach  that didn t last long  when macki assign me to work with one of them  torrenc est  the first thing coach torrenc said to me was   i got you old man  <BRK>when i ask kavi who he thought was more embarrass the whole ventur   me or him   his vagu repli spoke volum   tough to say   he respond <BRK>for the final lesson  coach macki move me out to the   point line  i d never been comfort shoot the three  becaus my old jump shot was a heav that began at the chest  it was all arm and no leg <BRK>as it turn out  i d been learn how to be a better   point shooter all along  proper techniqu and good arc make for a more accur shot  regardless of distanc <BRK>the differ was clear in my final set of drill  i shot abov   percent from the free throw line    percent on my two pointer  and a remark improv   percent from   point rang <BRK>but improv my stat was never realli the point  i ve start hoop again at the mcburney ymca on west  th street and reconnect with the sport i ve love sinc i was a kid practic in the backyard  my jumper is still a work in progress  but i m not be left wide open on it anymor <BRK>at a recent pickup session   with adult  this time   i was shoot for the last spot in the next game and was match against the best shooter in our group  we both made our first two free throw  but on the third shot his bounc out  mine found the bottom of the net <BRK>not quit the littl leagu championship game  but i ll take it <BRK><BRK>
