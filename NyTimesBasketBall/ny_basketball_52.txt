<BRK><BRK>by david waldstein and ben shpigel<BRK>one of the oldest adage about college basketball is that guard play is the key to tournament success  amid the intensity and mayhem that unfold each march  it is often the most composed  savvy and talented guard who determine the fate of their team  but not always <BRK>on saturday  three of the best guard in the country showcased their skill in the n c a a  men s basketball tournament  one made the winning basket  another who is known for range could not make a   point shot  and perhaps the best guard of all probably played his last game in college <BRK>ja morant  the singular talent from murray state  hit his first five   point attempt and poured in   point  but the  th seeded racer could not handle no    florida state a the seminole advanced to the round of   with a     victory in hartford <BRK>in jacksonville  fla   tremont water of no    louisiana state  one of the most dynamic point guard in the country  pushed his team to victory against no    maryland <BRK>later on the same court  fletcher magee  the brilliant distance shooter for no    wofford   the player who set an n c a a  record for career   pointer       went a staggering   for   from beyond the arc a the terrier lost      to no    kentucky <BRK>like magee  water missed all of his   point attempt  he took four   but it did not matter  his driving  scooping layup with     second left gave the tiger a     win and ignited a huge celebratory pileup <BRK>water ran the final possession to perfection  punctuating an intrepid dribble drive with the winning scoop shot  for those who follow l s u  basketball  it wa not surprising  early in the season  coach will wade impressed upon water the importance of ball security telling him the basketball wa like the state of louisiana <BRK> if i turn the ball over   water said friday   then it s not good for the state and obviously for our baketball program a a whole  <BRK>wade  who is suspended indefinitely after being linked to a recruiting scandal  did not accompany the tiger to jacksonville  but his advice still resonated for water  whose late game ball handling helped the tiger avoid what would have been a dreadful collapse against maryland  l s u  will play michigan state on friday night in washington in it first trip to the round of   since    when it reached the final four <BRK> they re big time athlete   maryland coach mark turgeon said   crazy athlete  and the point guard is terrific  <BRK>to slip past maryland  l s u  overcame a miserable stretch in the second half  when the terrapin      zone forced the tiger into deep outside shot  maryland erased a   point deficit  and the team traded lead until the terrapin tied the score one final time  on jalen smith s   pointer with     second left <BRK>playing for the final shot  l s u  put the ball in the hand of water  who started moving toward the basket with about   second to go  he dribbled toward the   foot   smith  hesitated  and then ducked around him before flipping an underhand shot off the glass <BRK>when a desperation shot maryland bounced off the top of the backboard at the buzzer  the tiger piled on water <BRK> i wa in the bottom of the dog pile   water said   and just the feeling  it feel amazing  <BRK>morant s feeling were not so gleeful  still  he finished averaging     point and     point to become the first player in division i to average at least   point and   assist in a season  he scored   point in the first half  but florida state clamped down  blanketing the other four racer to keep morant from dishing to them  he had only four assist <BRK> to be honest with you  i m still not sure that we stopped morant   florida state coach leonard hamilton said   and i m not sure anybody can  <BRK>that tak will likely now be up to n b a  coach a morant  who captivated the country with a magnificent triple double performance in murray state s first round win against marquette  is expected to leave college and be a top pick in the draft <BRK>but he wa not willing to discus that after the loss  instead  he reflected on his final moment of the seaon a he sat on the bench with a towel over his head <BRK> i really wa just thinking back on what all we have accomplished this year   he said   and i d say i wa more hurt not being able to play with these guy for the remainder of the season  <BRK>kentucky avoided disater  but it might not have if magee had shot the ball a well a he usually doe  wofford kept the game close and wa within     after keve aluma tipped in a shot with le than   second left  but after kentucky s reid travis hit two free throw  magee missed his  th and final   point attempt with five second left <BRK> it s incredibly disappointing   magee said   i feel like if i make three of those shot  we win the game  you know  a lot of them were good shot  and just  they didn t go in  <BRK>wofford led a many a   late in the first half  but kentucky extended it defense to smother magee  mostly with tyler herro and ahton hagans powering over screen and helping out when necessary <BRK> the game plan wa jut make him make a basketball play  put it on the floor   hagans said   that s what we were trying to do  tyler did a great job of talking to me when he wanted to switch  but you know  for u to be at our best  we ve jut got to talk and be for one another  <BRK>magee said other team in the southern conference had made similar move to defend him  without kentucky s success <BRK> i think some of it definitely wa their good defense   he said   and mainly a lot of it wa just me being off my shot  <BRK>villanova s championship reign ended with an     loss to no    purdue  which got a career high   point carsen edward  villanova won last year s national title and two of the last three  but struggled this year  losing   game <BRK>on saturday  villanova gave up     pointer  including nine edward <BRK>few team let   pointer fly more than fifth seeded auburn  and the tiger could not seem to miss in burying fourth seeded kansa       in salt lake city <BRK>bryce brown  who scored   point  made seven of his first eight   pointer a auburn raced to a     lead at halftime  kansa got it offensive untracked in the second half  but it could never slow auburn down enough to make the tiger sweat <BRK>the tiger  who took       pointer in the regular season  fourth most among division i team  made nine of their     pointer in the first half  point guard jared harper added   point for auburn <BRK>the jayhawks began the season ranked no    but lost three key player   center udoka azubuike sustained a wrist injury  forward silvio de souza wa suspended and guard lagerald vick left the team   and their   year big   conference title streak ended  dedric

 in de moines to reach the round of   for the third consecutive season and fourth time since   <BRK>jordan poole scored   of his game high   point in michigan s     run to start the second half  the wolverine held a     edge on the glas  with the     center jon teske grabbing   rebound  michigan coach john beilein pulled his starter a a unit with     second to play to a standing ovation from wolverine fan seated behind their bench  jalen hudson led florida with   point <BRK> they really had u confued in the first half becaue they kept changing defense on u   beilein said   fortunately we were able to get stop so they couldn t set the defense in the second half  <BRK>brandon clarke is not a candidate for the wooden award  or the oscar robertson award  or the naismith trophy  the three all american team of the united state basketball writer association did not include him <BRK>but clarke showed why he is gonzaga s most indispensable player <BRK>the forward  a transfer from san jose state   the only program that offered him a scholarship out of high school   wa dominant and the difference a the top seeded zag advanced with an     victory over determined baylor <BRK>clarke scored   point   missing only three shot   and also contributed   rebound    block    assist and   steal  and most important for the zag  he helped thwart several robust charge in the second half the ninth
