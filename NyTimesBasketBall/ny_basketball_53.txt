<BRK><BRK>by john branch<BRK>la vega   the knowing nod come a soon a the name john higgins is mentioned to veteran college baketball official  it could happen to any of u  they say  the way thing are going <BRK>higgins is one of the top referee in the sport  but it wa during a taut n c a a  tournament matchup in   that he trended on twitter and quickly became the target of harassment frustrated kentucky fan certain that higgins wa the reason that the wildcat had lost a quarterfinal game against north carolina <BRK>higgins and his family received death threat  and his roofing and siding business received thousand of harassing phone call  mostly from kentucky area code  and an onslaught of negative review  according to a lawsuit that higgins later filed against a radio station he accused of fanning the discord <BRK> while a basketball game is only played between two team  there are three major group of player at each game  the winning team  the losing team  and  increasingly visible with instant replay on every television broadcast  the referee   read the lawsuit  which wa dismissed in united state district court on wednesday  nearly   month after it wa filed    speech on matter of public concern in a public place is entitled to special first amendment protection   the judge wrote  <BRK>a the n c a a  men s baketball tournament begin this week  the only team certain to reach the final four wear black and white striped jersey with no number  it is likely that some referee will be accused of incompetence  others can expect to be blamed for game outcome somewhere along the way <BRK> we re under the highest amount of scrutiny we ve ever been under   said mike reed  a division i official since   now entering his  th n c a a  tournament <BRK>it is not just college basketball  official have become leading character in the pasion play of american sport  an overlooked pas interference hubbub in the recent n f l  playoff  the overturned foul after kevin durant smashed into lebron james in last year s n b a  final  or dispute about home run in major league baseball s playoff <BRK>in tennis  the   united state open may be remembered for serena williams s reaction to officiating call in the woman s final a much a for the play of the winner  naomi osaka  even umpire at lat year s little league world series were not immune <BRK>barry mano  a former college baketball official who founded referee magazine in   and the national asociation of sport official in    see the magnifying glas a a mirror to society <BRK> now officiating is public and  in some way  a petri dish in which the culture of sport and our larger culture get agitated  stirred together   he wrote in the latest issue of referee <BRK>in few place do official work in such a high speed pressure cooker like that of a college basketball arena  unlike their n b a  counterpart  highly paid coach are the face of the college game and the main mouthpiece to the referee  and allegiant fan follow their lead  lightning quick decision are untangled slow motion replay on screen in the arena and on television for those watching at home  victory can mean big financial reward for coach and college  social medium spread angst in real time <BRK> the speed of information is cauing referee to be more visible   said j d  collins  the n c a a  s national coordinator of men s basketball official   our best hope is to have u be invisible  do our job and go home  but i m afraid we are no longer in that environment  <BRK>in      percent of official of all sport at all level said that sportmanship wa getting worse    percent said it wa getting better   according to a survey the sport official  association of more than     official  the number were grimmer in basketball  in which   percent said sportmanship wa declining <BRK> sport is simply life with the volume turned up   mano said in an interview   why should we be surprised this  we re louder  we re brasher  we don t want to be told no  when we don t like a decision  we look for another opinion  that s how we got replay  <BRK>yet even a the light on officiating get harsher  an analysis of all n c a a  tournament game lat year found that official made the right call     percent of the time when they blew their whistle  collins said  no call  where no whistle wa blown on close play  were correct about   percent of the time  he added <BRK>to watch and listen to the exasperated reaction from coach and fan  however  the proportion of blown call feel more like     <BRK> the expectation is that you start out perfect   said reed  the n c a a  tournament referee   and you get better from there  <BRK>this season  the n c a a  put a renewed focus on bench decorum  hoping to clamp down on the boorish behavior of coach   who might set an example for fan  coach are restricted to a short stretch of sideline where they often pace impatiently  like caged cat  while barking incessantly  like neighborhood dog <BRK>the emphais ha not prevented several noteworthy episode in recent week  a when mississippi coach kermit davis shed his coat and threw it down in disgust after a call late in a game  leading fan to throw garbage on the court   lat week  davis wa named the southeatern conference s coach of the year   the same night  eat carolina coach joe dooley wa ejected with two technical against houston  one of his player followed getting thrown out  too  a wa one of the fan throwing garbage toward the court <BRK>at iowa last month  coach fran mccaffery wa suspended his university for two game for berating an official in a hallway after a loss <BRK>at the pac   conference tournament in la vega  utah s larry krystkowiak got a technical on friday when he swatted a water cup on press row  a few block away at the mountain west conference tournament  new mexico coach paul weir received a momentum shifting technical when he rushed down the sideline after a questionable call <BRK>moment later  fan filled the arena with a chant   you suck  ref  <BRK> i don t know the exact rule on that   maybe he s right   weir said   i wa just voicing my displeasure on a play  i think coach get that way a lot  <BRK>the n c a a   which said it had not tracked the number of technical called this season compared with previous year  tried to set a consistent standard heading into the national tournament <BRK> part of the responsibility of a coach is to let an official know when we either miss a call or they think we miss a call   collins said   but based on the   to   percent figure  it isn t every call  <BRK>there are   division i men s baketball official  each of them an independent contractor working for a handful of regional coalition  they make roughly      to      per game  depending on their experience and the matchup   kentucky s john calipari  the highest paid coach in college baketball  made about      per game this seaon  if his nearly      million annual salary is divided the   game kentucky ha played   there are no benefit  and official are generally not reimbursed for travel or other cost  while most referee do it a a part time job from late fall to early spring  a few dozen officiate a their primary income  stringing together several game each week  maybe   or more game a seaon <BRK>and just a team hope to be picked for the   team n c a a  tournament  official hoped to be among the   selected to work the game  the best advance to the next round <BRK> all of u want to go to the final four   said tony padilla  a longtime official who made it there in   and     it s funny  becaue then you re under more scrutiny and under the microscope more than any time  it s kind of weird  right  <BRK>they will go through more ups and down than any team  they will draw the ire of nearly everyone watching  but referee will be there at the end  the tournament s only sure bet <BRK> we don t have any home game  and we don t have a student section cheering for u   said randy mccall  a division i referee since   who regularly work deep into the tournament   it can be a grind  especially late in the year  but i chose this  and i wouldn t have it any other way  <BRK>the next night  mccall officiated a pac   semifinal game between arizona state and oregon  both team have coach who pace and bark  when they stand still they merely look perplexed or agitated <BRK>the game wa a testy one  headed to overtime  between team desperate to reach the n c a a  tournament  in the second half  mccall called a foul on an arizona state player who blocked a shot  the sun devil  coach  bobby hurley  wa enraged  replay on the enormous video board sent hurley into a frenzy  fan howled at the official <BRK>a night earlier  a cheer from a nearby game swirled into a dim arena hallway  mccall had discussed the occaional blown call  and the outrage that wa sure to follow one <BRK> the only time i really remember when i look back over my career are the mistake i made   the mistake that were critical mistake  at critical time of a game  that maybe changed the outcome   mccall said   and i don t need to read anything on social medium to know  believe me  <BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK>
