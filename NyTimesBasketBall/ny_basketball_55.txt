 <BRK>  <BRK> by billy witz <BRK> lawrence  kan    the   year run of big   baketball championhip ended two week ago  when kansa s crown pased to texa tech and kansa state  a yearlong reign a conference tournament champion came to a close lat weekend  with the jayhawks beaten iowa state in the final  <BRK> there will be no flashy big   championship ring to pas out to the player next season  no new year to add to the league championship banner in the allen fieldhouse rafter  <BRK> at kansa  a fixture in the n c a a  tournament  a season that began with great and usual expectation   and with the jayhawks being ranked no    in the country   ha instead become one of trial  quite literally  and tribulation  <BRK>  it s a real test of the fan   said kevin willmott  who won an oscar last month for co writing spike lee s  blackkklansman   and teach film study at the university  <BRK>  follow our live coverage of the n c a a  tournament here   <BRK> one key player wa lost to a seaon ending injury  another is stuck in n c a a  enforcement limbo  a third just went home  the coach  drawn into a recruiting scandal playing out in federal court  sometimes feel a if they spend a much time conferring with their lawyer a they do with their team  <BRK> of the dramatic arc that ha unfolded  willmott  who sat behind the jayhawks  bench for a game two week ago  said   it s probably not a film  but probably an episode of a tv show where you get your character tested a little bit  we ve had a great thing for a long time  we re not used to the ball not falling our way   <BRK> the fan still turn up  of course  allen fieldhouse wa dutifully full on the final day of the regular seaon  with     fan shoehorned into the venerable old barn  just a they have been for every kansa baketball home game since nov        <BRK> the recognizable sign of the cocoon were everywhere  the crowd roaring to life at the opening tip  the confetti tossed when david mccormack threw down a dunk  the young fan holding up a sign announcing his commitment   to the class of    <BRK> a the final second wound down  the student behind each baket serenaded the home team with their haunting  rock chalk jayhawk  chant  marking another victory over baylor  which ha never won here  and cementing another perfect seaon at home   the  th since allen fieldhouse opened in    <BRK> it wa all so familiar and yet  a virtually everyone in the building could sense  it wa not  <BRK> the hulking junior center udoka azubuike  a potent a post player a there is in college baketball when healthy  ha been lost for the seaon because of torn ligament in his right hand  the deadeye guard lagerald vick  the team s only senior   and a starter on lat year s final four team   returned home to memphis several week ago for personal reaons and will not return  forward silvio de sousa  who practice with the team and sits on the bench in street clothes with azubuike during game  ha been barred from playing the n c a a  since a shoe company consultant testified in october that he funneled money to de sousa s guardian  <BRK> what ha given this season a darker tint  though  is the uncertainty about what fallout lie ahead from the f b i  corruption investigation that ha roiled college basketball  ensnaring not only kansa but louisville  arizona  louisiana state  oklahoma state  southern california  auburn and north carolina state  among others  <BRK> kansa took it uncomfortable turn in the spotlight last october when t j  gassnola  a basketball consultant for adidas  which ha a   year     million apparel contract with the university s athletic program  testified in a brooklyn courtroom that he had arranged payment to the family of two kansa player  <BRK> though gassnola said he never told kansa coach bill self about the payment  lawyer for the former adidas executive james gatto on trial pointed to text message between gassnola and self and a kansa assistant  kurtis townsend  in which gassnola pledged his help in landing player  <BRK> another trial  for bribery charge against three defendant in the corruption case  is set to begin in april  shortly after the final four  <BRK> self said the revelation in the case  which the n c a a  is investigating  have not been troublesome to his player   other than de souza  who the university ha argued is being punished unjustly   but acknowledged that the development have hovered over the coaching staff and will continue to do so  he called the case  draining   <BRK>  instead of doing thing that you would worry about doing to make your program better  whether it s recruiting or extra film session or more time in the individual meeting with player  i m talking to attorney   self said  <BRK>  it s not so much that we ve done anything  but we re trying to get a game plan on when s our next move  when can we do this  so from that standpoint  everybody deal with distraction  but this ha been a big distraction   for the coach  not the player   <BRK> the depleted jayhawks roster is a bigger concern  it ha left kansa with a starting lineup of four freshman surrounding dedric lawson  a junior forward who transferred from memphis  there ha been a predictable level of inconsistency   a   point blowout loss at texas tech  for example  wa followed two day later a   point thumping of kansa state  <BRK>  it s    first date    drew barrymore could star in it with our team   self said  referring to the movie   it s something new every day   <BRK> a frank a self is about his team s relative shortcoming  he is not at all disappointed in it     record  given the absence of three crucial player  the difficult schedule and the lineup s collective inexperience  <BRK>  the freshman have done pretty well  but it s not your typical freshman like duke ha or some other people have   self said  <BRK> one of them  mccormack  a   foot      pound center  ha shown encouraging sign of development lately  playing off lawson  whom self called the best player in the conference  to give the jayhawks a credible low post presence they have largely lacked since azubuike wa injured in early january  <BRK> the next week  then   the jayhawks open the n c a a  tournament with a game against northeastern on thursday   is an opportunity for the jayhawks to set aside the disappointment of falling from their perch  and to come to term with more modest prospect  <BRK>  it s just the outside people  the expectation playing at kansa   lawson said of the weight of the conference streak   personally  i didn t really hear the noise  i just wanted to win a big   title for myself  plus you wanted to keep the legacy going  <BRK>  at the end of the day  we fell short  and it s not the end of the world   he said   going forward  we just want to be the best team we can be and have the best year we can have   <BRK> an earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of an oscar winner who teach film study at kansa  he is kevin willmott  not wilmott  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
