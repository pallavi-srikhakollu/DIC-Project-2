 <BRK>  <BRK> n c a a  tournament  east region preview <BRK> michigan state loom a the biggest threat in the region for a team that reasumed it favorite status once zion williamson returned  <BRK> by the new york time <BRK> after getting zion williamson back from a knee injury and winning the atlantic coast conference tournament  duke wa named the overall no    seed in the n c a a  field  the blue devil will be a heavy favorite to storm to the final four in minneapolis  but it won t necessarily be a cakewalk  the biggest obstacle could be michigan state  which shared the big ten regular season title and won the conference tournament  michigan state had perhaps the strongest case to peel off one of the a c c  s no    seed  yet it somehow wound up with a tougher road than michigan  which is the no    behind gonzaga in the west   <BRK>    duke       v     n c  central n  dakota st  <BRK>    virginia commonwealth       v     central florida       <BRK>    mississippi state       v

foot   product of mississauga  ontario  wa the no    player in his high school class and the projected no    pick in the n b a  draft right up until the start of the season  the son of the former st  john s player rowan barrett and kesha barrett  formerly kesha duhaney   a nationally ranked sprinter and long jumper for the red storm  barrett had high level athletics in his gene  <BRK> after deciding to further his basketball career at an american prep powerhouse  the left handed barrett last year led florida s montverde academy to a     record and a national championship while sweeping every major national player of the year award  <BRK> that could have led to some friction  or even jealousy  between williamson and barrett  both of whom were already being discussed a potential lottery pick before they chose a college  but what many don t know is that barrett helped persuade williamson to commit to duke  their friendship blossomed in a group chat started yet another duke recruit  the freshman point guard tre jones  who had set it up after he committed in an effort to persuade barrett and williamson to join him in durham  n c  <BRK> that early familiarity eased the initiation of all three player into the rigor of a c c  basketball   and to life together on one of the country s best team  <BRK>  the beauty of this year s team is that they re very comfortable with who they are  so there s not a lot of jealousy   the former duke star grant hill said   there s a real friendship and bond  particularly with those young guy  so there s not this competitive rivalry   <BRK> only after the college basketball world saw exactly how uncommonly powerful and explosive williamson is did barrett  slip  to the projected no    pick in this year s n b a  draft  yet it is the silky barrett who lead the blue devil in scoring at nearly   point a game  all while nearly matching williamson in rebound and jones in assist  <BRK> and while many contemplate williamson s seemingly unlimited upside  there are some who believe barrett s all around game and   foot   frame make him   at the moment   a more polished fit for the n b a  <BRK>  we ll definitely be happy for each other   barrett told ncaa com last month of the prospect of going first and second in the draft with williamson   whoever go   or    it doesn t really matter to u  i m going to be happy for my brother  we ve both been working for this for a long time  so we re jut happy to see each other succeed   <BRK> the turner sport analyst charles barkley is among the group who contend barrett still deserves consideration for the no    overall pick  it is barrett  after all  not williamson  who set the a c c  freshman scoring record with   point this season  he is also averaging     rebound and     assist  <BRK>  his skill set is jalen rose  james harden  somewhere in between there   barkley said last week at an event in manhattan   you can t tell until you get to the pro   adam zagoria <BRK> the east region feature more than a whiff of scandal  louisiana state s coach  will wade  wa suspended after he wa reported to have boasted on a wiretapped phone conversation about making an offer to a recruit  the tiger will take on yale  whose athletic department  though not it basketball team  wa drawn into the middle of a sprawling college admission scandal  in another matchup  minnesota  coached richard pitino  will face louisville  which fired his father  rick  in    kevin draper <BRK> belmont won   game but had to sweat out selection sunday after losing to murray state in the ohio valley conference tournament final  the reward for the bruin  patience is a midweek game against temple  but that is still better than watching from home  kevin draper <BRK>  <BRK>
