<BRK><BRK>by billy witz<BRK>greensboro  n c    a advanced statistical analysis and it attendant new technology continue to reshape how sport are understood  watched and even played   when to punt on fourth down in football  where to position a baeball team s infielder and how to build a winning baketball team   these new number also create a vexing problem <BRK>how to account for what complex algorithm cannot explain <BRK>the thirst for information is such that one essential set of college basketball data that will help determine the field for this month s n c a a  tournament  ken pomeroy s eponymous kenpom rating  includes a metric to shed light on when thing do not actually go the number <BRK>pomeroy ha a rather analog term for it  luck <BRK> luck is basically performance in close game   pomeroy said   people generally don t like the term  luck    that s the feedback i get  technically  i d call it  randomness  or something a lot more wordy  but that doesn t fit well above a column  <BRK>in short  kenpom s luck factor considers the difference between a team s record and what the data would expect it to be  if a team s record is better than it predictive number  it is lucky  if it is worse  then it is unlucky <BRK>this season  according to the kenpom rating  no team among the   division i college men s basketball program ha been luckier than the university of north carolina at greensboro <BRK>the spartan resemble a team one might expect from a coach  wes miller  who transferred to north carolina a a walk on  then earned a letter on a national championship team and eventually a spot in the starting lineup  they are resourceful and determined  and have the ethos  and the recruiting budget  of an underdog <BRK>greensboro ha a     record   the best in program history   and finished second in the southern conference  behind wofford  which wa ranked  th in this week s associated press poll <BRK>did luck have something to do with it <BRK>miller  pulling up a folding chair before a recent practice  reacted a one might expect  he praised pomeroy a  a genius   expressed facination with analytics and said there were others on his staff who delve deeper into the data to provide the most salient information about the spartan and their opponent <BRK>then he assumed a defensive stance <BRK> i m not a mathematician   he said   i m a basketball coach who s always trying to figure out an edge to help me coach better  but there s never been anybody that could put a number on will and togetherness of group <BRK> there s something that s happening in our game that s indescribable to his data that s getting u over the hump   miller added   that s toughness  that s the ability to win close game  the proudest i ever am a a coach is when we have an awful shooting game or we have an awful offensive game and thing don t go our way and we still find a way becaue our team wa able to dig down and figure out a way to get over the hump  <BRK>francis alonso  a senior guard from malaga  spain  who is the heartbeat of his team  put it another way   there s this saying   it s champion  luck  <BRK>alan castel  a psychology professor at u c l a  who study memory and metacognition   how we think about our thinking   said that while confidence  or the lack of it  is a fundamental element of athletic competition  it is often misplaced <BRK> the human mind doesn t rely on big data   said castel  whose research ha debunked the hot hand theory   the belief that a team should get the ball to a shooter who is on a hot streak   we re prone to rely on illusion and small sample size and what we want to think  <BRK>if greensboro s spartan are the luckiest team in the country  he said  they deserve some of the credit for it <BRK> to be lucky  you need to put yourself in a situation   castel said   to win the lottery  you need to buy a ticket  <BRK>or  he added  to win the n c a a  tournament  you need to get in  and to do that  the spartan almost certainly will require a little more luck <BRK>some year ago  a résumé like the spartan  might have looked glossier  they have a sparkling record  are     in game decided   point or fewer and have been competitive in defeat at  th ranked louisiana state       and sixth ranked kentucky        a game that they led with le than nine minute left  but they lost to wofford twice in the regular season     and   point   and for a third time on monday night       in the southern conference tournament championship game <BRK>yet it is this profile   a team that ha squeaked past bad team  competed against good one and been pounded only twice  the best team in it conference   that explains why greensboro s luck factor is      which  if it hold until the season is over  would be the highest of any team since   <BRK>what that figure mean  pomeroy said  is that in a luck free environment  the spartan  winning percentage would be     lower than it is  a a result  they would have six fewer victory   and a     record   without any luck <BRK>there are real world consequence  through tuesday s game  greensboro ranked  st in kenpom s overall rating  lagging behind east tennessee state   st  and furman   th   against whom they combined to win four of five game this season   the n c a a  s new net metric  which the tournament selection committee is using to evaluate team this year  is only slightly kinder  it ha the spartan  th  <BRK>once the n c a a  tournament begin next week  with a broad spectrum of school from around the country  a clearer picture will emerge of whether team that have been deemed to have enjoyed metric good fortune have punched above their weight all season <BRK>the spartan  at this point  would consider themselves lucky to have the chance <BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK>
