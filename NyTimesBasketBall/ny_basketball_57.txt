footbal  where to posit a basebal team s infield and how to build a win basketbal team   these new number also creat a vex problem <BRK>how to account for what complex algorithm cannot explain <BRK>the thirst for inform is such that one essenti set of colleg basketbal data that will help determin the field for this month s n c a a  tournament  ken pomeroy s eponym kenpom rate  includ a metric to shed light on when thing do not actual go the number <BRK>pomeroy has a rather analog term for it  luck <BRK> luck is basic perform in close game   pomeroy said   peopl general don t like the term  luck    that s the feedback i get  technic  i d call it  random  or someth a lot more wordi  but that doesn t fit well abov a column  <BRK>in short  kenpom s luck factor consid the differ between a team s record and what the data would expect it to be  if a team s record is better than it predict number  it is lucki  if it is wors  then it is unlucki <BRK>this season  accord to the kenpom rate  no team among the   divis i colleg men s basketbal program has been luckier than the univers of north carolina at greensboro <BRK>the spartan resembl a team one might expect from a coach  wes miller  who transfer to north carolina as a walk on  then earn a letter on a nation championship team and eventu a spot in the start lineup  they are resourc and determin  and have the etho  and the recruit budget  of an underdog <BRK>greensboro has a     record   the best in program histori   and finish second in the southern confer  behind wofford  which was rank  th in this week s associ press poll <BRK>did luck have someth to do with it <BRK>miller  pull up a fold chair befor a recent practic  react as one might expect  he prais pomeroy as  a genius   express fascin with analyt and said there were other on his staff who delv deeper into the data to provid the most salient inform about the spartan and their oppon <BRK>then he assum a defens stanc <BRK> i m not a mathematician   he said   i m a basketbal coach who s alway tri to figur out an edg to help me coach better  but there s never been anybodi that could put a number on will and togeth of group <BRK> there s someth that s happen in our game that s indescrib to his data that s get us over the hump   miller ad   that s tough  that s the abil to win close game  the proudest i ever am as a coach is when we have an aw shoot game or we have an aw offens game and thing don t go our way and we still find a way becaus our team was abl to dig down and figur out a way to get over the hump  <BRK>franci alonso  a senior guard from malaga  spain  who is the heartbeat of his team  put it anoth way   there s this say   it s champion  luck  <BRK>alan castel  a psycholog professor at u c l a  who studi memori and metacognit   how we think about our think   said that while confid  or the lack of it  is a fundament element of athlet competit  it is often misplac <BRK> the human mind doesn t reli on big data   said castel  whose research has debunk the hot hand theori   the belief that a team should get the ball to a shooter who is on a hot streak   we re prone to reli on illus and small sampl size and what we want to think  <BRK>if greensboro s spartan are the luckiest team in the countri  he said  they deserv some of the credit for it <BRK> to be lucki  you need to put yourself in a situat   castel said   to win the lotteri  you need to buy a ticket  <BRK>or  he ad  to win the n c a a  tournament  you need to get in  and to do that  the spartan almost certain will requir a littl more luck <BRK>some year ago  a résumé like the spartan  might have look glossier  they have a sparkl record  are     in game decid   point or fewer and have been competit in defeat at  th rank louisiana state       and sixth rank kentucki        a game that they led with less than nine minut left  but they lost to wofford twice in the regular season     and   point   and for a third time on monday night       in the southern confer tournament championship game <BRK>yet it is this profil   a team that has squeak past bad team  compet against good one and been pound onli twice  the best team in it confer   that explain whi greensboro s luck factor is      which  if it hold until the season is over  would be the highest of ani team sinc   <BRK>what that figur mean  pomeroy said  is that in a luck free environ  the spartan  win percentag would be     lower than it is  as a result  they would have six fewer victori   and a     record   without ani luck <BRK>there are real world consequ  through tuesday s game  greensboro rank  st in kenpom s overal rate  lag behind east tennesse state   st  and furman   th   against whom they combin to win four of five game this season   the n c a a  s new
