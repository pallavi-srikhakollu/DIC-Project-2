<BRK><BRK>by peter s  goodman<BRK>london   in theory at least  we understand the word on the sport radio we hear incessantly   in taxi  at the fish and chip place  at the corner newsstand  but we are foreigner here and the story are inscrutable  full of happening from cricket oval and rugby pitch <BRK>our sport focus is confined to our darkened living room  where my   year old son  leo  and i have lately been absorbing improbable happening from the other side of the atlantic   one exhilarating victory after another for our suddenly mighty brooklyn net <BRK>this ha become our early morning ritual  wife and daughter still asleep  the boy watch the action from the night before  the score carefully hidden from our n b a  league pas app lest we ruin the ending <BRK>we are basketball expatriate  two step removed from the initial source of my n b a  obsession a change of team loyalty and a move to london <BRK>in our north london surroundings  we may a well be rooting for a badminton team from bhutan  while the odd lebron james jersey can be spotted  our brooklyn net gear seemingly fade into the sea of yankee cap brought home tourist returning from new york  oblivious to the hate they are inspiring from this mets fan  and the endless brooklyn related mumbo jumbo that now adorns t shirt worldwide <BRK> net  run to the playoff hit a snag with spencer dinwiddie injury <BRK>while n f l  gear is a common sighting  owing to the constant staging of american football game here  n b a  baketball is largely invisible  one imago this wa unaltered the recent showdown of two of the league s most dreadful team  the knicks and the wahington wizard  inside london s unlovable o  arena   we did not attend  just a we do not take leisure trip to see the dentist  <BRK>our sport related conversation with briton tend to revolve around the atronomical ticket price required to see arsenal  the english premier league soccer team leo ha decided that we love forever  our net fandom is like membership in a secret society  whose disclosure would mark u a eccentric and produce puzzlement <BRK>even my knick fan friend back in new york do not want to hear about the net via email  my only real communion come via obscure net related podcasts i listen to while washing the dish  when bill simmons and zach lowe devoted perhaps   minute of a recent pod to the net surge  i confess to feeling of pride and validation i can only liken to a u f o  conspiracy theorist hearing that the government is probing the sighting of a flying saucer <BRK>my embrace of the net began seven year ago when the knicks   the only team i had ever rooted for   shunned a gift from the basketball god letting jeremy lin leave town  it wa the final indignity after year of atrocious basketball  i dumped my knicks season ticket and adopted the fledgling club whose arena had just risen over my brooklyn neighborhood <BRK>i did not do so lightly  a a born and bred new yorker  i saw abandoning a team a a serious breach of the tribal code  i disdained fan from other city who rooted for two team in the same sport  i wa unremittingly harsh to the worst transgressor of all  the bandwagon fan   if that steph curry jersey you own wa the first warrior gear in your closet  yes  i m talking about you  <BRK>but i wa hopping on no bandwagon  with the exception of a pair of distant trip to the n b a  final  the new jersey turned brooklyn net were a pathetic franchise  i wa living in brooklyn  my father had grown up in queen and traveled on a streetcar to watch the dodger at ebbets field  i wa not abandoning my tribe  i wa returning to it <BRK>this is what i told myself a i began reading about the odd collection of player i wa now rooting for  trying to divine the narrative that would make it real  i fought through a sense of exile in the slick  new barclays center  which wa full of fan for whom the game itself appeared peripheral to the cool brooklyn food  the dancing during timeouts  and whatever facinating thing were happening on their phone <BRK>yes  it wa a gorgeous arena with excellent sightlines and welcoming staff  the season ticket i bought the day the knicks said goodbye to j lin put me in seat that were a   minute walk from my house in prospect height  madison square garden wa a cramped dump reached via a creaking subway and a walk through the bowel of penn station <BRK>yet there wa something about the garden  even a the dolan era yielded a lost decade of baketball  the crowd understood  hustle play drew appreciation in an arena that had revered charles oakley  the energy wa electric <BRK>in brooklyn  the mostly mercenary fan got what we deserved  a team of past their prime castoffs imported the bombastic russian magnate  mikhail prokhorov  who had brought the franchise to brooklyn  vowing to spend whatever it took to eclipse the knicks   a low bar   he built a bonfire of money at the corner of flatbush and atlantic <BRK>in came the wildly overpaid joe johnson  a seven time all star  in came the mediocre gerald wallace in exchange for a first round pick that portland turned into damian lillard  the centerpiece wa the sullen  out of shape deron williams who  in another lifetime  looked like the best point guard on earth  and whose passion no longer appeared to include basketball <BRK>they fit uneasily around the likable   footer  brook lopez  whose sweet shooting came along with rebounding and defensive skill that seemed better suited for other pursuit  like calligraphy <BRK>my history a a knicks fan made the plan feel familiar  win now  baby  the future wa for loser  the oligarch wa buying his way to competitiveness pronto  leaving no doubt  the net soon traded every first round pick until the sun dy for the remains of paul pierce and kevin garnett <BRK>when it all unraveled and the net descended into an unwatchable state  i hung in  you can not renounce the team of your life and then walk away from your new one because they are terrible  real fandom is forged in suffering  even when my family traded brooklyn for london in    we remained net fan <BRK>this happily coincided with another development  the net bucked the conventional wisdom that new york fan will not accept rebuilding and embraced patience <BRK>sean mark  the general manager  somehow turned a collection of mostly indifferent veteran into a raffish crew of young  hungry player led a first time head coach  kenny atkinson  they run at a ferocious pace  share the ball with grace  and play with joy <BRK>since an excruciating eight game losing streak  the net have won   of    even from afar  we can tell that the intensity ha changed at the barclays  the brooook lyyyyn chant filling our london living room <BRK>and still  an intense new york team deserves better  back for the holiday  i took leo to see new orleans and their marquee star  anthony davis  at barclays  the place wa packed with tourist who seemed intent on taking selfies and buying brooklyn gear at the swag shop <BRK>whatever <BRK>on saturday morning  we will sit on the couch in our pajama  leo and me  and see what happened against the now hated  if pitiful  knicks the night before <BRK>please don t tell u who won <BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK>
