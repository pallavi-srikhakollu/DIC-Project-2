<BRK><BRK>by kurt streeter<BRK>seattle   the university of washington men s basketball coach threw a punch  then another <BRK>mike hopkins wan t making contact  he wa shadow boxing  typically multitasking  he wa also telling a hyperkinetic story <BRK>it wa about his day a a boxer in the early  s  but it wa also about why wahington had lost so painfully to oregon day earlier in it final regular seaon game  even his story wa doing two thing at once <BRK>the story hopkins wa telling took place during his undergraduate day at syracuse  when he played guard for the longtime coach jim boeheim  whom he ended up serving a an asistant for   seaons  for a while back then  hopkins also trained in the sweet science <BRK> i did a little boxing in my junior year   he said  bouncing on his toe  he had trained for week before finally entering the ring against a muscular opponent who wa more than ready to fight <BRK>hopkins threw an excited punch into the air   so i m jabbing  jabbing  doing exactly what i d been trained to do   he said   when all of a sudden  bam  my opponent crush me  <BRK>hopkins pointed to his gut and mimed falling backward   and i just lost it   he said   it took me off my game  suddenly i m trying to just kill the guy  <BRK>he mimicked the wild haymaker he threw in response <BRK> i even tried to kick him  <BRK>he said he wa telling this story because that fight wa just like the oregon game   we got hit fat   he said   we had adversity  thing weren t going right  bam  we got taken out of our game  and a much a the coach tried to get the team back to who we are and what we need to do  sometimes you are going to lose that composure  now  going forward this seaon  we have to get it back  <BRK>hopkins is    too old to throw haymaker  instead  he ha spent two season leading the husky to a complete turnaround <BRK>wahington wa     and lost   conference game in      it soured fan and got the longtime coach lorenzo romar fired  hopkins took over the team  and last week wa named pacific   coach of the year for the second time in his two season <BRK>washington still get knocked down   it advanced to the pac   tournament final last weekend only to lose to oregon   point   but  like it coach  it ha learned how to get up  the pac   is also famously weak this year  which explains why washington is a no    seed and also a lowly  st in the widely followed kenpom com ranking <BRK>hopkins ha brought a rarefied energy to seattle   crazy and unpredictable   one of his player described him  admiringly  hopkins    foot   and still fit  is known to run drill alongside his player  he once broke his nose doing it <BRK>along with unbridled enthusiasm  he ha passed along everything he learned in nearly three decade at syracuse  all the story and all the lesson   even the pugilistic one  he is teaching washington from the textbook of championship basketball he read at boeheim s elbow <BRK>but the success ha come with an aching question  when boeheim     is ready to step down  will hopkins return to upstate new york <BRK>the answer is anyone s guess <BRK>hopkins call boeheim his mentor  but the connection is deeper than that  he describes their bond a one between a wise father and an eager to pleae son  it began   year ago  when hopkins left southern california to play at syracuse  unheralded and overlooked compared with his blue chip teammate <BRK>boeheim ha said he thought hopkins might never be more than a role player  hopkins instead blossomed into a hustling starter who wa called the human bruise for his will to sacrifice his body on defense and dive for loose ball  he became one of boeheim s favorite <BRK>not long after graduating in    hopkins returned to syracuse to try coaching  the year turned  hopkins became boeheim s top assistant and ace recruiter  he helped reel in a significant chunk of syracuse s   national championship team <BRK>then came    the orange self imposed a postseaon ban in response to an n c a a  investigation  boeheim wa under fire  syracuse named hopkins a head coach designate  the plan wa straightforward  boeheim would retire after the     seaon  hopkins would take over <BRK>but boeheim never seemed ready to follow the plan   a syracuse spokesman said boeheim declined to be interviewed for this article   and hopkins is so close to boeheim that he would not have been comfortable a head coach had boeheim been pushed out <BRK>boeheim is still at syracuse  with no end to his career in sight  he is even back in the n c a a  tournament again <BRK>but a hopkins approached    he knew that he had to look elsewhere if he wa to fulfill his dream of coaching a team of his own <BRK>one possibility wa wahington  when it athletic director  jennifer cohen  flew to syracuse to interview him  she got a jolt of his patented energy   right there  a we re meeting   she said   he s talking about his vision for what he can do  and he s so excited that he drop down to the ground and start doing push ups <BRK> let s just put it this way  it wa something i d never seen before in that setting  but it wa also perfect  it showed the hunger he ha  the edge  the energy  <BRK>hopkins took over the husky in march    without an exploratory visit to the campus  it just felt right  he said   almost at a spiritual level   he had deep seattle root  his mother wa born in the area  his father grew up a mile from campus and attended wahington  cousin lived nearby  even his favorite band  pearl jam  hail from seattle <BRK>in their first seaon under hopkins  the husky discovered cohesion   particularly a they unfurled a syracuse inspired zone defense   and because his excitement is contagious  fan began returning  seattle started buzzing about college baketball in a way that it hadn t in year <BRK>last season  the husky finished     and made it to the second round of the national invitation tournament  this season  feasting on the many struggling team in the pac    washington       ha been even better <BRK>hopkins s team won the conference s regular seaon handily  matisse thybulle  a lithe senior guard  broke gary payton s conference record for career steal and wa named the pac   defensive player of the year  jaylen nowell  a sophomore guard  led the team in scoring and got the nod a pac   player of the year <BRK> this is the new season   hopkins said  speaking of the conference tournament and then the n c a a  tournament  which the husky will open with a game against utah state on friday  there are always  upset  and so much drama and competition   he said  adding   we want to play good basketball  that s the bottom line  we ve got a really good team that for a long period of time ha been playing great  and we need to get back to that  <BRK>over dinner on a recent evening at the seafood restaurant where hopkins host a husky basketball radio show  he spoke about his new job and his old one   and about boeheim <BRK>hopkins said they don t talk much during the seaon  they don t need to  not a close a they are  hopkins said he know what boeheim is thinking the way a son know his father s thought <BRK>doe boeheim watch the husky play <BRK> i know he doe   hopkins said   i know it  i know it  i know it  i know it  i know he watch  and i know what he is saying  <BRK>is he still driven to make boeheim proud <BRK>he nodded  yes  exactly   syracuse raised me   he said   it s a simple a that  there s no getting around it  <BRK>he also know that when boeheim finish his reign  speculation will increase that hopkins will bolt for syracuse   or maybe sooner  to another high profile coaching job <BRK>hopkins put down a taco and named some coach he admires  boeheim  of course  at syracuse for   year  mike krzyzewski  at duke for   year   hopkins wa a krzyzewski assistant on team u s a  s olympic gold medal team in   and     mark few  at gonzaga  now for   year <BRK>each took a foundering program  built it to prominence and stayed for the long haul  hopkins vowed to do the same thing in seattle  he hope to make his first national splash this month in the n c a a  tournament  next year s recruiting class look to be one of washington s best <BRK> for me  i think if there is something that i like  i stick with it   he said   if i like some item of clothing  i might buy two or three  and i stick with it  if i like something at a restaurant  i come back and order it again  that s how i m built  i would say   never say never   but when i came to washington  i came to create my own legacy  that s what is important to me <BRK> build something special  with all of your thought and all of your dream  and that s what we re doing right now  <BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK>
