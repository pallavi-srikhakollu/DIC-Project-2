 <BRK>  <BRK> on pro basketball <BRK> by scott cacciola <BRK> charlotte  n c    stephen curry wa about   minute into a news conference here on saturday afternoon when a magician who go the name jibrizy sidled up to the dais to do a card trick  curry  the golden state warrior point guard  seemed impressed  <BRK>  that wa nice  big fella   curry said   that wa crazy  y all see that  did y all see that  what s your name  bos  jibrizy  nice to meet you  man  fire  you re fire  that s what s up   <BRK> lot of weird stuff tends to happen during n b a  all star weekend  and a cameo jibrizy wa no exception  but it wa also the rare instance when the spotlight left curry  if only for a moment  in the run up to the weekend s flagship game on sunday  <BRK> curry  a six time all star and two time most valuable player who ha already coaxed golden state to three championship  is used to lot of attention  but he relished his return to charlotte  where he grew up to become perhaps the greatest shooter of all time   and where he is still revered  <BRK>  from the time i started playing basketball at    right down the street at the recreation center  to now  a lot ha happened   curry said   a lot of great thing   <BRK> curry wa not so great sunday  but that wa not the point  he finished with   point    rebound and   assist for team giannis in a     loss to team lebron in the all star game  which wa a defense free postscript to a weekend that wa a curry family affair  <BRK>  incredibly fond of the family   commissioner adam silver told reporter   they seem to be the first family of charlotte  at least this week   <BRK> for much of his trip home  curry wa accompanied his father  dell  who spent   season playing for the charlotte hornet  and his mother  sonya  who drilled a half court heave after the family helped refurbish a community center  it wa probably the family s splashiest shot of the weekend  <BRK>  i wa surprised   stephen curry said   because the first four she flung underhand  they didn t make it to the rim  and then that last one  it just looked good from the moment it left her hand  and i wa going   wham  bam  can of ham  that s going in     <BRK> curry had le success in saturday night s   point shootout  where he wa joined his younger brother  seth  who play for the portland trail blazer  stephen curry made it to the championship round before losing to joe harris of the brooklyn net  <BRK> but curry had also found time to return to davidson college  his alma mater  where he clambered into the student section to celebrate an     victory over st  joseph s on friday night  <BRK>  the energy in the building wa unbelievable   curry said   it s surreal every time i get to go back there   <BRK> the following afternoon  curry swayed in a sea of reporter  and at leat one magician  a he fielded a wide ranging mix of question  <BRK> what did it mean to him to be back in charlotte   it s kind of overwhelming to be honest   he said   i ve got to be like the energizer bunny   <BRK> could he say something nice to all his fan in the dominican republic   i ve been there  and i hope to go back   he said  <BRK> did he have a favorite basketball themed movie   probably  love   basketball     he said   i m a romantic  bro   <BRK> during warm ups for sunday s game  curry mimicked a game of volleyball with philadelphia  er center joel embiid  posted up a ball boy so that he could take an entry pas from oklahoma city thunder point guard russell westbrook  made chitchat with bigwig who were courtside and jacked his share of   footer  most of them went in  all star weekend is a circus  but it is still basketball  after all  and curry ha unique skill  <BRK> he is assembling another spectacular season  even if his work ha been overshadowed fellow all star like james harden of the houston rocket  paul george of the thunder and milwaukee s giannis antetokounmpo  curry ha been so consistently good for so long now   and his team so dominant   that perhaps some of the novelty ha worn off  it is unfair  of course  <BRK> if his feat feel too familiar  consider his production this season      point      assist and     rebound per game while shooting     percent from the field and     percent from   point range  he missed   game with a groin injury but spent part of that time gluing the warrior  locker room back together after kevin durant and draymond green had a big dust up  <BRK> the friction stemmed from durant s looming free agency  which ha been a steady hum of distraction for the warrior  but curry ha been a stabilizing force for his team   and even for the league  <BRK> with a contract that run through the     season  curry ha not had to face pressing question about his future  he is committed to the warrior  and the warrior appear committed to him  he is a throwback in an era dominated player movement  the current face of which is anthony davis  the all star center who recently requested a trade from the new orleans pelican  so many other star face uncertain summer  too  durant  kyrie irving and kawhi leonard among them  <BRK> but curry ha his niche in northern california  even if his root are in north carolina  after sunday s game  he described trying to persuade his father to move to the bay area  where curry ha settled in with his wife  ayesha  and their three child  <BRK> dell curry  who is a color commentator for the hornet  always say no  <BRK>  this is where home is for him   stephen curry said  <BRK> and for stephen curry  the whereabouts of his father seem to be the only player movement on his mind  curry said he wa unconcerned with free agency this summer and the potential departure of his teammate  <BRK>  that s a part of the business   curry said   but the great team  the great player  they stay in the moment and they understand what s in front of them   <BRK> and so  after taking a weekend to dip into his past  curry returned to looking ahead  the journey go on  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
