<BRK>stephen curry s dazzling pregame shooting session have become a dynaty of their own throughout a half decade of dominance for the golden state warrior  dribbling two ball at once  swish after swish from step inside the half court stripe  gap worthy fling from a tunnel that lead to the bowel of oracle arena  a the warrior chae a fourth championship in five seaons  curry s signature array of warm up shot and trick  and the crowd they draw  stand a baketball s answer to a must see round of barry bond s batting practice <BRK>lesser known is curry s routine before the routine  which he plan to uphold in every game of the n b a  playoff   especially when the warrior are on the road <BRK> get off the bus  walk into the locker room  put my stuff down  go straight to the popcorn table   curry said <BRK>wardell stephen curry ii  you see  is a self professed  popcorn addict  <BRK>he is the first to concede that this disclosure clash with the trend of an n b a  that ha never been more health conscious  but it is the one vice that the warrior  offensive heartbeat regularly succumbs to  and considers an essential part of his game night experience   if it s really good  i m eating it before the game  at halftime and after   curry said <BRK>getting a prescription for contact lens recently  after year of what he described a  blurry vision   helped curry shoot     percent from the   point line in his final   game this seaon   nearly a   percentage point increae over his   point shooting in all   prior game this seaon  yet when aked what would play a bigger role in his postseaon success   popcorn or his new contact   curry scuffled for an answer <BRK> it s  a and  b   he said <BRK>curry s love of a snack synonymous with movie watching go  way  way back  to his youth  his father  dell curry  who enjoyed a   seaon career a an n b a  sharpshooter before becoming a broadcater with the charlotte hornet  is another popcorn devotee and suspect that his eldest son inherited the addiction along with some of dad s marksmanship <BRK>the elder curry frequently rush home from hornet game to watch stephen and his other son  seth curry of the portland trail blazer  in their west coast game   it s still my favorite snack after game   dell curry said   when i m watching my kid  i ve got popcorn with me  <BRK>the difference  dell curry said  is that he would never have considered eating buttered and salted popcorn before playing an n b a  game  ditto for warrior coach steve kerr  another sharpshooter from dell curry s era  over the past decade  food commonly found at the concession stand have become taboo in n b a  pregame fueling  today s more acceptable fare  energy bar  deli meat and peanut butter and jelly sandwich that cover training table in every arena <BRK>but the green light kerr extends to stephen curry  to shoot from anywhere at any time  cover his diet a well <BRK> whatever he is doing  he need to continue to do   kerr said   that is my advice  <BRK>bruce fraer is the golden state asistant coach who ha served a the setup man for curry s pregame shooting show since kerr became the warrior  coach entering the     seaon  it s fraer s theory  a perhaps the organization s keenest curry observer  that curry s attachment to popcorn stem from his numerous childhood trip to n b a  game to watch his father play <BRK> i would think it s a big part of helping him feel like he s in an arena  which for steph is home   fraser said <BRK>curry s popcorn devotion ha grown so deep that over the past year he ha proclaimed in multiple interview that he maintained his own  power ranking  of the offering at all   n b a  arena  asked the new york time earlier this season if he wa prepared to officially compile a   to   ladder for publication  curry not only agreed but also suggested scoring five factor on a scale of   to   to support the ranking  freshness  saltiness  crunchiness  butter and presentation <BRK>steph curry rank the popcorn at all   n b a  arena<BRK>for the purity of the pastime  curry said  he never add anything to the popcorn to change it appearance  taste or temperature  he also said he  can visualize where the popcorn is  in any arena on the n b a  map <BRK> and then the experience come right back   curry said   it s sick  bro  it s a problem  <BRK>he spoke with reverence of the dedicated case of fresh popcorn that the dallas maverick had waiting for him just a quick left turn inside the visitor  locker room at american airline center on jan     curry scored   point that night <BRK>he proudly told the story of miami heat ball boy  at the morning shootaround on feb     assuring him that he would be  impressed their effort on the popcorn front    and then being greeted later that evening a table with popcorn bag lined up on wood plank under heat lamp <BRK>the warrior  annual trip to brooklyn is always circled on his calendar  curry said  because of the care matthew horton  the   foot   visiting locker room attendant at barclays center known a tiny  take to have two serving of fresh popcorn waiting in his locker  barclays  popcorn finished second in curry s ranking  right between no    dalla and no    miami <BRK>although the popcorn at the new orleans pelican  smoothie king center landed just outside the top   at no     warrior staffer still talk about the trip there in curry s second n b a  season  upon discovering an oversize bag of popcorn in the training room  curry moved the bag to his locker and slipped his jersey over it  he wa later pictured hugging the bag  without the jersey  on the locker room floor <BRK> i really get off on popcorn   curry said   it s not even a joke  <BRK>curry s longtime splash brother backcourt mate  klay thompson  noticed him filling out the team by team popcorn ballot on a recent warrior team flight   and found the scene completely normal   he s a popcorn snob   thompson said <BRK>kerr give curry so much latitude that  he insisted  he wa unaware of his star guard s popcorn habit until a reporter told him  yet they are a mild source of strain between curry and the warrior  athletic training staff  because popcorn is not a food item approved of or made available for the team at large before home game <BRK>curry is thus forced to take special measure upon arrival at oracle arena on game night  his go to move is checking in with the security guard norm davis  who is stationed at the door to the warrior  inner sanctum  and asking davis if he s  got some of that good stuff   davis will then send dwight pruitt  another security guard  to the nearby owner s suite to get a freshly popped bag <BRK>the team the warrior play on the road  contrast  never create such a struggle   they want u to fatten up a little before the game   curry said <BRK>curry know he shouldn t be eating a much popcorn a he doe  which is why he force himself to restrict his consumption at home  he described movie popcorn a  the goat  but said he permit himself to go to the theater only  about four time a year  <BRK>of course  when you ve helped lead your team to three title in four season while winning two most valuable player award and becoming one of the most popular player on the planet like curry ha  you have the juice to get away with some thing average player don t  curry wa awarded a four year     million maximum contract the warrior in july     without any popcorn restriction <BRK> that would be a non starter   curry said   they just know it s not a conversation worth having  <BRK> i down it with water   lot and lot of water   curry added  wearing the mischievous look of one of his daughter pleading for a later bedtime   it s not overwhelming at all  i have a high tolerance for popcorn  <BRK>curry doe not always get his way when it come to his favorite treat  at the   all star game in los angeles at staple center   home to what curry  the way  rank a the league s most unappetizing popcorn   he wa caught on camera on the bench in the third quarter munching on a fresh batch out of a box   the power that be came and took it out of my hand   curry said  referring to two league official who told him it wa a bad look amid live play to be eating popcorn   even during a game that doen t count <BRK>yet resistance to such optic may be softening  dr  andy barr  who founded california based innovate performance after stint on the athletic training staff of the knicks and new york city f c  of major league soccer  noted that the psychological benefit curry gain from a snack he enjoys so much could well offset any physiological concern <BRK> if that s the routine and you can t question the performance  there s no harm in it   barr said   popcorn is light  it s salty  but it s not a heavy substance  it s more about the quantity and if he s well hydrated <BRK> if there wa an issue with performance or diet relating to body composition or an energy problem  then maybe you would take some issue with it  but it can t all be straight performance food  with the grind of an n b a  season  sometimes you have to have a little bit of lenience with thing  <BRK>said curry   i consider it a factor in my overall enjoyment of playing in a road environment  if your popcorn is bad  it affect my mood  <BRK>told that it sound a though popcorn should actually be clasified a his favorite food  curry said   i know i can t live off it  but yeah  <BRK><BRK>
