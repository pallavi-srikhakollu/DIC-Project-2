 <BRK>  <BRK> gonzaga    florida state   <BRK> by billy witz <BRK> anaheim  calif    the sweat had not yet dried on the brow of gonzaga s basketball player after they dispatched baylor last weekend  but their gaze turned quickly to what lay ahead   a chance to rewrite last season s ending  <BRK> it wa clear that they had checked carefully when the n c a a  men s basketball tournament bracket were announced  and knew they could again be facing florida state in the same round  a west region semifinal  and amid the same freeway system  greater los angeles  where their season ended a year ago  <BRK>  we can t wait to get revenge   forward corey kispert said  expressing a sentiment that wa present up and down the roster  <BRK> the zag may have been bullied   and not quite at full strength   last season  but they stood firm enough on thursday night  turning back the rugged  determined seminole       to advance to the west region final on saturday against third seeded texas tech  which dominated second seeded michigan       <BRK> it is hard to imagine that game being more taxing for the no    seeded zag than the one against fourth seeded florida state  <BRK> though the seminole  who had lost only to north carolina and duke over the last two month  were short handed  climbing uphill and fighting foul trouble all night  they persisted nevertheless  <BRK> the physical play appeared to grind the zag down  a they seemed le interested in moving their foot and began reaching more on defense  and their offensive diversity and ball movement were reduced to seeking out their n b a  prospect  rui hachimura and brandon clarke  <BRK>  it s march  and we knew adversity would hit   gonzaga s josh perkins said   it didn t happen early  but it happened   <BRK> a much of a slog a it wa for gonzaga  it victory wa a materpiece compared with the game that followed here in anaheim  perhaps this wa to be expected with the nation s two most efficient defensive team  but still  fourteen minute into the game  texa tech led michigan      <BRK> and while the red raider eventually found some rhythm  particularly jarrett culver    point  and davide moretti    point   the wolverine  shooting never progressed beyond abysmal  michigan  which went to the title game last year and lost to villanova  missed it first     point attempt and did not make a jump shot until     remained  shortly after  matt mooney took a pas from culver and sank a   pointer  extending the red raider  lead to   point and ensuring there would be no late drama  <BRK> in the earlier game  a a   point gonzaga lead wa sliced to     with   minute   second left  the zag steadied themselves on a sequence at each end of the court  killian tillie  who wa injured when these team met a year ago  harased the seminole  devin vasell on a drive to the baket and zach norvell jr  came up with a   pointer to push the zag  margin to    florida state never challenged again  <BRK>  he hit a big shot   florida state s mfiondu kabengele said of norvell   you ve got to give him credit   <BRK> hachimura scored   point and clarke added   point    rebound and   block for gonzaga  which also got four   pointer from norvell  trent forrest led florida state with   point  <BRK> it had been a whirlwind week for the seminole  who were without a senior leader  phil cofer  whose father died a week ago  <BRK> cofer  who had injured his foot in the atlantic coast conference tournament  learned of his father s death when he returned to the locker room after the seminole  first round n c a a  win against vermont  his teammate found out when he broke down in tear  coach leonard hamilton wa summoned from the interview room  and the news medium wa cleared from the locker room  <BRK> cofer returned home and ha been with his family since  though it wa unclear if he would be able to return from the injury  he told his teammate that he would be with them if they reached the final four  <BRK> that became a clarion call for the seminole  <BRK>  when we saw phil hurting  it hurt u   p j savoy  a fellow senior  said on wednesday   jut knowing that he s not going to be here this week give u that extra purpose of what we re playing for  so i jut feel like we ve got to go out and win for him   <BRK> being without cofer   one of the team s leader   wa not the only shortcoming the seminole faced on thursday  their spindly   foot   center  christ koumadje  wa in foul trouble all night  he played le than three minute in the first half before picking up two quick foul  with him out  gonzaga took an   point halftime lead  he got his third le than three minute into the second half   and with the seminole trailing      hamilton had no choice but to leave him in  <BRK> but koumadje could be only so careful  when hachimura made three pump fake  koumadje bit on the final one and wa whistled for his fourth foul with     to play  <BRK> a minute later  savoy went to the bench with what looked like a severe shoulder injury  though he returned in the final minute  but no one   not savoy  koumadje or terance mann  who had   point against the zag last year but wa   for   on thursday    could carry the seminole all the way back  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
