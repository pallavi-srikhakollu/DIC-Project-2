serendipit choic merg with hard work  alari  a multital two way player of the kind sought at the profession level  did not tower over her peer when she was grow up  she rememb be onli a bit taller than them but say she cannot recal a time when she did not have a basketbal in her hand <BRK>her father  mark  a former duke and n b a  player  set about make sure she could play at ani posit <BRK> i think a lot of it was realli focus on my guard skill   bella alari said   i think my dad knew that from a young age  that develop skill earli would realli benefit me in the long run  we didn t realli know how tall i would be  so i m realli lucki that i kept grow  <BRK>her slight build meant that dure her high school career at nation cathedr school in washington  she drew interest from ivi leagu

the best in the countri   alari said   and against the best in the world at my age  so i think that summer realli boost my confid in myself as a player and also expand my game  and i learn how to play in anoth system  <BRK>her coach took note of it and has turn alari into a true hybrid  she has been use more in the post after ad   pound to her frame without forsak her guard skill  that make her an intrigu pro prospect for a leagu domin player like elena dell donn and breanna stewart  who have size and the abil to play ani posit <BRK>oppos coach have notic  too <BRK> i love her   toni bozzella  the seton hall coach  said  alari had   point and   rebound last year in a princeton win at seton hall   remind me of dell donn  not as good yet  but similar game  obvious a great scorer in mani way  awesom rebound and passer  great vision  supersmart  a definit first round pick  <BRK>this season  after miss princeton s first nine game with a broken arm  alari is put up number seldom seen at the school  she set the ivi leagu s singl game score mark last month with a   point outing against columbia  and in the process becam the onli princeton player other than bill bradley to score at least

without her  enter the weekend  the tiger were     with alari  unfortun for oppon  after she broke her right arm she spent her recoveri time work aggress on go to her left  make her even harder to stop <BRK>while w n b a  team cannot comment on alari public  scout and execut are track her  as one put it   she s on radar   they have let her coach know it  too <BRK> i talk to w n b a  coach all the time about her   banghart said   so certain  she s no secret to the w n b a  <BRK>princeton s program has generat other pro talent  blake dietrick  the ivi leagu player of the year in      went on
