<BRK><BRK>by howard megdal<BRK>bella alarie ha become a must see player for the princeton woman s basketball team  it s something her coach  courtney banghart  ha known for a while  but the rest of the world is just finding out <BRK>banghart began to sense that more people were becoming aware of her star player during a recent conversation with chris young  the former major league pitcher who played basketball and baseball at princeton <BRK> he go   i d pay to watch two player in college basketball  zion williamson and bella alarie     banghart said <BRK>almost every basketball fan know williamson  duke s top player and probably the n b a  s next top draft pick  but alarie  she is a   foot   junior who ha developed into a player capable of lifting the tiger to national prominence  on saturday  against cornell in the semifinal of the ivy league tournament  she grabbed eight rebound and scored a game high   point  shooting   of   from the field  in a     victory to advance to the final <BRK>observer believe she ha a chance to do something no ivy league player ha done since allison feaster  who graduated from harvard in    represent the conference in an extended w n b a  career <BRK>this development wa le a dedicated plan and more a series of serendipitous choice merged with hard work  alarie  a multitalented two way player of the kind sought at the professional level  did not tower over her peer when she wa growing up  she remembers being only a bit taller than them but say she cannot recall a time when she did not have a basketball in her hand <BRK>her father  mark  a former duke and n b a  player  set about making sure she could play at any position <BRK> i think a lot of it wa really focusing on my guard skill   bella alarie said   i think my dad knew that from a young age  that developing skill early would really benefit me in the long run  we didn t really know how tall i would be  so i m really lucky that i kept growing  <BRK>her slight build meant that during her high school career at national cathedral school in wahington  she drew interest from ivy league team  including harvard and penn  but did not get so much a a letter of interest from her father s alma mater  anything beyond playing in college wa not on her radar when she arrived at princeton <BRK> in high school  i never really thought of myself a someone who would achieve the thing i have so far in college   alarie said   and when i wa getting recruited  i did really want to put an emphais on getting a really well rounded college experience  the ivy league i wa really drawn to from the beginning  princeton  penn and harvard   those were definitely the school it came down to  <BRK>thing began to change for alarie after she won ivy league freshman of the year honor  then wa selected to play for u s a  basketball in the under   fiba world cup <BRK> to make that team  that really proved to me that i could compete with some of the best in the country   alarie said   and against the best in the world at my age  so i think that summer really boosted my confidence in myself a a player and also expanded my game  and i learned how to play in another system  <BRK>her coach took note of it and ha turned alarie into a true hybrid  she ha been used more in the post after adding   pound to her frame without forsaking her guard skill  that make her an intriguing pro prospect for a league dominated player like elena delle donne and breanna stewart  who have size and the ability to play any position <BRK>opposing coach have noticed  too <BRK> i love her   tony bozzella  the seton hall coach  said  alarie had   point and   rebound lat year in a princeton win at seton hall   reminds me of delle donne  not a good yet  but similar game  obviously a great scorer in many way  awesome rebounder and paser  great vision  supersmart  a definite first round pick  <BRK>this season  after missing princeton s first nine game with a broken arm  alarie is putting up number seldom seen at the school  she set the ivy league s single game scoring mark last month with a   point outing against columbia  and in the process became the only princeton player other than bill bradley to score at least   <BRK>entering this weekend s ivy league tournament at yale  alarie wa averaging     point and     rebound a game  and shooting   percent from the field  with range extending beyond the arc <BRK>on the defensive end  according to synergy sport data  she wa allowing opponent     point per possession  which ranked her  th in the country among     division i player with at least   defensive possession <BRK>accordingly  princeton wa     without her  entering the weekend  the tiger were     with alarie  unfortunately for opponent  after she broke her right arm she spent her recovery time working aggressively on going to her left  making her even harder to stop <BRK>while w n b a  team cannot comment on alarie publicly  scout and executive are tracking her  a one put it   she s on radar   they have let her coach know it  too <BRK> i talk to w n b a  coach all the time about her   banghart said   so certainly  she s no secret to the w n b a  <BRK>princeton s program ha generated other pro talent  blake dietrick  the ivy league player of the year in      went on to play for the atlanta dream last season  leslie robinson  whose father  craig  wa a two time player of the year at princeton in the early  s  wa drafted the liberty in the third round of last season s w n b a  draft <BRK>dietrick credited the success of the program a a whole   i would not have had nearly a much w n b a  interest were it not for the success of my team and our     seaon   she said  referring to princeton s regular seaon record in      but she also credited her coach for working to improve the player within the team context and with an eye on long term success <BRK>to banghart  it wa no different from the way she would treat any other high achieving princeton student <BRK> if someone s interested in finance  i connect them to the people they think they can learn from   banghart said   with bella  it s the same thing  the more positionless she can be  the better she can be  there s an eye on helping her at princeton  and there s an eye on being the best pro she can be at what she chooses  so i m thinking big picture with her because she deserves it  she s earned it
