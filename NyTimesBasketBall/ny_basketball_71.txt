 <BRK>  <BRK> virginia    texas tech     overtime <BRK> by billy witz <BRK> minneapolis   a year after exiting the court a a picture of embarrasment  the first no    seed to lose to a no    in the men s n c a a  tournament  virginia left wearing a crown on monday night  <BRK> the cavalier defeated texas tech       in overtime for the university s first national basketball championship  which carried with it immeasurable redemption  <BRK>  forget last year   virginia s ty jerome said   this is everything you dream of since you re a little kid   <BRK> this title game wa the first in   year between men s team that had never been there before  the last one wa the showdown in which magic johnson s michigan state team beat larry bird and indiana state in salt lake city  <BRK> monday night s game did not offer anything near that level of star power  instead  viewer got a matchup of team that rely on a throwback style of play   methodical offense  lunch pail defense and roster long on experience  <BRK> with a pair of pulverizing defense and coach who demanded diligent shot selection  the game began in sync with expectation   a something that looked like three dribble and a cloud of sawdust  five minute in  that had produced a baeball score       in favor of texa tech  and it took the red raider more than seven minute to score their first field goal  <BRK> but the game quickly morphed into one for the age  a the team traded shot after shot down the stretch and into overtime until the red raider could deliver no more  <BRK>  every time i thought we had it  they made a shot or made a play   texa tech s matt mooney said afterward  barely audible and staring at the ground a he sat at his locker   it wa a battle  we threw a punch  they threw a punch  they came right back at u every time   <BRK> it wa fitting that a de andre hunter   pointer from the corner  with   minute   second left in overtime  put the cavalier ahead for good       <BRK> hunter  who missed last year s tournament with a broken wrist  carried virginia at both end of the court  harassing the texas tech star jarrett culver into   for   shooting and shrugging off his own struggle in the first half to finish with a career high   point  <BRK> the cavalier  who needed some miraculous moment to arrive here   a shot flicked into the basket at the buzzer mamadi diakite to carry them into overtime against purdue and kyle guy s steel nerved free throw with six tenth of a second left to carry them past auburn in saturday s semifinal   got some more on monday night  <BRK> with   second left in regulation play on monday  hunter took a pas from jerome  who had penetrated into the lane  and knocked down a tying   pointer from the corner  in front of the virginia bench  <BRK> it wa a particularly crushing shot for texas tech  <BRK> the red raider had crept back from a   point deficit midway through the second half  and they did so without much help from tariq owen  the starting forward who sprained his right ankle on saturday and then received round the clock treatment and a painkilling shot to try to get through the title game  owen played just   minute  <BRK> still  when norense odiae sank two free throw with   second left to put texa tech ahead      the red raider were right where they wanted to be   turning to their defense  rated kenpom a the best in the nation  <BRK>  i thought we just needed one more stop   odiase said   we pride ourselves on getting stop like that  i thought it wa over   <BRK> but a jerome drove into the lane  culver left hunter to help  and mooney neglected to rotate off kihei clark  the freshman guard who is a reluctant shooter  <BRK>  i wa thinking i have to make this   said hunter  who missed seven of eight shot in the first half and scored   point in the second   that s exactly what i said in my head  i shot it  it felt good  it wa on a line  and it went in   <BRK> texas tech had been rescued to that point brandone francis  who scored   point off the bench  and some heroic play from odiase down the stretch  and though culver came alive offensively late  scoring   point and delivering five assist and three block  he could not deliver quite enough  he missed two shot in the final second of regulation   the first with hunter contesting   that would have delivered an unlikely title for texas tech  which wa unranked at the start of the season  <BRK> hunter also had a hand in a pivotal defensive play in overtime  knocking the ball away from davide moretti and out of bound with     remaining and virginia clinging to a     lead  the official ruled that the ball had gone off hunter  who raked moretti across the arm  but the call wa overturned after a replay review  and the ball went to virginia  <BRK> jerome made two foul shot with   second left  and virginia  which made all   of it free throw attempt in overtime  never gave the ball back to texas tech with a chance for it to tie  <BRK> to win the championship  virginia not only had to fend off the determined red raider and win thriller against purdue and auburn  it also had to beat back ghost from last year   when it wa stunned the university of maryland  baltimore county   and many question about whether coach tony bennett s methodical system wa suited to championship basketball  <BRK> bennett  whose father  dick  took wisconsin to the final four in    had built virginia into a powerhouse during his   year at the university but had advanced beyond the first weekend of the n c a a tournament only twice before this season  <BRK> last season s disappointment stung like no other  <BRK> it lingered below the surface all season for the cavalier  who promised that they would be better for the experience  <BRK> guy  a starting guard  ha used a photo of himself  bent over with his head in his hand while u m b c  player celebrated around him  a his twitter avatar for the lat year  and when a reporter recently apologized for aking a question about that game  guy told him it wa not necessary  <BRK>  if you have a conflict  try to hit it head on   guy  who scored   point  explained on sunday   that s the only way you re going to get past it  and that s something that i ve learned over the year  if you shy away from it  that s where sometimes your anxiety will come in and haunt you  so i just wanted to hit it head on   <BRK> and so the cavalier did  and at the end of their redemptive journey  they learned what it wa like to embrace something much more comforting   a gleaming trophy  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
