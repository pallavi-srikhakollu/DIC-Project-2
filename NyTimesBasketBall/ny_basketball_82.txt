 <BRK>  <BRK> by kelly whiteside <BRK> the poet and the point guard have never met  but they see the parallel in their craft   the push pull between creativity and pragmatism  between daring and safe  <BRK> before this season  mikko harvey  an award winning poet long enamored of the playing style of d angelo russell  wondered if the net would ever find a place for their new point guard  whose imaginative play can vacillate between the beautiful and the boneheaded  <BRK> do you throw the no look pas for beauty s sake when a practical pas would do  <BRK> do you write poetry or paint portrait when just about any other career is the more prudent choice  <BRK>  rooting for d angelo seems like a vote for art and a vote for imagination and a vote for whimsy   harvey said  if that s the case  whimsy is winning  at    russell will play in his first n b a  all star game on sunday  <BRK> harvey began rooting for russell when they were at ohio state five year ago   harvey a a graduate student  russell a a freshman for the buckeye  harvey fell in love with the artistry of the point guard s play  <BRK> watching russell is like seeing a skateboarder midair  soaring through a series of dizzying flip and twist  harvey said   you hold your breath wondering whether or not he s going to land it   <BRK> when told of the analogy  russell nodded   i can relate   he said   it s risk versus reward  i play freely  almost with an edge taking what the defense give  but also taking what i want  and that s either a tough shot that go in or a tough pas that get through  it can either be a turnover or an air ball  <BRK>  there s a balance  i think that s where my success ha come from  finding that balance this season  but for coach  it can be hair pulling  turning it over too many time or trying to make a home run pas or shot too many time   <BRK> so far  the risk is paying off  russell ha become the leader of a team that ha exceeded expectation  at      the net have surpassed last season s victory total with le than a third of the regular season schedule remaining  <BRK> in his fourth season in the league  russell his found success staying true to his inner artist while operating within the net system  through   game  he ha averaged career high in point        assist        field goal percentage          point field goal percentage       and free throw percentage        <BRK>  there is a creative gene that he ha   net coach kenny atkinson said   artist drive you crazy sometime because they want to keep expanding  and there ha to be a discipline  sometime  he get too creative  his biggest strength can be a weakness  but his creativity and our structure have become a good marriage  the more i ve gotten to know him  the more i let him be more creative  sure  i can get upset at time  but i m going towards giving that kid more freedom   <BRK> though russell s crafty play have outweighed the knuckleheaded one this season  there are time when atkinson want to pull out fistful of hair  in october against new orleans  with the net ahead a point with     second left  russell glanced left  knowing caris levert wa to his right  his no look pas sailed far beyond levert s reach and out of bound  and the pelican went on to win  <BRK>  i wasn t no looking just to no look   russell said  adding that he miscalculated the speed of the cut   but i should have been looking   <BRK> more recently against boston  with the net behind    atkinson sat russell for the final   minute   second  even though the point guard had scored   point in   minute  after russell loafed on two rebound attempt and turned the ball over twice  atkinson pulled him for what he called a  teachable moment   <BRK> after the loss  russell accepted responsibility without complaint  a sign of his growth since coming to the net  <BRK> russell s leadership skill now are mile from the immaturity that plagued his rookie seaon with the los angeles lakers  who drafted him a the second overall pick in    that year  he made a secret recording of his teammate nick young admitting to cheating on his fianc√©e at the time  the rapper iggy azalea  the video became public  young and azalea broke up  and locker room dysfunction followed  after two seaons  the lakers traded russell to the net  <BRK>  d angelo is an excellent player   magic johnson  the lakers  president  told reporter in   after introducing rusell s replacement  lonzo ball   he ha the talent to be an all star  we want to thank him for what he did for u  but what i needed wa a leader  i needed somebody also that can make the other player better and also that player want to play with   <BRK> russell ha become precisely what johnson desired  an all star  a leader and someone who make those around him better  <BRK>  he make it fun to play because he make game a lot easier   forward joe harris said   he s a cerebral player  if someone doesn t get a touch  he s thinking about how to get them in rhythm   <BRK> on a recent trip  while the rest of the team wa napping on the plane  atkinson tapped russell on the shoulder and told him that he had been named an all star   russell would be a reserve  replacing the injured victor oladipo  russell held back tear  <BRK>  going into the season  i don t think anyone  myself included  thought i d be an all star   russell said   i feel like what i ve been through in the league  i ve learned when you focus and buy into your craft  all of a sudden you look up and good thing happen   <BRK> and with the good come something else  pressure  <BRK> like most net fan  harvey  the poet  is thrilled with the team s success but also filled with other shoe drop anxiety  a the net inch closer to a playoff spot  what if the trap door open and they fall closer to the cellar  or what if russell regress  <BRK>  even when thing are going well  i m so used to them falling apart   said harvey     who previously lived in brooklyn  where he taught creative writing and worked a an editorial fellow at poet   writer magazine  <BRK> the poet s fandom left the confines of his imagination last year when in an interview with a canadian literary blog  he wa asked to describe his secret internet obsession  he confessed   i watch his game  read think piece about him on the netsdaily fan website  keep up with his instagram  etc  he occasionally appears in my dream   <BRK> if finding a balance between the daring play and the restrained one is what russell ha learned this season  harvey of course see a parallel to poetry  <BRK>  it s not easy to blend his kind of unpredictable energy into a set system   harvey said   and yet that s one of the beautiful challenge of artmaking  finding way to innovate within structure  a poem can be wildly inventive even while following an  th century rhyme scheme  his creativity really shine when he ha a good system to either fall back on or react against   his imagination ha become much more coherent   <BRK> harvey relies on an essay   the figure a poem make  robert frost  to describe the creative process  it take hard work to become a great artist  but it also requires something mysterious and intuitive  <BRK>  like a piece of ice on a hot stove  the poem must ride on it own melting   frost wrote   a poem may be worked over once it is in being  but may not be worried into being  it most precious quality will remain it having run itelf and carried away the poet with it  read it a hundred time  it will forever keep it freshness a a petal keep it fragrance  it can never lose it sense of a meaning that once unfolded surprise a it went   <BRK> when the word are read to russell  his eye grow wide   i went to robert frost middle school   said russell  who is from louisville  ky   that s fascinating  i like the way he did that  i get it  <BRK>  just a far a the mental process go  when you put word in a poem  you have to think how many outcome the reader will come up with  like robert frost said  it never get old  you can read it a hundred time and it keep it freshness  you can take that over to baketball  your mind can take your game to so many different level  it totally relates   <BRK>  <BRK>
