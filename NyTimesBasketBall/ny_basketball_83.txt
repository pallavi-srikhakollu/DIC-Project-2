<BRK><BRK>by kelli whitesid<BRK>the poet and the point guard have never met  but they see the parallel in their craft   the push pull between creativ and pragmat  between dare and safe <BRK>befor this season  mikko harvey  an award win poet long enamor of the play style of d angelo russel  wonder if the net would ever find a place for their new point guard  whose imagin play can vacil between the beauti and the bonehead <BRK>do you throw the no look pass for beauti s sake when a practic pass would do <BRK>do you write poetri or paint portrait when just about ani other career is the more prudent choic <BRK> root for d angelo seem like a vote for art and a vote for imagin and a vote for whimsi   harvey said  if that s the case  whimsi is win  at    russel will play in his first n b a  all star game on sunday <BRK>harvey began root for russel when they were at ohio state five year ago   harvey as a graduat student  russel as a freshman for the buckey  harvey fell in love with the artistri of the point guard s play <BRK>watch russel is like see a skateboard midair  soar through a seri of dizzi flip and twist  harvey said   you hold your breath wonder whether or not he s go to land it  <BRK>when told of the analog  russel nod   i can relat   he said   it s risk versus reward  i play freeli  almost with an edg take what the defens give  but also take what i want  and that s either a tough shot that goe in or a tough pass that get through  it can either be a turnov or an air ball <BRK> there s a balanc  i think that s where my success has come from  find that balanc this season  but for coach  it can be hair pull  turn it over too mani time or tri to make a home run pass or shot too mani time  <BRK>so far  the risk is pay off  russel has becom the leader of a team that has exceed expect  at      the net have surpass last season s victori total with less than a third of the regular season schedul remain <BRK>in his fourth season in the leagu  russel his found success stay true to his inner artist while oper within the net system  through   game  he has averag career high in point        assist        field goal percentag          point field goal percentag       and free throw percentag       <BRK> there is a creativ gene that he has   net coach kenni atkinson said   artist drive you crazi sometim becaus they want to keep expand  and there has to be a disciplin  sometim  he get too creativ  his biggest strength can be a weak  but his creativ and our structur have becom a good marriag  the more i ve gotten to know him  the more i let him be more creativ  sure  i can get upset at time  but i m go toward give that kid more freedom  <BRK>though russel s crafti play have outweigh the knucklehead one this season  there are time when atkinson want to pull out fist of hair  in octob against new orlean  with the net ahead a point with     second left  russel glanc left  know cari levert was to his right  his no look pass sail far beyond levert s reach and out of bound  and the pelican went on to win <BRK> i wasn t no look just to no look   russel said  ad that he miscalcul the speed of the cut   but i should have been look  <BRK>more recent against boston  with the net behind    atkinson sat russel for the final   minut   second  even though the point guard had score   point in   minut  after russel loaf on two rebound attempt and turn the ball over twice  atkinson pull him for what he call a  teachabl moment  <BRK>after the loss  russel accept respons without complaint  a sign of his growth sinc come to the net <BRK>russel s leadership skill now are mile from the immatur that plagu his rooki season with the los angel laker  who draft him as the second overal pick in    that year  he made a secret record of his teammat nick young admit to cheat on his fianc√© at the time  the rapper iggi azalea  the video becam public  young and azalea broke up  and locker room dysfunct follow  after two season  the laker trade russel to the net <BRK> d angelo is an excel player   magic johnson  the laker  presid  told report in   after introduc russel s replac  lonzo ball   he has the talent to be an all star  we want to thank him for what he did for us  but what i need was a leader  i need somebodi also that can make the other player better and also that player want to play with  <BRK>russel has becom precis what johnson desir  an all star  a leader and someon who make those around him better <BRK> he make it fun to play becaus he make game a lot easier   forward joe harri said   he s a cerebr player  if someon doesn t get a touch  he s think about how to get them in rhythm  <BRK>on a recent trip  while the rest of the team was nap on the plane  atkinson tap russel on the shoulder and told him that he had been name an all star   russel would be a reserv  replac the injur victor oladipo  russel held back tear <BRK> go into the season  i don t think anyon  myself includ  thought i d be an all star   russel said   i feel like what i ve been through in the leagu  i ve learn when you focus and buy into your craft  all of a sudden you look up and good thing happen  <BRK>and with the good come someth els  pressur <BRK>like most net fan  harvey  the poet  is thrill with the team s success but also fill with other shoe drop anxieti  as the net inch closer to a playoff spot  what if the trap door open and they fall closer to the cellar  or what if russel regress <BRK> even when thing are go well  i m so use to them fall apart   said harvey     who previous live in brooklyn  where he taught creativ write and work as an editori fellow at poet   writer magazin <BRK>the poet s fandom left the confin of his imagin last year when in an interview with a canadian literari blog  he was ask to describ his secret internet obsess  he confess   i watch his game  read think piec about him on the netsdaili fan websit  keep up with his instagram  etc  he occasion appear in my dream  <BRK>if find a balanc between the dare play and the restrain one is what russel has learn this season  harvey of cours see a parallel to poetri <BRK> it s not easi to blend his kind of unpredict energi into a set system   harvey said   and yet that s one of the beauti challeng of artmak  find way to innov within structur  a poem can be wild invent even while follow an  th centuri rhyme scheme  his creativ realli shine when he has a good system to either fall back on or react against   his imagin has becom much more coher  <BRK>harvey reli on an essay   the figur a poem make  robert frost  to describ the creativ process  it take hard work to becom a great artist  but it also requir someth mysteri and intuit <BRK> like a piec of ice on a hot stove  the poem must ride on it own melt   frost wrote   a poem may be work over onc it is in be  but may not be worri into be  it most precious qualiti will remain it have run itelf and carri away the poet with it  read it a hundr time  it will forev keep it fresh as a petal keep it fragranc  it can never lose it sens of a mean that onc unfold surpris as it went  <BRK>when the word are read to russel  his eye grow wide   i went to robert frost middl school   said russel  who is from louisvill  ky   that s fascin  i like the way he did that  i get it <BRK> just as far as the mental process goe  when you put word in a poem  you have to think how mani outcom the reader will come up with  like robert frost said  it never get old  you can read it a hundr time and it keep it fresh  you can take that over to basketbal  your mind can take your game to so mani differ level  it total relat  <BRK><BRK>
