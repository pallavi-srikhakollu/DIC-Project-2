level to be reached <BRK>he got there midway through the second half  when he finished an alley oop on a pas from point guard tre jones    point  eight assist  zero turnover  to give the blue devil  who struggled to gain separation from the hard charging hokies  a     lead <BRK> that s a momentum play for u   jones said <BRK>all of williamson s weaponry wa needed  the hokies came out hot  in the first half  they made seven shot from beyond the   point arc  hill    point  six rebound  provided energy  finishing an alley oop on one possession and flexing his right biceps after knocking down a   pointer from the right corner on another <BRK>duke had faced virginia tech short handed lat month  that time williamson wa on the bench  a he missed five game because of a mild knee sprain  virginia

louisiana state until friday s game wa well in hand with a minute left  and michigan state seemed to need of his effort <BRK>winston  a junior point guard who wa the big ten player of the year and the outstanding player of the conference tournament  which michigan state won  marshaled the offense and guarded the tiger  floor general  tremont water  on defense  he finished with   point  taking   shot  including three of michigan state s     pointer  and added   assist <BRK>without him  it might have been close  l s u  s size and physicality seemed to overwhelm michigan state at time  but ultimately  the spartan defeated the tiger       to advance to the regional final for the ninth time in coach tom izzo s   season <BRK> he s my tom brady  in a way   izzo said of winston   change running back and receiver  and he just keep winning  <BRK>michigan state       became the second big ten team in the round of eight  joining purdue <BRK>the spartan came out on a tear  with his team ahead      winston dished to the freshman aaron henry and lifted up the lat three finger on his hand a henry drained the   pointer  henry finished with   point and eight rebound <BRK>on the next possession  it wa winston s turn to make one from deep  l s u  called timeout after michigan state raced to a     lead  in the first half  michigan state went   for   from beyond the arc  for the game  the spartan were   of    a     percent success rate <BRK> first half i thought we were unbelievable on the board  and that wa the difference in the game   izzo said  his team won the rebound battle       in the first half  and     over all <BRK>but l s u         appearing in it first regional semifinal since    roared back  putting up an     run of their own to begin the second half  fueled the sophomore guard water  who led all player with   point <BRK> we knew they were going to make multiple run  just like we did   said winston  adding   we just did our best to keep our composure  <BRK>throughout the game  l s u  played admirable defense against one of the most efficient offense  a the spartan often had to force flailing attempt at the baket a the shot clock ticked <BRK>but it wa not enough  the tiger were     this season when holding their opponent to fewer than   point  in the other game  including this one  they went     <BRK>any life l s u  might have had left wa squeezed out with a little more than   minute left and the tiger trailing    skylar may of l s u  got on a fast break and took the ball in  but nick ward  a junior forward who missed several game this season with a hairline fracture in his left hand  used his right to block may s attempted dunk <BRK>the block turned into a michigan state fast break that culminated in gabe brown s fourth   pointer of the game <BRK>ward later left the game when he went down  seeming to grab his left wrist  after getting an offensive rebound and being fouled hard naz reid  in a rare lapse  winston missed both free throw after the flagrant   foul on reid <BRK>l s u  trailed a few a   point with three minute to go  but the spartan were able to trade bakets from there  with barely   second left  the michigan state senior matt mcquaid took the ball to the rim and made a layup while being fouled  he converted the   point play <BRK>it wa the last of many   point play for the spartan  most of them of the one shot variety  michigan state know that making   in   shot from deep can cover up a lot of imperfection <BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK><BRK>
