maybe they were never going to win a championship this season  even with lebron james  but they were not supposed to be this bad  what happened <BRK>creditcreditharry how getty image<BRK><BRK>by marc stein<BRK>the arrival of lebron james a their latest in a succession of superstar import wa supposed to halt the longest period of suffering in the los angeles lakers  california history <BRK>what james and the lakers have experienced instead will be remembered a the most disappointing seaon of james s career   because it will extend a stubborn playoff drought that ha flummoxed the n b a  s most glamorous franchise <BRK>not even james s presence could prevent a sixth straight missed postseason for the new lakers  who are mere day from being mathematically eliminated from the playoff entering sunday s visit to madison square garden to face the knicks  the lakers  remember  missed the playoff only four time in their first   season after relocating from minneapolis in the     season <BRK>so much for hollywood fairy tale <BRK>perhaps expectation for this team were unrealistically high  given the modest quality of james s supporting cast in year    but his lakerland debut wa never supposed to veer this far off script for a once in a generation player  what follows is a breakdown of how thing fell apart   in six stage <BRK>without warning  on july       the first night of n b a  free agency  james announced through a   word news release that he wa signing a four year     million contract with the lakers <BRK>yet the ensuing celebration did not last even   hour <BRK>on july    golden state boldly swiped some of the lakers  thunder signing the former all star big man demarcus cousin to a bargain deal  the lakers then spent the next week scouring the league for the best player willing to sign one year contract   thereby preserving salary cap flexibility for the summer of   and their planned pursuit of an all star sidekick for james <BRK>the problem  magic johnson and rob pelinka  the lakers  nacent front office power duo  signed a slew of nonshooters and  shall we say  mercurial personality who  a a group  prompted instant second guessing <BRK>the lakers countered the skepticism insisting that playmaker and playoff tested veteran  rather than shooting specialist who could open up space on the floor  would eae lebron s burden and potentially even match up well with the mighty warrior   only to see their signees do little to hush the told you so crowd  javale mcgee  the veteran center  initially exceeded expectation  but the quartet of rajon rondo  lance stephenson  kentavious caldwell pope and michael bealey proved a collectively ineffective a feared <BRK>perhaps we should have known that this wa not going to be the usual lebron season when a fight broke out between a number of lakers and houston rocket in james s first home game at staple center <BRK>and the tension never really let up <BRK>after just eight game   five of them loss   johnson summoned coach luke walton for a pointed lecture about the lakers  sluggish start  the team s legendary point guard turned team president never intended for the meeting or any detail to leak to the news medium  but they promptly did in the no secret world of the n b a <BRK>johnson immediately tried to play down suggestion that walton s job wa already in jeopardy  in an interview with the los angeles time  but he would not go further than proclaiming that walton wa  going to finish the season  unless something drastic happens  which it won t  <BRK>walton is certainly not blameless in the lakers  struggle  his lineup  rotation and responsibility for l a  s worrisome drop to no    leaguewide in offensive efficiency have routinely been questioned  management  furthermore  is said to be dismayed walton s refusal to hire a seaoned former head coach a his top asistant   something young coach  walton is    frequently do <BRK>yet the public nature of the heat walton took from his own front office made johnson look impatient and  worse  ramped up the pressure on everyone in the lakers  locker room   especially the coach   before they even made it to thanksgiving  with two year left on a five year deal  walton is widely expected to be shoved out of his toasty seat for good at season s end <BRK>what can be clasified a the best day of the lakers  seaon  if you only considered the box score  is also bound to be remembered a this seaon s low point <BRK>the lakers went to oakland on christmas day for a game in the most anticipated television time slot on the regular season calendar and throttled the two time defending champion warrior  the     rout capped an     surge that nudged l a  s record to      good for a promising fourth in the dauntingly deep western conference <BRK>but james strained his left groin a he stretched to retrieve a loose ball in the third quarter  the lakers gradually pulled away without him   and james optimistically posted to twitter the next day about how he  dodged a bullet   with a  backinnotime hahtag   but the injury turned out to be the most serious he had ever sustained <BRK>james eventually missed   game  no previous injury had ever sidelined him longer than the eight game he lost to a back injury in      the lakers went     without james and  even accounting for all of their misstep before and after lebron went down  can rightly point to suddenly losing their star a the biggest blow to the team s playoff hope <BRK>it remains unclear how  backinnotime turned into six week on the sideline for james  an inevitability given his age      theproduct of the lakers playing at a much faster pace than lebron s cleveland team  a freak occurrence <BRK>maybe it wa a combination of all those factor <BRK>what s clear  though  is that the lakers  overall poor health ha consistently hurt them <BRK>the lakers  for starter  are     since jan     when lonzo ball  who had begun to impress james a their starting point guard  sustained a serious ankle injury  and there s more <BRK>tyson chandler  the veteran center who made such an impact defensively after joining the team nov     is dealing with a neck ailment  josh hart  the promising second year guard  ha been plagued tendinitis in his left knee for month  and brandon ingram  the swingman with tantalizing potential a a scorer  missed several game with ankle and shoulder problem before he wa ruled out for the rest of the seaon recently with deep venous thrombosis <BRK>in real time  only   day elapsed between new orleans forward anthony davis s trade request going public on jan    and the league s feb    trade deadline  but that surely felt like an eternity for the lakers  quartet of starlet  ingram  ball  hart and kyle kuzma <BRK>especially since the fallout is continuing <BRK>from the minute james arrived in hollywood  after the lakers made unsuccessful trade run at paul george and kawhi leonard  it wa known that the team would try to trade for davis   which meant all four of l a  s top young player were destined to hear their name in trade speculation  yet the leaguewide consensus wa that davis would not be made available until at least the   off season  theoretically giving the starlet an opportunity to build something with james   and maybe even change management s mind about looking externally for lebron s superstar sidekick <BRK>but davis s trade request changed everything  rich paul  lebron s agent and longtime friend  became davis s agent in september and wa widely perceived to have made the trade request on davis s behalf to get him to los angeles  a seemingly ceaseless stream of leaked lakers offer thereafter irreparably fractured the locker room  no matter how hard paul pushed back against that narrative <BRK>nor can the team fully move on from the trade drama  because everyone know the front office will be back on the phone with new orleans soon  trying to beat out the boston celtic  package for davis once the pelican start fielding offer for him anew <BRK>a feb    road loss to the atlanta hawk wa the lakers  fourth in five game entering the all star break and lowered their record to      james emerged from the break insisting that he would shift into playoff mode far earlier than normal    it s been activated   lebron promised   but the lakers promptly lost road game to the davis le pelican and the draft minded memphis grizzly after a hope building home win against the houston rocket <BRK>the season effectively ended march   in phoenix  when the lakers lost to a sun team in the midst of a     funk  the defeat meant l a  had fallen to five of the league s six team which currently have sub    winning percentage  chicago is the only exception   the loss wa soon followed announcement that ball and ingram would be held out of the lakers  remaining game   and that james s minute would be reduced <BRK>james wa held out of friday s game against the detroit piston via the increasingly popular leaguewide synonym for rest    load management   lebron s load  of course  is about to become lighter in april  may and june than anyone expected <BRK>these lakers were never a lock to reach the playoff in the loaded west  but the overwhelming majority of league observer and la vega oddsmakers   who largely pegged them a a   win team   figured lebron would find a way  he ha instead absorbed criticism for spotty leadership and intermittent engagement with his new team a he prepares for life a a playoff spectator for the first time since his second n b a  seaon       <BRK>last summer  when he wa still preaching patience  johnson did say that he would need two off season to assemble a true contender even if the lakers were fortunate enough to land lebron   next summer  if nobody come and i m sitting here like this  then it s a failure   magic said at the time <BRK>but spring ha barely sprung   and next summer is already here for the lakers and james  sooner than they ever envisioned
