 <BRK>  <BRK> by marc stein <BRK> dallas   whether they are trying to keep their   year old playmaker jose juan barea spry or aiming to help their   year old phenom luka doncic dodge the infamous rookie wall  the dallas maverick turn to the same resource  a blood test  <BRK> it is not just any blood test  the maverick import frequent testing from the irish company orreco  which is in it third season making personalized recommendation for maverick player regarding athletic workload and diet  largely through the study of blood analysis  <BRK> although some in the sport medicine community have questioned whether the value of such blood work is overstated  dallas lean heavily on orreco s team of consultant and their assessment of how to maximize player readiness  <BRK>  all the thing n b a  team talk about   player  minute  their load  their tracking data  their camera data   all of that is external data used to try to predict what s going on internally   said casey smith  the head of dallas s athletic training staff   what we re doing is trying to get a little bit of a look at what s actually going on internally   <BRK> dallas is one of just two n b a  team  along with the knicks  to hire orreco  which proposes customized remedy to combat fatigue and try to identify increased risk for injury and illness obtaining a range of data from player  blood and feeding it into machine learning program  <BRK> taking cue from orreco s finding  smith and jeremy holsopple  the maverick  athletic performance director  tailor an individualized mix of training  rest and recovery for each of dallas s   player  the maverick  owner  mark cuban  said the team pay orreco nearly      per year  <BRK> no maverick ha embraced this process more than barea  who understands all too well that fatigued player face an increased risk of soft tissue injury  <BRK> two seaon ago  amid worrisome forecat from what smith referred to a  the number   barea tore a calf muscle in a november   game against boston  <BRK> ever since  barea ha proactively sought update on his level of oxidative stress  worrisome a they get higher  and white blood cell count  which can indicate illness or infection when they spike or indicate le immune prevention a they get lower   <BRK> this season  barea is playing some of his best basketball  averaging     point and     assist in just     minute per game  and said he is  having more fun than ever  while carefully adhering to the suggestion smith give based off orreco s data  <BRK>  i like it   barea said   at this point in my career  you have to work more on the body  they let me know what s going on   like what you need to eat or what you need to stop eating  i want the feedback   <BRK> four time a season  orreco staff member come to dallas to administer a full venous blood draw on maverick player  to supplement those visit  dallas mix in frequent capillary blood draw for it player in which a quick pinprick sample is taken to provide near instant reading of oxidative stress level in the blood from a player s ear or index finger  <BRK> league rule allow player to refuse any blood testing if they find the procedure too invasive  but the team say only one maverick  whom they declined to identify  had done so  <BRK>  it s your health  so it s your decision   smith said  <BRK> the sample  according to the orreco co founder dr  brian moore  enable the firm to analyze a player s hematology and biochemistry assessing nearly   biomarkers  <BRK> this includes examining creatine kinae to as muscle damage and high sensitivity c reactive protein to meaure inflammation   two area of particular concern for baketball player because of the nature of their on court movement  hydration and nutrition indicator   such a vitamin d level  and iron and fatty acid profile   are among the additional variable analyzed to determine where each player land on a four zone  readiness to perform  index  <BRK> along with the biomarker panel  orreco s algorithm also take into account game minute  air mile traveled  sleep data and reaction time that are obtained from wearable device used during practice  <BRK> the rule that allow player to opt out of blood testing are in place because regulating how team use biometrics and the data such research produce   specifically whether the data belongs to the team  player or the league itself   remains an evolving point of concern throughout the n b a  a a safeguard amid the rise of wearable technology in practice session  league policy threatens fine of up to      per team for the misuse of biometric data  <BRK> yet smith insists that the collaboration with orreco ha improved the maverick  ability to track the onset of illness and keep player  more available  for game  in the     season  according to data maintained instreetclothes com  a website that track injury in the n b a   dallas player missed only four game due to illness   le than half the league average of      <BRK> the maverick then lost a league low zero game to illness last season  when the league average wa     game per team  according to the site  <BRK>  doe that mean we win more game   smith said   not necessarily  but it give u a better shot   <BRK> still  with the sport and fitness world littered with treatment not supported vetted published study  some independent expert have their doubt  <BRK> dr  anthony romeo  the chief of orthopedics at the rothman institute in new york and a former team physician for the chicago white sox who also worked with the chicago bull  said he would maintain  a healthy level of skepticism  about orreco s work until it reveals more about the biomarkers it study and the data being gathered  <BRK>  i would be cautious and say it s investigational   romeo said   it s a very interesting area of research and we applaud the effort that they re making  but at this time nothing supplants outstanding coach and trainer that can do a visual analysis and understand their athlete from the traditional method to know whether they re training too hard or too little   <BRK>  at some point   romeo said of orreco   they re going to have to share their data in a way that it can be repeated so that we know it s true   <BRK> said dr  robert dimeff  a team physician for the dallas star of the n h l  and a past president of the american medical society for sport medicine   i think this is a research based tool at this point in time  but i don t think it s ready for prime time  what they re doing is something that in   year from now we may say   wow  this is absolutely great information   <BRK>  we can t say that right now  but what they re doing is trying to put some science behind recommendation and i think that s very admirable   <BRK> despite such skepticism  cuban remains one of the biggest proponent of orreco s work  after watching an interview in which the openly data hungry cuban discussed his growing fascination with artificial intelligence  moore wrote to cuban before the     season with a pitch that orreco could  optimize performance  accelerate recovery and prolong career  using  high end computing to find pattern in the data   <BRK>  our job is to help the maverick make better decision   moore said  <BRK> cuban wa quickly sold  <BRK>  managing player load is a important a understanding traditional baketball analytics    cuban said   causation is always more valuable that correlation   <BRK> although the maverick are hardly alone in embracing bioanalytics  they are on a very short list of top level professional sport franchise that are willing to ignore the ultra secretive norm and publicly acknowledge it work with orreco  <BRK> aide from the maverick  only newcatle united of the english premier league ha acknowledged being an orreco customer  through a person with knowledge of the contract  the time confirmed that the knicks are the other n b a  team to use orreco a extensively a the maverick  <BRK> orreco also consults with a handful of individual player  including wilson chandler of the philadelphia  er and quincy pondexter of the san antonio spur  <BRK> the company  though  said it could not discus the knicks  or the two major league baeball club and another premier league soccer team it count a client  <BRK> smith cited quest diagnostics  blueprint fit a another top practitioner in the field that he suspect ha an n b a  clientele and acknowledged that several of his peer within the league are aware of what dalla is doing  and aking lot of question  <BRK>  and i think there will be more   smith said  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>  <BRK>
