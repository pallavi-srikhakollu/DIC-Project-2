the way outpost to the rough and tumble big   <BRK>now  under the searing spotlight of the final four  mooney ha been simply money <BRK>the self described  short  skinny  kid nobody but the air force academy wanted  who starred for two year at south dakota before transferring to the wind swept west texas plain  etched his name in red raider lore saturday night with a virtuoso performance in the national semifinal <BRK>mooney poured in   point  including a spurt of three   pointer in a       minute second half barrage  sending texas tech to a     victory over michigan state and into a title tilt with virginia <BRK> i m happy for matt  man  this is what we came here for   said tariq owen  himself a transplant from st  john s   he had the biggest game of his career on the biggest stage  <BRK>yet the road wa long and winding  filled with crisis and controversy  doubt and despair <BRK>mooney grew up in the small chicago suburb of wauconda  illinois  and fell in love with the game at an early age  by the time he reached high school  he d make a   minute trek to notre dame college prep to play under longtime nba player jim le rather than attending the local high school <BRK>mooney figured it would best prepare him for college  yet few coach seemed to notice   they were probably too busy watching nearby simeon career academy and the jewel of the   class  jabari parker  who would star at duke before becoming the no    overall pick in the draft <BRK>the only division i scholarship offer mooney received came from air force  and he swallowed the idea of a five year commitment to the military for the chance to play high level hoop <BRK>thing went fairly well on the court  too  mooney averaged     point a a freshman  sharpened his game and proved to a whole lot of doubter he could cut it in division i baketball <BRK>off the court wa another matter <BRK>mooney had trouble adjusting to the rigidity of military life  and he loathed the harsh way the upperclassmen set the tone  he ultimately decided to transfer  and later caused a stir when he accused the academy of promoting a culture of  bullying  that left him feeling depressed <BRK>the academy disputed his claim  and mooney ha since apologized for the accusation  but it didn t change the fact that he needed a fresh start  which mooney found at lower rung south dakota <BRK>for two season  he averaged   point a game and led the coyote to a pile of win <BRK>but they never reached the ncaa tournament  always a step behind mid major star mike daum and rival south dakota state  so when mooney realized he would graduate last may  he once again began looking at transfer option  he settled on an unlikely fit in texas tech  the kid who d chafed at authority making the decision to play for a program whose pillar are structure and defense <BRK>then again  maybe he chose chris beard a much a he chose texa tech <BRK>the red raider coach ha been on an odyssey of his own  cutting his teeth at junior college in kansa and florida  low level school mcmurray and angelo state  even the semi pro aba  before and he got his big break at arkansa little rock and parlayed one year of success into the texas tech gig <BRK>turn out mooney and beard were a match made from basketball morass <BRK> this guy just loved the game   said beard  who fondly recalled visiting mooney s bachelor pad apartment with it sagging couch and his inquisitive roommate while trying to lure him away from chilly vermillion  south dakota   this guy just loved basketball like i do  <BRK>now  the kid nobody wanted and the coach nobody gave anything to have embraced the chance of a lifetime  after winning a share of the regular season big   title  they have marched their way through the ncaa tournament  dispatching michigan state in the semifinal with cold  cruel efficiency <BRK>it wa mooney that had to lead the way <BRK>with star forward jarrett culver struggling and owen hobbling toward the locker room  mooney began to rain down   pointer  on defense  he locked up spartan point guard cassius winston  forcing the big ten player of the year into his worst game of the season <BRK> when he get in that zone   culver said   it s hard to stop him  <BRK>yes  the red raider triumphed because he wa in the zone  will he still be monday night  virginia boast one of the nation s top defense  and shutdown guard ty jerome and kyle guy will likely share the challenge of stopping him  and any chance mooney had of getting overlooked is long gone <BRK>regardless of what happens  though  he promise to enjoy one last night under the light <BRK>the final stop on a memorable voyage through college basketball <BRK> i always thought i could play at this level   mooney said before one last practice sunday   so what i would say to everyone is   chase your dream  pursue your dream   i never thought i d be in this situation  i ve had so many people along the way who have helped me out  <BRK>___<BRK><BRK>
