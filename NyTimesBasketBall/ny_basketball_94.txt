region matchup in salt lake city  and then kept up that pace in the second half  baylor won the   point battle  with    s to syracuse s    and that wa most of the difference in the bear      victory  <BRK> villanova lost four critical member of it championship team to the n b a  draft after last season  but the inexperienced wildcat managed not only to capture the big east title but also their opening round game thursday  outlasting saint mary s     in the south region  the no    wildcat endured the  th seeded gael  slow pace  playing at a tempo coach jay wright called  excruciating   to

combined   point  they felt comfortable in those circumstance  <BRK>  st  mary s is one of the best in grinding out like that in close game   said guard phil booth  who led villanova with   point   you saw what they did against gonzaga in their conference tournament  so the big east really helped u for that   <BRK> villanova will face purdue  a     winner over old dominion  in the second round

 <BRK> the wolf pack have one of the most experienced team in the field  and they just cut their deficit against florida to two point with     left  the twin cody martin    point  and caleb martin

 the martin twin had   of nevada s second half point  their teammate had only five in the final   minute   <BRK> it ha been nine day since gonzaga last played and apparently the long wait   with some saltiness built in after being upset st  mary s in the conference tournament championship game   wa just what the zag needed   <BRK> they have overwhelmed fairleigh dickinson thus far  cruising to a     halftime lead  <BRK> the lopsided margin might not have been that unexpected for a no    seed playing a no     especially one that had to survive a play in game in dayton on tuesday night  fly to salt lake city and adjust to the altitude  <BRK> but the most encouraging note for the zag is the crisp play of killian tillie  their multiskilled but oft injured big man  he scored   point  making both   pointer he attempted  and also kept the ball flowing with crisp pass and moved his foot well on defense  <BRK> tillie ha missed much of the season with a stress fracture on his ankle and then plantar fasciitis  but on thursday night  he look a picture of health  the zag look even better  billy witz <BRK> morant finished with   point    rebound and   assist  and murray state  the  th seed in the west  closed out it first round tackling dummy marquette       if you haven t seen morant play yet  make a point to clear some time saturday to see him and the racer take on no    florida state  <BRK> three teammate joined morant with double digit point total  led the freshman tevin brown  who scored    <BRK> marquette s markus howard  one of the nation s top scorer all season  led all player with   point  though he wa only   for   on   pointer  <BRK> murray state had other notable performer  including guard shaq buchanan and forward darnell cowart  but morant wa the undeniable star  making pass of unsurpassed creativity   to the point that his teammate could not always handle them  any doubt about his n b a  draft stock were dispelled  if it weren t for duke s zion williamson  he might be considered a possible no    overall pick  marc tracy <BRK> morant ha a triple double now    point    assist    rebound  murray state s lead over marquette is     with     left   <BRK> what wa billed a a heavyweight fight within a baketball game did not disappoint through the first half in hartford  a murray state s ja morant and marquette s markus howard traded bakets while their team played largely to a draw  with murray state up     at halftime  <BRK> each star wa clearly his team s best player  marquette s howard  the   point happy junior  led all scorer with   point    of them off   pointer  murray state s morant  who entered averaging   assist a game  wa well on pace to best that  with eight already  he also had   point  on six shot  and   rebound  <BRK> near the end of the half  morant slashed toward the hoop and  while underneath it  acrobatically leapt and squeezed a pas between two defender to teammate tevin brown  who caught it and made a   pointer to put the racer up    later  morant threw an alley oop to a cutting devin gilmore  marc tracy <BRK> kansa finished off northeastern       and believe u  it wasn t that close  dedric lawson had   point and   rebound  and kansa dominated inside  <BRK> the fourth seeded jayhawks       had a big size advantage inside and took full advantage of it  outscoring the husky     in the paint while grabbing   more rebound  kansa shot   percent from the field  <BRK> michigan state coach tom izzo had a right to be nervous  no    bradley  making it first n c a a  tournament appearance in   year  hung with his no    seeded spartan throughout their first round game thursday  and izzo wa even more frenetic than usual dealing with his player and the official  <BRK> then matt mcquaid hit a   pointer and aaron henry converted a floater from the lane on consecutive possession in the final four minute  spurring the spartan to a     victory over the brave  michigan state       advanced to saturday s east regional second round against fellow big ten conference member minnesota  the spartan and the gopher met only once during the regular season  michigan state won    <BRK> bradley        the missouri valley conference champion  led     at halftime on the strength of six   pointer  then added the first two basket of the second half on a layup and dunk elijah child    point    rebound   the lead went back and forth until two foul shot cassius winston with     to play began a decisive run of nine consecutive point for michigan state  winston finished with a game high   point  <BRK> henry s floater in the run made up for a thunderous dunk attempt that clanged high off the rim and out of bound minute earlier  bradley never led again  xavier tillman added   point and   rebound for the spartan  who made   of   foul shot  <BRK> around the same time  sixth seeded maryland  fifth in the big ten this season  rallied to beat no    belmont       belmont actually had the ball last  but turned it over on an ill advised pas in the lane with only second left  maryland  which face l s u  on saturday   minnesota and michigan state are all in the same corner of the east region bracket  pat borzi <BRK> despite the right game plan and a virtual home crowd in hartford  conn   no    seeded vermont failed in it upset bid of no    seeded florida state in a long  grinding game that served a a reminder that  sometime  many time even  goliath win  <BRK> the seminole will play the winner of murray state marquette on saturday  <BRK> beginning the second half tied  vermont broke out to a small lead  which florida state slowly eraed  florida state  rather than attempt a bevy of   pointer  a strategy that backfired in the first half a they went just   for   from deep  instead pounded the ball inside again and again to big men like the   foot   christ koumadje and mfiondu kabengele  who led all player with   point  <BRK> when guard david nichols hit kabengele for a fast break dunk to give the seminole a     lead with around nine minute left  the advantage seemed weirdly insurmountable  in the final minute  florida state drew a few foul and went on a     run to put the game out of reach  marc tracy <BRK> new mexico state  inbounding the ball under the auburn basket with     second left  somehow stumble into an open   pointer in the corner  but queen s rushed shot is an airball  and that s that  <BRK> auburn life       <BRK> whew  what a finish  best of the day so far  but not one auburn will be especially proud of  no matter what coach bruce pearl told his team  <BRK>  you won the basketball game   he said in the locker room afterward   they didn t lose it   <BRK> new mexico state wa left to rue all those chance  especially that last one to win the game  but coach chris jan said he wa proud of his team for making a game of it even when all seemed lost  <BRK>  we all understand this is big boy stuff and there s no moral victory   jan said   but at the same time  i think a lot of team would have picked up their tent and went home  they were fighting and scratching and clawing and they finally put themselves in a position to have a chance to win the game   billy witz <BRK> auburn go   for   at the line  and new mexico state rush the ball upcourt with six second left  eschewing an open layup   and overtime   for a terrell brown   point attempt  auburn  for some reason  foul him  <BRK> brown missed the first attempt  made the second  missed the third on purpose   but the rebound go out of bound and new mexico state will get one final chance   <BRK> auburn alum charles barkley  watching in the studio  is not handling the tension well  <BRK> new mexico state is scaring the heck out of auburn  after forcing a turnover  trevelin queen hit a deeeeeep   pointer from the left wing to cut the tiger  lead to   in the final minute  but two auburn free throw   and one n m s u  miss at the other end   seemed to be the cushion no    seeded auburn needed to escape  <BRK> but new mexico state just hit another   to cut the lead back to   with     second left   <BRK> nervous moment coming up  <BRK> the bulldog  who trailed     and   point at halftime  could not come all the way back against l s u   which made enough free throw down the stretch to win       <BRK> skylar may led the tiger with   point  and kavell bigby williams    point    rebound  and naz reid    point    rebound  both had double double  <BRK> what looked a if it would be a romp in this matchup of university tainted separate scandal in recent week became a taut affair in the waning minute  a the  th seeded bulldog whittled an   point deficit to a few a   point before the no    tiger escaped  <BRK> l s u  overcame the absence of it coach  will wade  who is suspended after he wa connected to a recruiting scandal  with balanced scoring  yale featured one of division i s better offense  ranking ninth in field goal percentage  but the bulldog  poor shooting doomed them  they shot     percent over all and  until drilling four in the final minute  made only four of their first     point attempt   <BRK> alex copeland paced yale  whose athletic department wa drawn into a massive admission fraud scandal last week  with   point  ben shpigel <BRK> amid all the drama over minnesota  louisville and pitino family business  one telling statistic wa easily overlooked  <BRK> while rick pitino s team made their name with effective   point shooting  his son richard brought a gopher team to the n c a a  tournament that had struggled behind the arc all season  minnesota took the court thursday ranked  st in the country in   point percentage  <BRK> and yet  a thing unfolded  minnesota won in the most pitino way  the gopher made     pointer  including five the streaky shooting freshman gabe kalscheur  in an     victory in de moines  <BRK> kalscheur    point  led five gopher in double figure  and the junior guard amir coffey added   point  three   pointer and six rebound  dupree mcbrayer  coffey and kalscheur combined for five   pointer in one stretch of the first half to put minnesota in front for good   <BRK> what s black and white and tread all over  an n c a a  tournament referee   <BRK> the referee  in fact  are the only one team guaranteed to make the final four every year  but the job isn t getting any easier  they  and official in a variety of sport  have become leading character in the passion play of american sport  from the n f l  to tennis to even the little league world series   <BRK> few place can match the high speed pressure cooker of a college basketball arena  where the abuse come from well paid college coach who scream and shout and preen  and from fan who follow their lead   <BRK> read john branch s article about the official here   <BRK> when syracuse coach jim boeheim sat down to speak with reporter on wednesday afternoon in salt lake city  he took a deep breath  let out a long exhale and squinted into the t v  light at the back of the interview room  a if to say   not again   <BRK> syracuse had just announced that the senior point guard frank howard had been suspended  for an indefinite period of time  and would not play in thursday s first round west regional game against baylor   <BRK>  very difficult to make that change now   boeheim said  <BRK> boeheim know this from experience  in    fab melo  then the no
